WINTER 1967
in-between times

5
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:21,523
It was Christmas 1967.
I was about to turn sixteen.

6
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:25,443
I was hopelessly in love
and I wanted to die.

7
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:32,075
Come on Boris.
The girls are cold.

8
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,293
- This way. This is great.
- Open it.

9
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,048
- Tamara!
- Wait a minute.

10
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,718
- Take care.
- Thank you very much.

11
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,554
- All the best.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,390
- This is for you.
- Come on Boris, hurry up.

13
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:00,061
- Thank you Boris.
- Come on, let's go...

14
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:23,668
I give the Bolsheviks one year.
Two at the most.

15
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,336
Hello.

16
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:56,200
- What're you doing?
- Merry Christmas.

17
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,038
Are you nuts?

18
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:08,546
How can you be so cruel?

19
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:12,091
How can you be so cold?

C O S Y D E N S

21
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:28,483
I bought here guitar because
of you

22
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:35,657
And spent each cent of
daddy's heard earned pay

23
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,956
And thought the work to make it
wasn't through

24
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:51,881
I already knew the song
I'd like to play

Bro...

33
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,865
Mom, my brother's dead!

34
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,996
Mom, he's not moving. It's true,
Dad. Mom, he's dead...

35
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,707
You idiot!

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,587
- You have nothing to do today?
- I got you again.

37
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,012
You won't be pissing me off
for long, you bastard.

38
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,809
Speaking. I read you.

39
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:31,105
Roger. Give me extension 205.

40
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,776
Put it on.

41
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,906
It's major Šebek speaking,
get the menu ready!

42
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:45,536
What menu? I didn't say that.

43
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,791
- You said it.
- You made a mistake.

44
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:54,754
Okay, I made a mistake. I'm
preparing a menu for the kids...

45
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,633
Get the reports ready.
Over and out.

46
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,056
- What's for lunch today?
- Stop screaming and go read it.

47
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,478
Are we having
tomato sauce again?

48
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,321
- What do you see?
- Chicken.

49
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:23,825
So you see.

50
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,793
This is ridiculous.

51
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,174
His family destroys
an architectural work

52
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:43,511
and replaces it with a tank!

53
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,602
Do five more for me.

54
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:58,943
One...two...three...

55
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:05,825
Five...

56
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,620
- Jindra!
- Six...!

57
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,540
Seven... I said ten!

58
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:16,210
- You said five.
- I said five but I meant ten.

59
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,274
Come on, slowly.

60
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:42,528
Do you know that one man had the
hiccups for 13 straight years?

61
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,281
Come on, girls...

62
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,491
Hello!

63
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,870
- Hi, aunt.
- At school call me teacher.

64
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,788
Comrade teacher.

65
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,541
Tell your parents we'll come
visit the day after tomorrow.

66
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,793
- What time should I come?
- Come at three.

67
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,570
Will you be
alone for Christmas?

68
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:30,743
Not really. I have
a projector and a piano.

69
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:36,707
- Otherwise it sucks here.
- Thanks for the compliment.

70
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,502
You have a package from America.

71
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,508
- It's from your parents, huh?
- Yeah.

72
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,914
They're awesome.

73
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:24,255
Nice boots.
They'd look good on my mom.

74
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,761
You're full of shit.
Look at your shoes.

75
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,392
Come on in!

76
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,505
Do you have a ticket?

77
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,808
- Elien looks like Jean Marais.
- I hope this one'll be better.

78
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,521
It's so cool
that they show this.

79
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,610
Did you know
Jean Marais likes boys?

80
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,530
- Really?
- He's kidding.

81
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,991
You mentioned the resemblance...

82
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:20,579
- You mean Elien is...
- A fagot...gay...

83
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,081
Quiet!

84
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,104
- Hi.
- Hi.

85
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:52,111
- So I look like Jean Marais?
- Jiřina said that.

86
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:25,436
I told you not to bike on ice,
but you didn't listen.

87
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,565
They were kissing, kissing
for so damn long!

88
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,404
Why are you running
in the house.

89
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,574
Didn't I tell you to get
a haircut for Christmas?

90
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:45,831
- It's like Aesop's hair.
- Esau's dad.

91
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,499
Him too.

92
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,920
Go and vacuum!
Don't just hang around!

93
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,131
Let me help you.

94
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:58,969
- Why isn't aunt Eva coming?
- She'll come on Christmas Day.

95
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,599
- She has a visitor today.
- Comrade teacher?

96
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,851
Damn, I hope it fits now...

97
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,771
Yes, comrade teacher.

98
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:16,028
Love is fatal disease

99
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:22,159
Each has his own
heart's ease

100
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:32,002
Listen to how I myself
found release

101
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,561
Merry Christmas!
One moment, please.

102
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,734
- Pét'a, hurry up.
- It's occupied.

103
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,196
For how long?

104
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,576
A while.

105
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,514
It's free.

106
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:34,690
- What stinks in here?
- The heather. Just my luck.

107
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:45,951
Jesus Christ was born,
let us be merry

108
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:55,961
the bud bloomed into a rose,
let us enjoy it.

109
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:07,014
Of pure life, of royal family

110
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,519
he was born for us...

111
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:23,155
He was born for us...
She's smiling. See?

112
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,741
She's smiling!

113
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:35,125
And if they splashed boiling
oil in my face she'd be what?

114
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,752
She'd be smiling!

115
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,006
And it's actually so simple.

116
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:49,014
It was supposed to be a C minor
but what did we hear instead?

117
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:56,688
The butcher smiles in spite
of her sub-normal intelligence

118
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:01,235
and hangs out with a local freak
right under her father's eyes.

119
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,114
You could beat her to death,
and still she'd play...

120
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,450
And it's actually so simple.

121
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:16,750
Jesus Christ was born...

122
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:36,019
He was born for us!

123
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:42,484
- I don't have an ear for music!
- My own blood doesn't hear it?

124
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:47,156
Your mother
and I have perfect pitch!

125
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:51,827
You do it on purpose!
Play it again!

126
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:56,582
- Are you feeling better today?
- Yes. Don't worry. It's okay.

127
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,751
- It's better today.
- I think I said something!

128
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,006
Saboteurs.

129
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,848
- We bring you news...
- Mom.

130
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,767
- Hi.
- Welcome.

131
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:22,024
- Bóža.
- Oh please, give it to me.

132
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,786
Come on, young man.

133
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:42,711
- Sing a carol for us.
- Jesus Christ was born...

134
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,631
Shut up. Can't you at least stop

135
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,925
these political provocations
at Christmas.

136
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,096
- No betting today, guys.
- Václav! Grandma!

137
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,558
My beloved sister in law.

138
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,730
- Where's your sister?
- She'll come tomorrow.

139
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:07,819
- She has a serious date tonight.
- Thank God she has a man!

140
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:13,075
- A biology teacher!
- A biology teacher!

141
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,747
- You are absolutely radiant.
- Really? I feel completely...

142
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,582
Come have a look.

143
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,044
For God sake, take it out.

144
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,630
Wait, calm down!
I'll take it out.

145
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:30,634
You always get me!
What a Christmas...

146
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:36,348
Wait. Take your shoes off here!
We have a new carpet.

147
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,850
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Shut up. Take your shoes off.

148
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,479
- Did you get these at work?
- No way. They're brand new.

149
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:49,361
You see brother.
He's a biology teacher.

150
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:54,116
He will explain that four
meter tall bear to you.

151
00:17:54,241 --> 00:18:01,081
I'm just saying what the TV said.
A kodiak bear is 3.7 meters tall.

152
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,251
- Will you have a shot?
- Sure.

153
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,628
Three meters seventy...

154
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:12,259
Three meters seventy.
That's like an African elephant!

155
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,928
- So what?
- Boys, please...

156
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,432
You can't believe
everything they say on TV.

157
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:25,981
I just said that they said
it rises on its hind legs

158
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,109
and measures three meters
seventy. Maybe more!

159
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:33,030
Don't believe the hype.
I'm one meter eighty five.

160
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:37,117
- I'm one eighty three. So what?
- Get on my back.

161
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:41,538
- Stop it.
- Try to touch the ceiling.

162
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,875
Try it and when you touch it,

163
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,127
we will see how big
your kodiak bear is.

164
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:52,633
Watch out. The kodiak is coming.
I'll climb up. Hold on to this.

165
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,763
Okay. Be careful. Wait...

166
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,973
Now I have to get on you
somehow.

167
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,560
You gotta get on
your back legs...

168
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,605
You're the back legs,
I'm raising my front paws.

169
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,317
Stand still. Be careful.
I'm going up.

170
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,444
- Come on, idiot.
- Jesus.

171
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,281
Make a mark there.

172
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,451
How am I supposed
to make a mark?

173
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:24,790
- Use your claw.
- He's nuts. Jesus...

174
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,918
Uzlinka, hand me a fork.

175
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,836
- Growl dad.
- What did you say?

176
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,048
- Growl.
- I'll show you once I get down.

177
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,592
Hand it to me carefully
so you don't get hurt.

178
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:41,098
- I got it. I'll make a mark.
- Didn't you already have enough?

179
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,184
- Quit staring and measure it.
- And the magic word?

180
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,186
- Excuse me?
- The magic word!

181
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,815
I'll kill you, you bastard.

182
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,152
Hold on.

183
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,411
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,999
- What's up?
- Elien is sorry.

185
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,128
Every year's the same.

186
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:16,466
- He admitted he went too far.
- It's okay.

187
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,928
He's sending you this
to make up for it.

188
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,351
Thanks.

189
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,029
Jindřiška!
We haven't poured the lead yet!

190
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:42,534
- Lead's dead.
- We're measuring a bear.

191
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,081
- See you.
- Merry Christmas.

192
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,551
Damn women! Don't touch me!

193
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,807
Am I at the sink yet?

194
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,200
What can you see, Jindřich?

195
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:31,041
I give the Bolsheviks one year.
Two at the most.

196
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,176
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

197
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,387
- Don't you think it's magic?
- I do.

198
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,014
Look.

199
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,187
I love glass.

200
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,859
I always wanted a paperweight.

201
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:04,366
- It's not just a paperweight.
- What is it then?

202
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,751
A kodiak bear...

203
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:18,630
I heard one man had the hiccups
for 13 straight years.

204
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:22,467
Can't you hold your breath
for a little while?

205
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:29,933
As a boy I could stay under
water for a minute and a half.

206
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:35,063
Under water. You can't breathe
through the skin and pores.

207
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,275
- Stop it!
- It's a piece of cake.

208
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,488
Pét'a said that pearl divers can
stay under water for 15 minutes.

209
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,241
Come on, that's impossible.

210
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,785
- Why not?
- Fifteen minutes?

211
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,206
- Sure.
- You can't even last a minute.

212
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,043
Why couldn't I last a minute?

213
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:02,048
- Come on, boys.
- Well? Let's try it.

214
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,010
From now on I won't argue,
I'll bet.

215
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,557
- One crown for every second.
- Okay.

216
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:16,313
Anything under a minute is yours,
anything over is mine. Deal?

217
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,441
Let's go.

218
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:24,654
- Three, two, one...
- You have to follow me.

219
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:29,326
- Okay, you say it.
- Ready, steady, go!

220
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,543
- Finished?
- Not yet.

221
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,505
Not at all. Hold your nose!
Plug your nostrils.

222
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:46,217
Okay, I'll plug my nose.
It's not such a big deal.

223
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:50,764
Ready, steady, go!

224
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,062
He's breathing.

225
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,818
I can hear him breathe.

226
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,742
He's breathing.

227
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:17,707
I can see it. I can hear it. I'm
not timing you. You can breathe.

228
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:21,378
I'm finished. It's off.
I'm not timing you.

229
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,007
He's getting red.

230
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,764
Come on, brother. A blood vessel
in your brain might burst.

231
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:39,396
You're not young anymore.
You'll crumple like a leaf.

232
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,817
He's a dumb ass.

233
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:49,781
- He'd be willing to kill himself.
- How long did he last?

234
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,577
- No good. He isn't under water.
- What do you mean?

235
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:59,040
- It's like biking down a hill.
- What do you mean?

236
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,878
- You don't need to peddle!
- Do you peddle under water?

237
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:14,556
- What's under the tree?
- I wished for a crossbow.

238
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:17,183
Oh no, a crossbow?

239
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:25,942
Let's go to the bathroom!

240
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,326
Excuse me, little girl.

241
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,332
Boys!

242
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,670
Excuse me, bigger girl.

243
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:58,099
You see. He isn't breathing.

244
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,947
One minute one second.
I owe you a crown!

245
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:18,787
That was incredible, man!
You're an amphibian!

246
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:23,792
What did you make for dinner?
The carp is still in the tub!

247
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:28,004
I bought one already sliced
two days ago.

248
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:33,510
You mean you can kill the carp?
Your dad isn't around anymore.

249
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,059
You can't, huh?

250
00:26:55,323 --> 00:27:03,998
Let's remember those who can't
be at our Christmas table.

251
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:11,756
Let's sit in silence and pray
for those who died in the war

252
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:18,638
and for my tortured friends
from the resistance movement.

253
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,336
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name

254
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,756
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

255
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:58,219
On earth as it is in heaven

256
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,638
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses

257
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,141
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us...

258
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,226
Amen.

259
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:10,023
Amen.

260
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,491
Enjoy your meal.

261
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,430
Merry Christmas!

262
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,686
Uzlinka!

263
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,029
A crossbow!

264
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,076
- Who gave it to her?
- Santa Claus.

265
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:06,329
He still uses
the same wrapping paper.

266
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:10,500
I wonder what this is, mom.

267
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:16,256
- You know what it is.
- No, I don't.

268
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:26,641
Oh boy!
Genuine Stolichnaya vodka!

269
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,982
- Don't open it now!
- Is it from Uncle Boris?

270
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:40,571
The tree holder's from Uncle
Boris. He'll be back in summer.

271
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:47,120
I wonder what this is.

272
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,981
Thanks, dad.

273
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,329
Thanks, dad.

274
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,091
Pretty good, huh?

275
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:42,860
This is something
for mom from dad.

276
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:55,581
- Drinking glasses?
- Go ahead. Shake it.

277
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:21,941
We needed these badly!
Ours are already broken.

278
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:27,447
That's right.
Ours are already broken.

279
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:35,037
Did you notice anything
unusual about these glasses?

280
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,750
- They're light.
- This is...

281
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,338
This is not funny.

282
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,554
Just watch, you heckler!

283
00:32:53,681 --> 00:33:01,522
What happens when you drop
an ordinary glass on the floor?

284
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:04,734
- It breaks.
- Exactly. It breaks.

285
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:12,867
An ordinary glass will break.
That's how it used to be.

286
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:17,997
But then a couple of smart guys
got together...

287
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:24,003
Stop grinning!

288
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:35,681
It's no coincidence that
they all came from Poland.

289
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:39,227
- Socialist Poland!
- I see.

290
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:43,648
Madam Curie-Sklodowska, or
Glass-ska came from Poland.

291
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,902
Well...

292
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:55,493
- It's unbreakable glass.
- What do you mean?

293
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,623
It's a miracle.

294
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,209
Can I try it?

295
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,338
Lída!

296
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:14,345
- How hard can I smash it?
- Go all the way, girl!

297
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,602
The glassmakers
won't have anything to eat.

298
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,021
Granny...

299
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:33,531
It means we're one step
ahead of them!

300
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,494
- How did you like the test?
- It wasn't hard enough.

301
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,957
You think so?

302
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:47,837
Okay then. Go ahead, big man!

303
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:56,304
Who do you think you're helping?

304
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,853
The other side?

305
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:14,655
Did you notice the weird shards?

306
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:23,539
They're round like flowers,
and don't cut you!

307
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:28,544
Really. I've never seen
anything like that.

308
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:38,804
This is strange. It's four of us
at the table all year around,

309
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,517
and we've got five of them.

310
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,191
It means one try
for everybody, right?

311
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,529
HOLD ON, PIONEER!

312
00:35:56,781 --> 00:36:00,576
- What is it?
- It's a very interesting thing.

313
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:05,581
I bought it during
a fellowship in Kiev.

314
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,291
- Do you know Kiev?
- Yes, I do.

315
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,628
It's a beautiful city.
Everything is new.

316
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:14,006
That's where I got this thing
"Hold on, pioneer."

317
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,716
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

318
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:22,306
It's a toy that makes boys
like you over there stronger.

319
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,351
It hurts!

320
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:31,148
- Are you okay Pét'a?
- It just numbs you a bit.

321
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:37,238
The object and fun of the game
is to hold on. Turn it on!

322
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:42,410
Turn it on,
grit you teeth and hold on.

323
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,332
Why are you shaking so much?

324
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,336
Because electric power's
running inside me.

325
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:57,925
- So let go of it.
- I can't.

326
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,554
Electric power's running in me.
The boy has to turn it off.

327
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:06,600
- Turn it off, Pét'a.
- Turn it off for a minute.

328
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,061
Turn it off!!!

329
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:14,066
- Well...?
- I don't think it's a safe toy.

330
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:18,779
I'm a biology teacher, I know
what I can take. Come try it.

331
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:21,198
- I don't want to.
- Take it. It's fun.

332
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,826
- I just grab it. Turn it on.
- But not too much!

333
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:26,620
He can turn it all the way up,
it doesn't matter.

334
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:31,667
- It's not doing anything.
- It can't. We're not touching.

335
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:37,590
The bodies are touching...
Blooming in May...

336
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,428
- Exciting, huh?
- It hurts.

337
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:50,561
It's beautiful, Vilma!
I don't deserve such a thing.

338
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:58,027
But the gift that brings
the most happiness

339
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:03,449
is one made by a man himself.

340
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,954
That's right. It's for me?

341
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:16,086
Thank you, Jindřich.
Jack of all trades, right?

342
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:19,006
Is it a dog?

343
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:25,387
- It's a camel!
- Where did you learn this?

344
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,224
At camp during the war.

345
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:35,773
I even made bread chess once.

346
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:44,698
- From white and black bread?
- No from soggy war rations!

347
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:49,203
You are looking
at the origins of life.

348
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:55,167
It began here and its apex is
our existence. It's a miracle!

349
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,215
I've got Gott's 45! Come on.

350
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:29,803
- Something really stinks here.
- Frankincense.

351
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:36,644
Come on, frankincense
can't smell that bad.

352
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,234
- Are you nuts?
- Screwing is for kids.

353
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,365
Men will drink! Right?

354
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:55,663
- Now something stinks here.
- Drop it, mother.

355
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:06,340
I'll show you something
you've never seen before.

356
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:13,514
For God Sake, Bohouš...
Stop it!

357
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:23,107
Quiet! Do you know what
soldiers in a trench do

358
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:27,277
when they need to warm up...

359
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,990
- What?
- Does anybody know?

360
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:43,408
They... name... bullets...
individually...

361
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:47,965
- Name bullets individually?
- What?

362
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,931
You won't do that.

363
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,310
- Marshall Malinovsky!
- Brother.

364
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,195
- Dad!
- What?

365
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,283
You're the man!

366
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:28,338
Hands up!

367
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:33,135
I promote you to the position
of poster of bulletins.

368
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:57,302
- Let's have a drink.
- Later.

369
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:03,142
Let's light the frankincense.
Just for the smell...

370
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:11,733
- Is doing it on Christmas O.K.?
- Yes, it is.

371
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:16,363
You're my best present, Eva.
I'm going to unwrap you.

372
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,743
Raise your hands...

373
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,455
Bend forward...

374
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,712
Come on... sit down.

375
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,928
- I'll take your shoes off first.
- Wait. Give me that shoe!

376
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:44,183
Now the other shoe.
Shoes, beautiful legs...

377
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:53,108
Do you see it, Eva?
Do you like it?

378
00:44:56,528 --> 00:45:00,032
Take it in your hands
and just feel the energy.

379
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:03,243
- I don't want it.
- Come on, take it.

380
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:07,247
I'm praying on my knees.
Feel the energy.

381
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:12,252
And now your earring
like icing on a cake.

382
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:21,053
- Isn't this exciting?
- I don't know. I feel sick.

383
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,096
- Mom...
- Yes!

384
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:27,100
Hurry! Turn the light off!

385
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:34,691
- Teacher, can I ask something?
- Yes.

386
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,194
- Does shit burn?
- Pét'a!

387
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,364
- What's he saying?
- Does shit burn?

388
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:46,870
Camel shit does,
for example. It's true.

389
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,039
It's true.
Do you know what time it is?

390
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,124
- What time is it?
- It's late.

391
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,170
We said we would always
choose dads together.

392
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:59,174
Go to bed or I'll take away
your microscope

393
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:03,011
and you'll get it back at
the end of the school year!

394
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,013
Don't look at me and go!

395
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,642
Good night. Be a good boy.

396
00:46:26,243 --> 00:46:31,290
So I'm being interviewed
for the position of father.

397
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:37,170
I'm making a nice Christmas Eve
for the incomplete family.

398
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:41,466
I'm making fiction, some kind
of illusion for the boy,

399
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:46,263
a sixth-grader
who is going to judge me.

400
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:52,811
He will decide whether we can
spend a couple of hours in bed.

401
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:58,025
I came
with the offer of quality sex.

402
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:04,865
Bamboo chopping...
the milk & water position...

403
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:10,245
Long hours of homework all
in vain. All because of your...

404
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,250
- Good night.
- Come on, Saša.

405
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:20,922
- Don't force yourself.
- I'm not forcing myself.

406
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:23,383
Just be quiet and quick, please.

407
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,386
- Eva...
- Quickly.

408
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:31,350
- Are you sure you want it?
- I'm sure.

409
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:38,899
- You know, Eva...
- Ouch! -Sorry!

410
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:44,196
- It's okay.
- You make me infinitely happy.

411
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:46,073
That's good, Saša.

412
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,868
- I'll be quiet, don't worry.
- Quiet and quick.

413
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,960
Eva...

414
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,674
What is it?

415
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,390
Damn it! I've had enough of
this. This is pissing me off...

416
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,768
Mom!

417
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,437
I will...

418
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:16,288
Who's this ugly hippie here?

419
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,419
You mean Gagarin's brother?

420
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,446
I wanted to pass
the bulletin board on to you.

421
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,325
You bastard!

422
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,447
- How high is it, doctor?
- Higher than last time.

423
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:36,076
We've got to do something about
your blood pressure.

424
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:39,246
Two or three days
at our clinic would help.

425
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:40,872
I can't do that.

426
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,586
- Are you taking those pills?
- Sometime I forget.

427
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:50,090
You mustn't.
They're very important.

428
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:55,929
Let's have something stronger
before lunch, professor.

429
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:07,899
I have 12 year old, 60 % plum
brandy from doctor Vacenovský.

430
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,325
- Vilma, have a thimbleful.
- Mrs. Vilma can't drink.

431
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,579
- But professor...
- Her blood pressure is too high.

432
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:23,915
- I'll drink for mom.
- This isn't eggnog, young lady.

433
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,128
This is a man's drink! Do you
actually know how to drink this?

434
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:38,252
First, you raise the glass.
You can smell the pit.

435
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:42,100
You have to suck in...

436
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,607
The pain!

437
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:01,745
Are you trying to kill me,
you bastards? Get up!

438
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,956
You're dismissed! Both of you!

439
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,667
- Well?
- What?

440
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,920
How about that teacher of yours?

441
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,506
I don't know.

442
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,888
He's slimy, isn't he?

443
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,017
Yeah.
Pét'a doesn't like him either.

444
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:29,481
- Can we play that new record?
- You better not.

445
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:32,400
- Auntie...
- Of course you can. -Thanks!

446
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:37,072
Will Bohouš mind?

447
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:41,159
Let's have someone else
yell here for a while.

448
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,747
I might put an ad in the paper.

449
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:50,835
- An ad?
- Pét'a needs a father.

450
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,797
Come on, Eva...

451
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:57,217
Walk without a hunched back
and it'll happen.

452
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:34,254
Thank you.

453
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:43,388
We always have pork with sauce
and dumplings on Christmas Day.

454
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:48,893
Right, Vilma? Professor
has always had seconds.

455
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,603
I like it very much.

456
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:58,528
- Can we begin? Bon Appétit.
- You too.

457
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:14,002
The sauce curdled a bit somehow.
It's not really perfect.

458
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:21,551
- No way. It's delicious.
- It's been better before.

459
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:26,639
A good housewife
is always unsatisfied.

460
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:29,976
That's true. It's delicious!

461
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:42,238
Aren't the dumplings
a bit mushy?

462
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:47,994
Gnocchi should have
a slightly mushy surface.

463
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:54,501
Did I hear you right?
Did you say gnocchi?

464
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:57,086
Yeah, mom's gnocchi.

465
00:54:57,212 --> 00:55:02,217
Gnocchi have a slimy surface
and are light and fluffy inside.

466
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:08,431
Are you sure you didn't mean
mom's delicious dumplings?

467
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:12,352
I'm talking about
mom's delicious gnocchi.

468
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:19,651
You mean these true and only
Viennese potato dumplings?

469
00:55:19,776 --> 00:55:22,111
How do you dare to call them...

470
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:25,323
- Gnocchi!
- Dumplings!

471
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:30,787
Let me explain the difference
between dumplings and gnocchi.

472
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:35,458
Dumplings are long cylindrical
shapes cooked in boiling water,

473
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:40,004
then cut into thin slices
after being taken out of water.

474
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:45,051
Therefore, dumpling slices
are slimy only on the edges.

475
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:48,263
On the other hand,
typical gnocchi

476
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:54,435
are made into little balls and
each piece is cooked separately.

477
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:59,649
Therefore, it's slimy
on the whole surface.

478
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,946
It seems pretty logical to me.

479
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:08,950
Vilma! How did you cook
these dumplings?

480
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,746
In steam, wrapped in a napkin.

481
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:16,082
Well, what do you have
to say about that?

482
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:20,503
- Gnocchi can be steamed, right?
- Yes, they can.

483
00:56:20,837 --> 00:56:26,217
If you don't know how to treat
your father in front of guests

484
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:29,262
then get out off my sight!

485
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,222
Can I finish chewing
my last gnocchi?

486
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:34,309
Leave the last dumpling
and get out!

487
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:39,147
Maybe I made dumplings
and I ended up with gnocchi.

488
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:44,360
It's a disgusting excuse!

489
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:50,074
You, chef from a five-star hotel,
don't know what you're serving.

490
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:54,329
You might not know it,
but I'd never dine on

491
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:57,832
anything as disgusting
as gnocchi!

492
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:02,462
How dare you talk about
mother's cuisine like this?

493
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:08,593
Don't you know what a typical
Viennese potato dumpling is?

494
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:11,679
- Gnocchi!
- Dumplings!

495
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:17,435
- Come on, Jindra!
- Calm down, mom!

496
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,857
My priest taught me to respect
my mother and father,

497
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:26,945
and this is the result of the
materialistic way of upbringing.

498
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,073
Choke on those gnocchi!

499
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:36,412
This is my house and nothing,
not even that dumpling, is yours.

500
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,249
This is your fault. This is the
result of your poor rearing!

501
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:43,962
I should have brought her up!

502
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:47,423
But I wouldn't be able to leave
the house for even a second!

503
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:51,844
I'd have to be here with a whip
from sunrise to sunset!

504
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:57,517
You think I haven't noticed
you whispering:

505
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:04,565
"Quick before dad comes."
This is just unbearable!

506
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:11,614
I let these vipers into my heart.
I mean a whole nest of vipers!

507
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:15,576
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, we have a visitor.

508
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:18,413
Everybody doesn't have
to hear this.

509
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:23,376
Let everybody hear it!
You didn't give me a son.

510
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:28,631
What can I expect
from a woman like you?

511
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,136
Professor...

512
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:39,600
Does that brat realize
I take nitroglycerin?

513
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:41,686
Calm down, Jindřich.

514
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:47,442
I was interrogated
by the Nazis!!!

515
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:51,237
You can't beat me
with something like gnocchi.

516
00:58:55,658 --> 00:59:01,289
Take it away.
These gnocchi make me sick.

517
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:11,215
Who asked
for your opinion anyway?

518
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:17,096
Once you raise your own daughter
you can come talk to your father.

519
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,557
Did you see it, professor?

520
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:25,646
She takes French, English and
the piano, and she's a monster.

521
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:29,192
Let me quote
this respected publication:

522
00:59:29,317 --> 00:59:32,779
Delicate Viennese gnocchi
can be prepared in steam...

523
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:38,659
I gave you life!!!

524
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:44,999
This is the result
of your choice of friends.

525
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:50,296
An anarchist bohemian and
a red Bolshevik gnocchi!!!

526
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:06,312
- What would you like?
- Dad wishes you happy holidays.

527
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:10,942
And asks if you could keep quiet
at least on Christmas Day.

528
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:12,652
Your dad...

529
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:22,411
Come say it yourself,
you communist pig!

530
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:29,836
You needn't to send a messenger!
This isn't the General's office!

531
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,505
Everybody knows something.

532
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,507
Do you know
who started the Beatles?

533
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:38,344
You think it was some Czech
patriots?

534
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,015
- Since when do you have X-mas?
- I'm gonna go nuts.

535
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:47,478
You're such a pig! You even get
wasted on Christmas Eve!

536
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:51,816
Fuck you! If you have
another heart attack,

537
01:00:51,941 --> 01:00:55,236
I won't be there again to help
you, you son of a bitch!

538
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:59,157
No one ever asked you for that!

539
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:04,745
This is my house! My apartment!
I can yell as much as I want!

540
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:09,917
You got it for jerking off
on an army base,

541
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:17,049
but I got it for years
spent in a Nazi prison!

542
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:20,678
There's no soldier,
like a real soldier.

543
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:26,392
- I'm sorry. Good day, madam.
- Hello.

544
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:29,645
- Merry Christmas.
- To you as well. Go Pét'a.

545
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,235
- Hello.
- Hi.

546
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,990
- Can Jindra go out?
- Never... ever!

547
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:47,580
The guitar and I now stand
before your home

548
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:55,296
Take pity please at least
on this poor tree

549
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:02,345
That gave its life to sing
for you alone

550
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:10,853
And ask us in,
the guitar and me

551
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:17,652
The guitar and me

552
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,951
- SPRING 1968 - It's time
- Pét'a! Help me. Quick.

553
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,217
- Big changes, huh?
- That's life.

554
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:42,551
It was about time.

555
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:47,890
This is good. At least we have
some true women in the audience.

556
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:52,937
It's better
to talk to the crowd.

557
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:58,526
You boys and girls don't need
to be shy to come to our station

558
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,611
to see our workplace.

559
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:04,782
Perhaps we're holding you
a bit, comrade police officer,

560
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:08,869
but as we have such a rare
chance, and some young men

561
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:13,332
may be considering the police
as their future occupation,

562
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,629
could you tell us some stories
from your professional life?

563
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:21,799
I'm sure you are full
of thrilling stories!

564
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:29,473
It's basically busywork -
mostly paperwork.

565
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:33,978
- Please...
- Please...

566
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:41,527
We got the order to eliminate
a saboteur on a motorbike.

567
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,447
A man with a leather backpack.

568
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:52,121
Our position was at a blind turn.
We hid on a bluff by a pond.

569
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,791
It was about two thirty

570
01:03:55,916 --> 01:04:00,713
when a man on a bike approached
us with a leather backpack.

571
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:11,974
He was an offender, of course.
A murderer most likely.

572
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,144
They must be treated
without kindness.

573
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:17,855
It's not like working
with a magnetic needle, kids.

574
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:22,985
As soon as the shooting stopped
we heard another motorbike.

575
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,988
A man with a leather backpack
was driving it.

576
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,868
The order was clear:
He can't get by at any cost!

577
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:41,087
There was no time
to contemplate who was who.

578
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:44,256
You mean...

579
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:54,266
That's right. Two rounds.
I gotta go. Duty calls.

580
01:04:54,392 --> 01:04:56,060
That's pretty harsh, huh?

581
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:13,536
...when leading a society,
people must trust politicians.

582
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:21,168
If there is somebody saying
that today's party's politics

583
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:28,050
are just a matter of us,
that person knows very little...

584
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:31,303
- Talking about politics!
- About communist politics...

585
01:05:31,429 --> 01:05:36,016
What do they want to reform?
It's always the same people!

586
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:40,020
The same bastards.

587
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,818
Thieves and murderers.

588
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:51,657
They want to turn the events of
1948 into a democratic movement.

589
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,287
- Look here!
- Show me.

590
01:05:56,412 --> 01:06:01,000
- With jumping ropes! Come here.
- Good looking, huh?

591
01:06:03,878 --> 01:06:07,298
This minister gets
almost no sleep

592
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:12,261
because she can get more work
done in the morning.

593
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:15,931
She is an emancipated woman,
nice and alert.

594
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:20,728
She likes doing it
because she's emancipated.

595
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:24,940
- She looks like a cleaning lady!
- Shut the door.

596
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,651
- Why?
- Someone might hear you.

597
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,403
And they'll lock you up again.

598
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:39,038
Proletariats of all countries,
fuck off!

599
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:48,130
Now I feel relieved, my dear.

600
01:06:53,302 --> 01:06:58,057
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing.

601
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:04,313
No one believes that you are
okay. You just groaned.

602
01:07:04,438 --> 01:07:09,193
- I didn't groan.
- Come on, you did.

603
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:12,279
Why would you groan
if you were okay?

604
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:19,620
I've been watching you for days.

605
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:24,792
You are getting pale like Death
vanishing before my eyes.

606
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:29,463
You can tell me everything!
Even that you don't feel good.

607
01:07:35,803 --> 01:07:39,974
Now you groan! Try to deny it.

608
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,813
My daughter is rude...

609
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:53,028
and the old hypochondriac
is constantly groaning here!

610
01:07:53,279 --> 01:08:02,413
Do I, the war invalid after
three heart attacks, groan?

611
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:06,292
Do I bother anybody here
with it? No, I don't!

612
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:22,766
Sorry. I know you are sick.
Me too.

613
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:53,255
I never got married because
I'm a variety artist.

614
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:00,095
It's a nomadic life.

615
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:05,225
It's an adventure...
tricks, charms, magic.

616
01:09:08,604 --> 01:09:10,898
I'm on a special diet.

617
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:39,885
It's a lonesome life.
That's why I answered your ad.

618
01:09:40,052 --> 01:09:45,933
I should probably show you
something. Naturally.

619
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:11,750
- How long have you been at this?
- From my youth. Sorry.

620
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,752
Basically since childhood.

621
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:19,007
Sorry,
let's finish that trick.

622
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:27,433
- Pavel, blow.
- My name is Pét'a.

623
01:10:30,477 --> 01:10:35,524
- That's old.
- You'd be amazed. It still works.

624
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:03,051
I'm sorry.

625
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:18,567
- Check you out!
- Hello.

626
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:21,278
The youth are here doing
something for their health.

627
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:24,364
Show me
your smoker's papers, kids.

628
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:30,954
It's spring. The young people
are dating instead of studying.

629
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:34,875
Somebody may rely on his parents,
but hormones are working.

630
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:38,045
Everything in nature is pairing.

631
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:43,050
It looks like somebody is a
third wheel here. Right, Šebek?

632
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:47,638
No matter how I count:
one, two...

633
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,390
- You know what? Fuck you.
- Excuse me?

634
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:53,185
Fuck you!

635
01:11:57,064 --> 01:12:01,944
A hippie in the family
of an army officer.

636
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:06,782
Now you're playing the hero,
but what will your dad say?

637
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:21,588
Hello? Hi dad. Fine...

638
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,675
He's got the best life.
His parents are in America.

639
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:04,381
- What about this?
- Show me.

640
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,719
That's grandpa.
Your grandfather.

641
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:20,272
- It's nice when dad isn't home!
- Don't say such stuff.

642
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,446
Can I join you in bed?

643
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:30,115
- You'll be hot.
- No, I won't.

644
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,119
Then come on in.

645
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:56,391
- Sour.
- What do you mean sour?

646
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:01,521
They can't be sour. They're
from professor Rhon from Bubeneč.

647
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,235
They are pretty gross!

648
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,241
Was he like this
when you were still dating?

649
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,495
Who? Your father?

650
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,710
No, he wasn't.

651
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:27,130
Who are you going out
with anyway?

652
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:36,264
With the handsome guy?
Or with the neighbor?

653
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,392
Who would you go out with?

654
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:47,025
- It's an easy question.
- Well, I'm like you.

655
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,863
So you go out with Elien?

656
01:15:01,957 --> 01:15:04,376
He is a bit like your father.

657
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:14,136
Then it's gonna be hell.
I won't be able to take it.

658
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:30,610
Do you think Elien and my father
have anything in common?

659
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:37,617
- How did you get that idea?
- I don't know. What do you think?

660
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:42,247
Actually they do.

661
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,377
- Don't be so pathetic.
- Don't ask me next time.

662
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,971
- Look. He's hanging out here.
- Michal.

663
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:02,184
Ssssh. Quiet. Don't startle him!

664
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:07,147
Don't be silly.

665
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:18,617
- I got you, you bastard!
- What's wrong?

666
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:22,079
Wait, you bastard! I'll show you.
I'm telling you to stand still!

667
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:24,748
- I will. Once you calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

668
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,793
- Dad, don't embarrass me here.
- Come on, Bóža!

669
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:31,254
Okay, let's talk about it.
Man to man. Okay?

670
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,048
- Have you calmed down yet?
- Completely.

671
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,884
- Can we talk now?
- Okay, but stay where you are.

672
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:38,428
- I'm not moving, damn it.
- Mom, he's moving, right?

673
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,722
This isn't working.
We had a deal, right?

674
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:44,935
- You don't believe your own dad?
- No, I don't.

675
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,437
- Did you hear it?
- Good evening.

676
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,526
Hello. Jindřiška.

677
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:57,030
What would your dad say
if you talked to him like this?

678
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:01,660
We sure achieved something.
You bastard!

679
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,914
Wait until you get home!

680
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:17,759
- Apologize to your teacher!
- He started it!

681
01:17:18,844 --> 01:17:20,137
You idiot!

682
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:32,858
Thank you.

683
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,914
I haven't been to the movies
for fifteen years at least.

684
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,337
Jindra!

685
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:59,467
Come home.

686
01:18:01,136 --> 01:18:02,596
Come home!

687
01:19:57,377 --> 01:20:03,049
This chair is pretty low. I feel
like I'm sitting in an armchair.

688
01:20:05,927 --> 01:20:11,850
But the food is delicious. It's
much better than canteen food.

689
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:17,188
I only eat in the canteen, and
their cooking isn't like yours.

690
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:21,276
You should know that
Pét'a is a pretty naughty kid.

691
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:29,784
I like kids and I do lectures.
That was why I answered your ad.

692
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,286
I see.

693
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:37,083
- Do you want to see my gun?
- No.

694
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,711
Guys always want to see a gun.

695
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:41,838
- Can I ask you something?
- No.

696
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:46,051
- What would you like to know?
- I wonder...

697
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:49,179
It doesn't burn, Pét'a.

698
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:53,475
I've heard that you killed
a man. Is it true?

699
01:20:55,977 --> 01:21:05,612
It happened a long time ago.
I took a part in an operation.

700
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:08,573
- Against who?
- Against a spy.

701
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:13,328
There isn't much to tell.

702
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:19,834
We got an order to eliminate
a saboteur on a motorbike...

703
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:31,513
- Let's not write any more ads.
- Okay, we won't.

704
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,433
We can manage by ourselves.
I'll work.

705
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:39,521
Come on...

706
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,750
This is...

707
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:14,722
Jindřiška, do you know where
I put my teeth last night?

708
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:17,058
In a glass in the bathroom.

709
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:34,159
As a girl a long time ago

710
01:22:36,244 --> 01:22:43,626
The boys and
I climbed in trees

711
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:49,841
And when they broke
the branches

712
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:55,346
They put cherries
down my blouse

713
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:01,936
When they got too curious
what was under there

714
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:07,192
I shooed them away
with a green branch

715
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:18,620
I more or less
protected myself

716
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:27,962
Nobody could touch
my cherries

717
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:34,135
Don't ever trust
the boys you like

718
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,224
They'd all steal the cherries
from your pie

719
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:46,272
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

720
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:58,243
Before we get
to the children's grades

721
01:23:58,326 --> 01:24:03,248
I'm obliged to inform you about
one very unpleasant thing.

722
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:07,794
There is a bad habit
spreading here.

723
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:12,757
The children use
cuss words too often.

724
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:16,135
Especially one of them.

725
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,429
That word is...

726
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,351
FUCK

727
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,651
- Where did they learn it?
- Not from us.

728
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:34,445
- Do they all say it?
- All of them.

729
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:40,159
Even Šebková.

730
01:24:42,036 --> 01:24:44,497
- That's terrible.
- Come in.

731
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:49,752
Hello. I'm sorry
to interrupt you...

732
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:55,091
I'm running around
but I can't find my way.

733
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:59,387
You know my wife used
to take care of the PTA.

734
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:06,019
Where is the high school glass...
I mean high school classrooms.

735
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:09,230
It's one floor up, Mr. Kraus.

736
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,233
I mean down.

737
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:16,779
You're on the wrong floor.

738
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:19,115
I'm sorry.

739
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:33,004
- Looking for somebody, comrade?
- What?

740
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,150
- Mr. Kraus!
- I'm sorry.

741
01:25:54,275 --> 01:25:58,571
- Are you okay?
- It's fine. I just felt dizzy.

742
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:03,576
- You don't look good.
- You look terrible too.

743
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:07,872
I'm sorry. You're so pale.

744
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:10,583
I always look like this at
the end of the school year.

745
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:19,008
Did you find the class?

746
01:26:21,928 --> 01:26:23,888
No, I didn't.

747
01:26:28,476 --> 01:26:34,023
I've never even thought I'd be
so incompetent without a woman.

748
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:37,318
But Jindřiška is almost
a grown woman.

749
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:45,910
- I've always wanted a son.
- I'll lend you mine sometimes.

750
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:48,663
Thank you. I'm home.

751
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:51,874
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

752
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:57,088
- What is the medal for?
- For bravery.

753
01:26:59,549 --> 01:27:02,385
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

754
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:24,574
Hello? Dad?

755
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:32,707
Fine. You want me to come
to see you in Washington? When?

756
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:42,967
Life is only luck

757
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:47,597
Today you're up,
tomorrow down

758
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:56,230
And then life flows on
to the sea of death to drown

759
01:27:56,981 --> 01:28:01,444
All drift along to the sea

760
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:05,948
Some today and some tomorrow

761
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:14,248
And if you find love
don't waste it on sorrow

762
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:20,963
What are you running for?
You'll wear me out.

763
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:26,636
I can't go there panting like
this. Let's go see your aunt.

764
01:28:26,761 --> 01:28:29,055
- No way.
- Go ahead.

765
01:28:33,059 --> 01:28:36,813
Aunt Eva is coming, but
she's not coming to see us.

766
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:43,861
Do you think
she takes him seriously?

767
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:47,240
I think it's a done deal.

768
01:28:48,449 --> 01:28:51,953
You seem
as if it was today's headline.

769
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:57,166
- You can't do anything about it.
- Why would I change anything?

770
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:01,963
She's gonna ruin her life
with that choleric.

771
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:09,679
I know she's a teacher but
she is completely unteachable!

772
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,893
Do you want me to put tomato
sauce there for tomorrow?

773
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:27,405
Go open the door, please.

774
01:29:32,451 --> 01:29:36,539
- Hello.
- Hello, professor. Hi scout.

775
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:40,376
- Come in. Take your thing off.
- Aren't we here too early?

776
01:29:40,543 --> 01:29:44,213
- Not at all.
- Pét'a couldn't wait.

777
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:45,965
Look what I brought you.

778
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:53,472
This is beautiful!

779
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:56,058
- Hi Jindřiška!
- Hello.

780
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:57,393
What are you making?

781
01:29:59,645 --> 01:30:03,149
- Gnocchi?
- I tried making dumplings.

782
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:05,067
- They're overcooked.
- Yeah.

783
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:08,279
Let me help you. It happens.

784
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:15,870
This has Burian's pictures in it.
You can meet Zdeněk Burian.

785
01:30:16,037 --> 01:30:17,914
He's my friend.

786
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,085
- Pét'a's so wrapped up with him.
- Me too.

787
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:28,090
- I've always wanted a daughter.
- Dad has always wanted a son.

788
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:29,842
- Can I taste it?
- Sure.

789
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:31,427
It looks good.

790
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:37,934
It's delicious!
Did you make it by yourself?

791
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:39,936
It's my mom's recipe.

792
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:43,856
Why is she there for so long?

793
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,737
Eva isn't eighteen.

794
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:57,870
She may know what she's doing.
I'm happy she'll live here.

795
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,830
He alone is enough for me!

796
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:04,460
- This is not right, is it?
- It's good.

797
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:11,133
- You meant the sauce?
- It's delicious!

798
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:20,851
I eat everything.
Jail taught me a lesson.

799
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:28,234
You have no idea...
but this is delicious!

800
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:33,155
It's great, isn't it Pét'a?
Say something.

801
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,743
The dumplings remind me
of the eggs of Chelonia Mydas.

802
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,831
- Whose eggs?
- Sea turtle's.

803
01:31:52,883 --> 01:31:55,553
- Dad?
- Yeah.

804
01:31:55,678 --> 01:31:57,555
Can I go to the movies?

805
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:02,685
You are staying at home so you
don't get into any trouble.

806
01:32:02,852 --> 01:32:04,729
I have summer vacation.

807
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:08,149
You have nothing to do?

808
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:11,610
I have a date with Jindra.

809
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:16,407
Then go ahead,
go out with your cousin.

810
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:33,591
This is professor Masaryk,
our president and liberator.

811
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:36,552
Soon you'll be studying
about him again.

812
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:44,977
I'm an optimist.
The West is supporting us.

813
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:50,024
At least this is what
my brother says. He's in London.

814
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:57,031
We give the Bolsheviks
one year. Two at the most.

815
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,325
Excuse me!

816
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:06,040
- Hello!
- Hello!

817
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:10,878
- Is Jindra home?
- No. She's with her boyfriend.

818
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:14,298
I see. Thank you.

819
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:15,925
Bye.

820
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:27,812
You're looking forward to it,
aren't you?

821
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:39,031
- It's just for a year.
- What do you mean?

822
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:42,451
Come on.

823
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:22,324
Jindra!

824
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:30,499
- Hi.
- Hi.

825
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,960
- Is Jindra with you?
- No.

826
01:34:33,878 --> 01:34:37,882
- Then say hello to her.
- She's not here.

827
01:35:32,311 --> 01:35:35,981
- Promise me you'll come back.
- I won't be gone forever.

828
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,650
It was beautiful.

829
01:35:43,197 --> 01:35:45,574
- Hi!
- Hi.

830
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:47,493
I was looking for you.

831
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:50,913
Elien's going to see his parents
so I wanted to say good bye.

832
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,209
- Really?
- Bye. Good night.

833
01:35:55,376 --> 01:35:56,627
G'night.

834
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,465
- How long are you going for?
- I don't know yet.

835
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,638
Bye.

836
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:42,923
Come on. Elien will be back
in a year, right?

837
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:49,847
Meanwhile you and I could
go out. Just the two of us.

838
01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:53,892
- We could.
- You think so too?

839
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:58,105
- We are almost family.
- That's right.

840
01:36:58,856 --> 01:37:03,485
I can go with you anywhere,
Michal

841
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:07,323
since we are practically
brother and sister.

842
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:13,579
Because it's obvious that there
are things among siblings which

843
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:15,998
are totally out of the question.

844
01:37:52,493 --> 01:38:00,084
- Are you gonna have more kids?
- Come on, Vašek.

845
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:05,214
Kids, come get some finger food!

846
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,384
- Be careful, Pét'a.
- Sure.

847
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,927
Offer some to everybody.

848
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:17,518
- Maruš?
- Yeah...

849
01:38:18,394 --> 01:38:20,521
London came through.

850
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:30,739
Eva, that's great.
I have goose bumps!

851
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:35,661
- That's what I call a honeymoon.
- Isn't that great?

852
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:41,667
Gentlemen, I read an article
in "Foreigner Curiosities"

853
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:49,174
that an average woman thinks
about sex every five minutes.

854
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:52,803
An average human,
I mean a man

855
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:55,889
thinks about it
every seven minutes.

856
01:38:57,599 --> 01:39:03,063
- What's the point of the story?
- That I'm an average woman.

857
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:07,109
In that case I'm a woman too.

858
01:39:07,234 --> 01:39:13,073
Gentlemen, I had a patient who
was not yet as old as Jindřich

859
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:15,325
and he didn't have
a heart condition.

860
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:20,747
Even the age difference
wasn't as big as yours.

861
01:39:20,873 --> 01:39:24,918
Guess what? That man expired
during their wedding night.

862
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:30,007
Professor, stop painting
the devil on the wall.

863
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:32,259
That's reality.

864
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:40,434
I'd like to show you
the results of my yearly work.

865
01:39:40,559 --> 01:39:45,105
Actually it was
more my brother's idea.

866
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:49,401
As you know he lives in London,
and we still write each other.

867
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:55,491
My brother, captain Otakar Kraus,
flew for Royal British Airforce.

868
01:39:55,657 --> 01:40:00,370
During the war he shot down
five enemy fighter planes.

869
01:40:00,496 --> 01:40:06,084
While the biggest tyrants
and mass murderers

870
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:11,089
have giant monuments here,

871
01:40:11,924 --> 01:40:15,844
Czech pilots don't have even
a tiny memorial in Prague,

872
01:40:16,011 --> 01:40:21,767
but it seems that after a long
period of rule by crude vermin,

873
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:26,188
even those in the highest places
are coming to their senses.

874
01:40:26,355 --> 01:40:29,858
Hopefully an advantageous time
for our plan is arriving.

875
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:38,242
My brother and I decided to use
the lonesome pedestal on Letná,

876
01:40:38,367 --> 01:40:41,411
which is standing there
for absolutely no reason.

877
01:40:41,578 --> 01:40:46,041
To make a long story short,
following my brothers directions

878
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:50,754
I built
something like a small model.

879
01:40:59,263 --> 01:41:00,639
Back then.

880
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:05,394
And now.

881
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:11,650
Don't pay any attention to this.
As you know I wanted a son but...

882
01:41:13,569 --> 01:41:17,155
This is supposed
to be my brother.

883
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:22,995
This is pilot Fajtl. We haven't
made up our minds yet...

884
01:41:26,123 --> 01:41:31,003
Well, compare the difference.

885
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:04,995
Just to take off, huh?

886
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:10,375
It must have been
a hell of a lot of work,

887
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,920
and it's such a silly thing,
right?

888
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:28,143
Don't just sit here like a lump.
Go have fun with the others.

889
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:33,273
You can't be tucked in here
like this.

890
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,743
Fresh coffee is coming.

891
01:42:46,078 --> 01:42:49,998
- Did you give them the spoons?
- Not yet.

892
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:54,419
- What spoons?
- Our wedding present.

893
01:42:54,753 --> 01:42:57,923
- Come on, bro!
- It's not the right time now.

894
01:42:58,090 --> 01:43:00,384
Why not? This is the right time.

895
01:43:00,509 --> 01:43:03,136
Why wouldn't this be
the right time for our present?

896
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,848
- Which one is it?
- That one over there but...

897
01:43:09,017 --> 01:43:10,811
Let them open it themselves.

898
01:43:16,066 --> 01:43:18,110
Well, Eva, open it!

899
01:43:32,541 --> 01:43:36,920
- What is it?
- Teaspoons.

900
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:43,468
A lot of teaspoons
are always useful.

901
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:50,308
Watch out! They are not
just any old teaspoons.

902
01:43:50,726 --> 01:44:00,725
They are plastic teaspoons.
Light, flexible and pliable.

903
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,739
Here you go, professor.

904
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:10,328
You see, these teaspoons were
developed in socialist Germany.

905
01:44:43,987 --> 01:44:51,203
I told you to save them.
They weren't made for hot coffee.

906
01:45:02,589 --> 01:45:09,971
I wonder where our German
comrades made their mistake.

907
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,266
There were shooting
in the air during the war.

908
01:45:16,812 --> 01:45:21,525
You two were made
for each other, right?

909
01:45:22,859 --> 01:45:27,322
Anything not from the USA
isn't good enough for you.

910
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:36,581
If I put two identical
matchboxes in front of you...

911
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:42,003
and I said one was American,
which one would be better, huh?

912
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,673
The American one, of course.

913
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,426
- Of course, the American one.
- Of course, the American one.

914
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:55,016
You're like my son. He brags
about America, about jeans...

915
01:45:55,183 --> 01:46:00,564
Why doesn't he get his hair cut
like an American astronaut?

916
01:46:00,689 --> 01:46:02,649
Where's that bastard anyway?

917
01:46:24,337 --> 01:46:30,510
Nirvana, Olympia
And Heaven don't exist

918
01:46:31,303 --> 01:46:37,642
If someone rags on the world
I just get pissed

919
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:44,733
I don't care about
The infinite universe

920
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:51,239
I'm fine with
A few great years on Earth

921
01:46:51,364 --> 01:47:01,363
Heaven on earth exists you see
I speak the truth, believe me

922
01:47:04,377 --> 01:47:10,050
For life I'd give mine if I must
but I don't wanna bite the dust

923
01:47:10,175 --> 01:47:15,513
I'm not alone, believe me

924
01:47:15,639 --> 01:47:21,478
There are beautiful things
for those who want to live

925
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:27,275
Heaven's beauty depends on you

926
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:33,156
When the time comes
You'll know what to do

927
01:47:33,281 --> 01:47:36,284
When heaven on earth
Starts for you and me...

928
01:47:36,409 --> 01:47:39,496
- Are you looking for something?
- Where are the tablecloths?

929
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:04,938
Go get Michal to put you
in bed at home, okay?

930
01:48:21,955 --> 01:48:26,334
- Mom! My brother's dead!
- What are you talking about?

931
01:48:26,459 --> 01:48:33,341
- He has his head in the oven.
- In our electrical oven?

932
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:39,931
Michal!

933
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:49,399
Calm down. Let me see.

934
01:48:50,984 --> 01:48:56,114
It won't be bad, but I'll take
him to the hospital to make sure.

935
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,369
Jindřiška!

936
01:49:10,253 --> 01:49:13,131
- Dad!
- Bohouš!

937
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:19,471
What did the doctor say?

938
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:24,350
It's just as well.

939
01:49:27,312 --> 01:49:31,441
I'm fine. I just collapsed.
It's not a big deal...

940
01:49:33,276 --> 01:49:35,278
Let's go home.

941
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:43,578
How is he?

942
01:49:46,289 --> 01:49:48,833
- Well?
- He has heatstroke.

943
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:57,258
It's so stupid to try poisoning
yourself in an electrical oven.

944
01:49:57,383 --> 01:49:58,843
Sorry.

945
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:04,974
To tell the true,
he started to smell good.

946
01:50:12,816 --> 01:50:14,234
Eva...

947
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,903
Vašek...

948
01:50:17,654 --> 01:50:19,364
Bro...

949
01:50:23,993 --> 01:50:25,787
Attention...

950
01:50:43,763 --> 01:50:47,600
Marshall Malinovsky.

951
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:18,548
I read you.

952
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,260
What?

953
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:24,804
Let me give you my grandmother.

954
01:51:27,432 --> 01:51:30,351
What's wrong?

955
01:51:35,523 --> 01:51:39,360
- I can hear it.
- Who is it?

956
01:51:39,485 --> 01:51:42,822
- It just woke me up.
- Is anything wrong with Michal?

957
01:51:49,245 --> 01:51:54,375
Dad! The Russians are here!

958
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,294
- What?
- What?

959
01:51:57,545 --> 01:52:02,425
Tell them we'll be right there.
Tell them to wait for us.

960
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:07,096
- What?
- Boris? That dumb ass.

961
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:11,559
Turn on the radio!

962
01:53:41,024 --> 01:53:50,283
You studied Russian. How do you
say bastards in Russian?

963
01:53:50,575 --> 01:53:52,285
Duraki.

964
01:53:53,411 --> 01:54:03,212
Yesterday,
on August 20th, 1968

965
01:54:03,338 --> 01:54:11,304
the armies of the Soviet Union,
Poland. Germany, Hungary

966
01:54:11,429 --> 01:54:17,769
and Bulgaria crossed
the Czechoslovak borders.

967
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:25,443
When I came back
everything was different.

968
01:54:41,793 --> 01:54:43,169
Brother!

969
01:54:46,422 --> 01:54:48,007
Are you nuts?

970
01:54:58,768 --> 01:55:00,603
What?

971
01:55:02,772 --> 01:55:07,819
Dad's whole world fell apart.
He took it as total betrayal.

972
01:55:07,985 --> 01:55:09,487
But some got promoted.

973
01:55:09,612 --> 01:55:12,949
Comrade principal!
I'm looking for classroom 4B.

974
01:55:19,372 --> 01:55:21,499
It wasn't just Elien
who didn't return.

975
01:55:21,666 --> 01:55:24,293
Mom has never seen
Aunt Eva again.

976
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:27,797
The honeymoon
was extended for twenty years.

977
01:58:11,419 --> 01:58:15,756
This film is dedicated
to everyone

978
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:21,971
whose friends, lovers,
parents and children

979
01:58:22,138 --> 01:58:29,103
disappeared overnight
as you remainded here alone.
