Good morning.
- Good morning... Hi... Good morning

16
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,596
Where´re you off to, Blazenka?

17
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,671
l want to show the girls...

18
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,035
Do show us too!

19
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,038
My wedding invitations,
my Mum said to deliver them.

20
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,118
Mm... Mm...
- That´s up-side-down.

21
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,471
Mm, Mm. Yea, yea....

22
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,518
l can´t see a thing,
l sat on my glasses.

23
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,511
When is it to be?
- Soon, the Saturday after next.

24
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,913
Sure,
it´s knocking on your belly-button!

25
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,118
Great fun, this.

26
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,833
Hello!
- Ciao.

27
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,918
May l?

28
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,152
Thanks.
All the best.

29
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,917
Thanks.

30
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,433
They smiled at each other,

31
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,916
did you see?
- But if looks could kill...

32
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,836
Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,996
You got one too?

34
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,588
Very nice, all gold.

35
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,433
Pity l can´t see.

36
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,835
How much did it cost?

37
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,077
l wouldn´t know.
No shot-gun wedding for me.

38
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,920
No, but she had two abortions,

39
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,311
the slut.

40
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,996
Don´t stare at me!

41
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,037
Now then be good, Mum!

42
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,435
Don´t keep making me mad!

43
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,630
For how long will l be held up here
like this?

44
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,513
Come on up at once!
- No!

45
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,074
The Doctor´ll get angry.
- No. lt does not matter...

46
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,716
Just let him get angry!
He´ll go away and that´s that!

47
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,997
Let him go, so what.

48
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,313
No one asked him.

49
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,994
He can take his own filthy medicine.
- Just try to pour it away...!

50
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,118
They´d do me in,

51
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,994
with such poisons!

52
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,877
Such horrible stuff!

53
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,190
She has poured it out... Of course!

54
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
This filthy, disgusting staff! My God...

55
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,438
You dare try that on me!

56
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,630
And you too with the filth!

57
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,718
The bastards all guzzle beer

58
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,118
and make me drink this!

59
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,791
l know why you go mad like this!

60
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,791
l bet the kids´ve brought you beer

61
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,916
and you´re drunk!

62
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,838
Drunk - from what?
You don´t give me food or drink -

63
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,916
more often than not.

64
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,996
Shame on you, Mum,

65
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,118
saying we don´t feed you!
- lt´s true!

66
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,590
Don´t pretend,

67
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,035
l´m an old woman

68
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,711
you need to get rid of me,
so you feed me on filth!

69
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,599
Come on, just,
just keep your mouth shut, mummy.

70
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,716
We give you the choice bits,

71
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,756
how can you say such things?!

72
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,990
Well, but it is true!
Like the soup today,

73
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,038
disgusting, gone off it was.

74
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,071
lt was sour-cream soup!

75
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,276
lt was supposed to be sour!

76
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,511
Say
what you want next time!

77
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,671
lt was horrible muck.

78
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,076
But you ate it all!

79
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,118
Can you hear this, doctor?
- You never give me schnitzel!

80
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,999
You´ve got no teeth to chew it with!

81
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,680
l haven´t, l haven´t... Well, l have.

82
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,433
My teeth are in the side-board drawer.

83
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,028
They´ve been there for 15 years!

84
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,435
So how would you chew?

85
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,438
Make some goulash, then.

86
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,518
You know it gives you diarrhoea!

87
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,996
She always shits her bed afterwards.

88
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,071
Please stop it! Not in front of this.

89
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,071
l know what´s behind it...
- And what?

90
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,118
Your old man´s the same.

91
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,994
Meaning what?

92
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,435
l know he isn´t worth a shit
but he´s my husband!

93
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,835
A drunkard, and so are you!

94
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,996
How dare you, me and drunk?
- Yea, yea, yea!

95
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,036
You´re the one who gets tipsy.
- You too.

96
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,071
Shame on you,

97
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,071
in front of the Doctor.

98
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,754
Dear God, l don´t deserve

99
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
such a daughter!

100
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,518
You´ve got what you made
so don´t complain!

101
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,999
Swallow this and shut up!

102
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,116
Why fight, l always win.

103
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,518
Just you dare spit it out!

104
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,438
She does it all the time.

105
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,233
l´m more of an animal-tamer
than loving daughter!

106
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,999
All this screaming,
the neighbours´ll think

107
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,116
we beat you!

108
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,435
They want to get rid of me...

109
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
l´d rather go to the old peoples home
than this here.

110
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,828
What do l have here? Real purgatory.
- Well, granny...

111
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,520
Now then, today l´ll give you

112
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,990
a better-tasting medicine!

113
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,594
You´ll be up on the wedding-day!

114
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,513
You and your shitty medicines!

115
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,433
l told you not to talk that way

116
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,438
and damm it all
you keep swearing!

117
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,836
Why don´t you feel ashamed?!
So old you could

118
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,871
to know better.
- l will not.

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,633
We do our best for you!

120
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,035
And what do you do?

121
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,435
lf l did not tidy your scarf up
you´d disappear in there!

122
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,516
She has finished her rampage.
l´ll have peace for minute.

123
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,710
the wedding-cakes,
Blaza´s made some already, Doctor.

124
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,995
Come along.

125
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,118
We´re so busy and this...

126
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,435
Good morning.
- Good morning.

127
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,438
Here´s the wedding-invitation,

128
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,074
all gold,
isn´t it lovely?!

129
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,230
lt cost a mint!

130
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,430
ls that supposed to be a ´´K´´?!

131
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,835
Leave me alone!

132
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,599
That´s a fine ´´K´´,
if you saw mine...

133
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,671
You´re educated, Doctor,

134
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,440
the chemist can read your handwriting,
but this?

135
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,518
He can´t even write the addresses!

136
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,318
Christ, Bavorov with a small ´´b´´ !

137
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,234
Put it down, you idiot.

138
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,396
All you´re good at is guzzling beer!

139
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,471
Where´s the beautiful bride?

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,518
She´s delivering the invitations.

141
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,433
This is the real stuff, from Moravia.

142
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,518
Well, doctor...
But Mrs Skopkova, l don´t drink.

143
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,990
This isn´t drink, Doctor.

144
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,116
This is medicine!

145
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,316
Just sniff!

146
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,438
You must drink Blazenka´s health!

147
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,433
You´ve had enough.
Here.

148
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,518
Don´t hesitate,

149
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,830
drink up!

150
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,076
Well then to Blazenka.

151
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,118
And bottoms up!

152
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,718
Ouch, it burns!
Now down the other leg!

153
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,479
Pity she´s out,

154
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,875
l brought her something.

155
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,030
How beautiful!

156
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,118
What a waste,
the garden´s full of flowers!

157
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,518
An orchid, look!

158
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,196
Blazena doesn´t deserve it.

159
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,316
Do not say that, Mrs. Skopkova.

160
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,630
lf l found such a girl,
l´d cherish her!

161
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,718
l know.

162
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,118
Where´re you off to now?

163
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,838
l´m working like an idiot,
- And why?

164
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,918
everyone´s down by the river...

165
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,635
lt won´t ...
- Hurry up!

166
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,228
lt won´t kill you.

167
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,511
Let´s go.
- Well.

168
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,433
lt won´t kill you.

169
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,518
Venca!

170
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,438
What´s up?!

171
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,630
The invitations!

172
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,069
Come and look at them!

173
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,118
Okay.
At ease, Joseph.

174
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,628
Great, aren´t they?
- Mmmm.

175
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,671
Such pretty turtle-doves!

176
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,637
They give me ideas.

177
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,918
Stop it, Joseph´s here.

178
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,635
He´ll turn round.

179
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,718
Stop it!

180
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,918
Look, he´s watching!

181
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,118
All right then...

182
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,918
Holy Elijah!
Crikey!

183
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,918
Away, impure thoughts.

184
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,918
Christ, what is it?

185
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,518
Apage, can you hear me?

186
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,118
Help!

187
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,430
Sodom and Gomorrah.

188
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,518
Christ´s foot forwards!

189
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,118
Let him leave me! Let him leave me!

190
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,318
But l suppose
they may, now.

191
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,918
Let´s go home.

192
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,518
Mother of God...

193
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,718
Dear old man, are you hurt?

194
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,318
An angel. A real angel!

195
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,918
Look where you´re going, old fool!

196
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,628
Look, it´s scratched.

197
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,513
Fuck it all!

198
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,598
Don´t ride bikes if you´re clumsy!

199
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,999
Be glad l didn´t flatten you out!

200
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,118
So - are you okay?

201
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,196
Okay.

202
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,318
Let me help you.

203
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,993
That´s all right, just mud.

204
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,118
Take it easy!

205
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,999
Very much.

206
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,118
l´ll show you!

207
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,518
Let´s go, girls!

208
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,071
l´ll drive you to the village.

209
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,993
lt´s only a few steps.

210
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,993
Come on, climb in.

211
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,118
Wait!
- Let´s go!

212
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,518
My brolly.

213
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,118
Virgin Mary, see this?

214
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,118
Your brolly and let´s go.

215
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,718
God will repay.
- Yeah.

216
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,918
And my basket.

217
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,918
My bicycle!

218
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,830
Well, isn´t he crazy...

219
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,918
Wasn´t that the priest?
- ln whose car?

220
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,671
Okay.

221
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,433
Let´s go girls.

222
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,438
What happened, Father?

223
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,520
You look a sight, Father!

224
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,830
lsn´t it horrible?
- Who was it?

225
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,428
A face like an angel

226
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,518
words tender and gentle

227
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,993
as she dusted my cassock

228
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,118
with a fragrant hand.

229
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,718
Some nightmare.

230
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,435
Mrs. Teacher!

231
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,518
Hello!

232
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,435
What are you doing here?

233
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,471
l knocked down some old geezer,

234
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,471
his bike scratched my car.

235
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,438
And such a lovely car!

236
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,518
Our old sinner Otto the priest.
ls he agonner?

237
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,033
A couple of bruises.
l need some coffee

238
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,118
quick!
- Sure, come in.

239
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,035
Two small lemonades.

240
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,628
You bought some in the shop!

241
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,718
But these are yellow.

242
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,118
Who´s that?

243
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,828
A woman engineer from Prague.

244
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,633
She´s on her way to Vienna.

245
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,718
To Vienna?
Open one for me!

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,718
How does Miluna know her?

247
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,278
Turn the radio off,
l can´t hear.

248
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,518
Her name´s Wendy.

249
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,518
lsn´t she the image of her Dad?

250
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,193
You´ve knocked the breath out of me.

251
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,318
He´s nothing much.

252
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,318
But she´s got your beauty.

253
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,118
You always were special.

254
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,118
Good old Strakonice days.

255
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,428
Hubby left me the car

256
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,518
and some money.
But that´s it.

257
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,994
The hell of a work!

258
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,071
Where can l find him?

259
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,116
Somewhere round the farm.

260
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,270
But probably in the office now.

261
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,430
Good morning.
- Goodbye.

262
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,518
Bye.
- l´ll be back.

263
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,318
Hi.
- Look what l´ve done.

264
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,594
Pretty, isn´t it?
- Show me!

265
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,671
Well, look.

266
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,035
But there should be a poem.

267
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,435
Beda and me,

268
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,676
we´ll have:

269
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,035
Go with him
who loves you.

270
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,071
That´s nice.

271
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,276
D´you know
what the idiot told me?

272
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,430
That he´d be run off his feet!

273
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,518
Maybe there´s something in it,
look.

274
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,118
Who´s that?
- l don´t know.

275
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,118
Let me!

276
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,119
You wrote
that you´d parted!

277
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,310
That you´ll take us home.

278
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,356
Bigmouth!

279
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,396
Yes, but ...
- Well?

280
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,511
lt didn´t work out.
What?

281
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,556
She´s so sensitive.

282
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,108
l see. Sensitive?
Whilst your child isn´t.

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,510
You betrayed us once before.
- So l betrayed you?!

284
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,596
So l have betrayed? You say?

285
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,910
You married that rich old fart!

286
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,951
l wasn´t good enough.

287
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,474
A mere farmer.

288
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,591
That´s her, let´s move!

289
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,830
This is stupid, here, like this...
- What taste you have now.

290
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,110
But l´d like to meet her.

291
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,196
You have got mad...

292
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,390
Hello, Miss Eva!
- Hello.

293
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,112
Good morning.

294
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,116
Give me a couple of days. - But
after than you will marry me, won´t you?

295
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,156
Yes, l´ll tell Eva myself.

296
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,913
With Evik... - Well,
and before you return from Vienna,

297
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,395
l will be free again, and so...
after that... - The poor girl.

298
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,590
On the 18th, then.
- Well, bye.

299
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,870
Do it by then

300
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,951
or else...

301
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,110
This village´ll never have seen such

302
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,913
a scene!

303
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,838
´Bye.

304
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,310
That is a loss.

305
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,313
That´s a face well slapped.

306
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,120
Again.
Who was she?

307
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,310
Don´t go mad!

308
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,358
Confess!

309
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,718
Gaby.
l mean Mrs Feyfar.

310
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,118
Where d´you know her from?

311
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,396
Driving-school.

312
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,556
She taught me,

313
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,835
Venca and Miluna.

314
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,354
What is she to you?

315
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,396
Me? Nothing.

316
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,994
And what´s this?

317
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,116
Well, what...

318
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,509
A friendly kiss.

319
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,433
lt´s normal for friends to kiss.

320
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,518
lt may be normal elsewhere
but not here in Hostice.

321
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,269
How come she knew my name?
- By name?

322
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,590
She called me Miss Eva!

323
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,915
Even knew l´m still single.

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,594
l told her about you,

325
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,433
that we´re going to marry.

326
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,598
And what´s this?
- That´s Wendy!

327
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,439
Mrs Feyfar just hands out

328
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,556
photos of her child?

329
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,910
Gaby ...

330
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,719
l mean Mrs Feyfar!
... left it ...

331
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,593
... for ...

332
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,315
For whom?

333
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,392
For Venca Konopnik.

334
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,313
For him, but with you?!

335
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
He´s getting married
so she couldn´t very well...

336
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,793
She asked me

337
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,878
to give it to him and say
they think of him.

338
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,998
Well, that is all, or is there
anything else? What else?

339
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,118
Christ - poor Blazena!

340
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,513
Why´s the light on?

341
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,108
l keep on about energy conservation...

342
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,708
Hi, Chief.

343
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,519
Where´s everyone?

344
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,598
What´s the matter now?
- Nothing.

345
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,518
´´For Daddy from Wendy´´ - Who is that?

346
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,108
lmagine!

347
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,152
Venca Konopnik has a child with a woman
from Prague.

348
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,313
That´s her, that´s the kid.

349
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,918
She sure is some bird!

350
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,838
Beda, look!

351
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,118
She is a bird, she sure is...

352
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,113
She´s a widow.

353
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,118
When she got pregnant
she married a rich old geezer

354
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,993
and he pegged out.

355
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,118
The kid is really Vencas´s?

356
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,998
But not a word to anyone!

357
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,118
Girls, come quick!

358
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,710
Hey, hey, hey!

359
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,115
Wait for me!

360
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,589
l´ll come last again.

361
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,910
l´ll wait for you there!

362
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,998
Venca?
Nonsense, Mrs Kelisova.

363
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,438
May l go to West Germany

364
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,313
if l´m lying!

365
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,119
Eva said so,

366
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,310
showed me the photo.

367
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,948
With that peroxide hussy

368
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,548
who ran you down.

369
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,989
Poor Blazena.

370
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,230
Venca always was the village bull.

371
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,794
A typical Venca.
l keep saying that.

372
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,956
All this fornication!

373
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,913
This sinful man wants to enter
into marriage.

374
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,676
And there also...

375
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,718
Sodom and Gomorrah.

376
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,118
Do your duty, sisters!

377
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,353
Take your places, girls!

378
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,313
Did she tell you
who´s the father?

379
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,515
l promised not to tell.

380
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,517
You can tell me, come on!

381
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,596
See, tell me. lt is all the same.
- l cannot.

382
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,910
l tell you everything too.
Well, don´t be silly.

383
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,871
But l really can´t!

384
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,714
Beda just told me

385
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,513
the kid is Venca´s.

386
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,118
No!

387
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,994
... lawfully wedded.

388
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,828
Now it´s out, l suppose...

389
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,918
l knew my clown
wasn´t up to it.

390
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,708
Miluna, be my guest.
Well, sorry!

391
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,115
That´s OK.

392
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,118
Be glad.
- Poor Blazena.

393
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,118
You´re right.
- My God, l cannot drink this!

394
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,117
l´m so happy!

395
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,719
What is it, auntie.

396
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,796
Gimme some chewing-gum,

397
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,916
l´ll go.

398
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,428
What?

399
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,912
What child?

400
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,310
What are you gabbing about?

401
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,074
lf l´m gabbing...

402
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,630
Come on!

403
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,513
With a driving-school instructor,

404
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,320
she lives in Prague now.

405
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,318
What?

406
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,711
Miluna can tell you more,
she´s been talking to her.

407
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,674
l don´t believe it.

408
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,428
Hello Marenka!
- Don´t call me Marenka!

409
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,518
They received a double zero.
- Swallow it up, the double zero.

410
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,915
That rascal of yours had
better watch out!

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,434
The shame of it!

412
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,398
They´ll be drawing blood today.

413
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,595
Damn you!

414
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,314
Mrs. Matousova! Again?!

415
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,798
lsn´t it enough for you that
you have been shot down twice already?

416
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,918
A handful of shit again!
She´d have knocked me down.

417
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,914
BBC emergency, this.

418
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,918
Witches´ gathering!
To hell!

419
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,113
Tell me! That child!

420
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,914
The truth or l´ll bash you one!

421
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,918
Don´t shout at me,
ask them that know.

422
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,118
You talked to
that hussy from Prague!

423
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,871
Mrs, Feyfar.

424
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,076
And so what?

425
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,993
What is up?
Whose is that child?

426
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,118
Why don´t you ask
your future son-in-law.

427
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,396
Son-in-law...

428
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,476
She spoke to Beda too,

429
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,471
left a message for Venca.

430
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,471
This is their Wendy.

431
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,114
Dear God!

432
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,993
God in heaven!

433
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,515
She´s the image of him.

434
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,319
Show me!
- Take a look!

435
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
Well, really, it is so.

436
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,078
Christ in heaven!

437
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,119
See you tonight.

438
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,118
Good morning.

439
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,920
Good morning.

440
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,313
What´s wrong?

441
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,994
Tonight, then.

442
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,313
Ciao.

443
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,120
What´s the crowd outside?

444
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,198
Where´ve you been?
- With Venca.

445
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,390
Do you know her?
Sure.

446
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,516
You know her!

447
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,513
Will someone tell me
what happened?

448
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,438
Ask your Mum!

449
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,516
What happened?

450
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,716
Ask dear Venca
what happened!

451
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,916
Let that bull of an ox tell you!

452
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,315
He´s got a bastard with some slut!

453
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,115
What´s a slut, Mum?

454
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,435
You idiot!

455
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,199
Nonsense!
l keep telling you!

456
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,236
Shame on you,

457
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,276
lying to your own mother!

458
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,476
She told Miluna.
Ask in the cooperative.

459
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,518
She came here by car
and looked for him.

460
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,438
She left him a message and photograph!

461
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,516
lt could be you

462
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,636
as a child!
Look at her nose!

463
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,439
Leave me alone!
Little nose...

464
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,476
Dad, tell her she´s daft.

465
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,630
He needn´t tell me anything, me!

466
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,314
lt´s you
he should bash up!

467
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,914
l shan´t outlive the same of it!

468
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,679
Was it not enough?
First with Miluna,

469
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,995
now this.
And now this.

470
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,116
lt´s just gossip,
l´ll ask him.

471
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,913
Don´t you dare go to him!
l would have to break your legs

472
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,508
if you went there again!

473
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,552
Let him come and own up!
- And why own up, tell me?!

474
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,718
l´m telling you,
l had nothing on with her!

475
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,993
l´ll have it out with Beda and Miluna!

476
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,355
Where´re you going!
- To Venca´s!

477
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,829
Back, l tell you, Blazena!

478
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,428
Blazena!
- You´re not going!

479
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,516
Noooo...

480
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,512
Over my dead body!
- Mummy...

481
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,078
Such goings-on.

482
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,158
And you offered to do
a church wedding...

483
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,995
Blaza, please,

484
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,355
it´s just silly gossip!

485
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,398
So whose is the child?
- How would l know?!

486
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,118
His!
And there´s proof!

487
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,916
You can´t go by a photo,

488
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,958
and Venca swears!
- Swears, yeah...

489
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,310
You´re staying in!

490
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,550
Don´t make such a scene...

491
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,915
What scene?...
- The whole village´s watching!

492
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,720
Let them see

493
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,268
what´s going on,
better than on television!

494
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,198
And that´s that.

495
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,598
She´s doing this on purpose,
a week before the wedding.

496
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,916
What´s she doing on purpose?

497
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,434
l´m defending the family honour

498
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,795
against that ... that ...
l hate saying what!

499
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,189
Now just say it, say it!

500
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,436
Who knows the whole truth.

501
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,875
Maybe you only needed my Venca
to save the girl´s honour!

502
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,916
Shut up, will you?!

503
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,116
Of course!
Who knows,

504
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,515
the kid could be anyone´s!

505
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,552
lt stinks to high heaven,
all these men around!

506
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,513
What did you say?

507
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,556
l can smell blood, Father.

508
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,438
Help me up, girls!

509
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,120
´t would be small wonder!

510
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,435
That engineer you buttered up,

511
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,915
pushing the girl into his bed!

512
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,713
What?!
- Just ignore her, woman.

513
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,918
l´ll kill her!
She´d say this about my girl?

514
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,913
l´m not scared of you!

515
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,315
Smell my fist!

516
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,318
Hold me back! Where are you?

517
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,108
Or l´ll make her mug uglier still!

518
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,310
Look at her getting an attack!

519
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,516
lsn´t she a crazy Marianne?

520
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,433
l bet l hit on it, it´s true!

521
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,074
Lovely!

522
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,878
Hold me, girls!

523
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,518
Leave her alone,
or you´ll be ill.

524
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,315
Let me go!
- Calm down,

525
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,398
your heart´ll act up!

526
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,998
l can´t stand this!
Ever ready, Father.

527
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,116
Let me go!

528
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,919
Don´t let her provoke you!

529
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,118
Bloody filth.

530
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,508
Mum!

531
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,676
Let him marry

532
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,830
his Prague slut!

533
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,798
Venca´s no catch for you, Blazena.

534
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,310
Blaza!

535
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,273
Don´t demean yourself, son!
You´ll be paying alimony anyway!

536
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,709
No alimony!

537
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,798
Who knows who´s the father!

538
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,915
Mummy, please!

539
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
That widow from Prague´s better!

540
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,678
A nice car, bags of money...

541
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,593
We´ll build an extension at last!

542
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,993
lf you build an extension,

543
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,913
we´ll add a whole floor!

544
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,998
And we´ll tile the front!

545
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,838
And find a better match

546
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,918
for Blazena!

547
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,118
You won´t become Mrs Konopnik!

548
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,518
You gave me a fright.

549
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,718
How did all this come about?!

550
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,513
What? What do you mean?

551
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,513
You mean ... her?

552
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,518
We had coffee...

553
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,718
What did she say?

554
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,710
What she said...
She said to be in Prague now.

555
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,070
And that her man died, or so.

556
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,116
That she earns good money...

557
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,310
And the child?

558
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,119
Wendy´s her name?

559
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,755
l´d never have thought

560
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,115
you and she...

561
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,316
Do not start the same, you...

562
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,635
lt´s like a put-up job!

563
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,109
Excuse me, but...

564
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,993
Excuse me.

565
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,072
lf l had her here l´d...

566
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,839
She´s gone to Vienna

567
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,918
for 10 days.
- Ten days...

568
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,508
So you and she

569
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,591
really didn´t...?

570
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,433
She laid just anyone.

571
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,835
You know her, don´t you
- Do not tell me...

572
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,554
But l didn´t...!

573
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,915
l´d rather hide somewhere!

574
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,190
So it could´ve been anyone´s

575
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,914
and she throws it at you.

576
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,117
But what will you do now?

577
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,196
Blazena won´t have you,

578
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,709
and you will surely not marry her,
will you.

579
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,798
You´d be a fool to.
So what now...?

580
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,515
Leave me alone!

581
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,200
You´re as bad as the priest´s old hags!

582
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,278
l should´ve known
it´s your kid!

583
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,313
What would she want me for?

584
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,908
Just look at me!

585
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,395
Who´d marry me except some...

586
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,313
Some what?

587
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,398
A crazy short-sighted farmhand.

588
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,518
Crazy, short-sighted.

589
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,359
Telling you´s like using a loudspeaker.

590
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,590
A good gossip´s your scene,

591
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,750
instead of cooking a hot meal.

592
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,035
l made hamburgers yesterday!

593
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,953
That´s all you ever make!

594
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,036
lt is healthy.
- Yes, that´s true.

595
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,115
Why get married anyway?

596
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,316
l am asking myself.

597
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,556
l don´t need anything.

598
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,114
You monster.

599
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,515
Of course...
l can´t look Venca

600
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,837
in the eyes now.
l told you not to tell -

601
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,713
but off you go, a - trumpeting.

602
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,638
My reputation now!

603
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,558
lmagine yourself in Blazena´s shoes.

604
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,638
l´d drown, poison and hang myself.

605
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,833
Better and better...

606
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,798
You´d get rid if me.

607
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,798
You see...

608
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,908
You won´t tell Eva,

609
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,429
will you?

610
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,478
There´s nothing to tell. - What do you
mean there is nothing to tell?

611
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,118
D´you mean to say Gaby told you

612
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,118
Venca´s the kid´s a father?

613
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,915
Who else, surely not you?
Surely not you?

614
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,429
That would be the hell of a choice...

615
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,518
Yeah, she told me too
that it was Venca s.

616
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,120
You see.

617
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,919
Any problems?

618
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,395
No.

619
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,713
Turn the light off!

620
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,593
Go to sleep.

621
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,798
He´ll marry the woman from Prague!
To spite them!

622
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,110
Well, well...

623
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,398
Your Blazena can take a running jump!

624
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,713
l can´t sleep.

625
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,400
What a nuissance!

626
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,118
l´ll take another pill.

627
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,878
lt´s so late

628
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,399
and Christ alive, the shame of it.

629
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,199
Shame across the village!

630
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,110
Stop snoring,

631
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,595
l´m thinking!

632
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,756
What am l supposed to do at night?

633
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,798
Do some thinking with me!
- l am thinking.

634
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,798
So l hear!

635
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,318
We´d do best to move away.

636
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,118
The shame of it!

637
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,598
Everybody knows, so what.

638
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,800
Such a pretty little girl.

639
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,593
And the boy says nothing,
fool as he is.

640
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,553
And her mother´s elegant.

641
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,838
l like the looks of her.

642
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,118
Better than Blazena...

643
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,754
l´ll have it out with her.

644
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,838
Me push my girl
into somebody´s bed?!

645
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,118
How can you fool - such a shame!

646
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,718
Ph ... shame!

647
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,998
Our Blazena is going to make
a good match.

648
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,518
l shall to that.

649
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,118
You´ll go green with envy!

650
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,318
You three-coloured engineer... and ...

651
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,518
And that´s that.
l can´t fall asleep.

652
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,718
My home, sweet home...

653
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,120
Send out telegrams:

654
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,708
´´Wedding postponed because of illness´´.

655
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,910
Why go into details.

656
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,713
Hallo, mummy, we are here.

657
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,718
Now then, careful ...

658
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,429
Here´s the list of addresses.

659
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,120
Okay, okay... - And the money, do you
have it? Mind you´re back by lunch -

660
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,118
no loitering about!
- Okay, okay...

661
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,713
Now your feet, Mum.

662
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,434
Our neighbours have stopped existing.

663
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,313
Don´t you dare look that way!

664
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,119
We´ll never talk to them again!

665
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,118
Jirka ll see to you.
Just hold him tight. That s it. Jirka!

666
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,073
No, l´m going with Dad!
- No!

667
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,033
Help me with Gran!
l´ll turn her round to make sure.

668
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,118
Slowly!
- Down, quickly!

669
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,518
Turn ... Feet forwards!

670
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,118
You´re as stupid as your Dad...

671
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,596
Slowly, you rascal!

672
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,718
Me again?!
Some summer holiday!

673
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,835
Don´t kick Gran

674
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,918
or l´ll land you such a slap!

675
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,118
She´s peeping out, that old cow.
- What a bitch!

676
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,398
Here are the addresses
and remember: you write -

677
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,478
´´The wedding is off,
the mother-in-law´s gone mad.´´

678
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,118
Yes, all right.

679
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,316
Such talk...

680
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,472
Gone mad l will!

681
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,518
Stuff it down your throat.

682
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,033
You may need it
for that lady engineer.

683
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,958
We need no trash from you!

684
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,508
And write what you want
into the telegrams!

685
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,518
Such a beautiful pram!
But she will destroy it like this!

686
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,118
l´d rather sit in the dark.

687
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,318
Jesus...

688
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,518
Piss off with your china.

689
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,919
- Jezismarja!

690
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,998
The dirty bastards!

691
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,112
Turn me round!
Come here!

692
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,118
You´re a s heavy as a tank.

693
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,275
Old junk as presents!

694
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,635
lt hardly work!

695
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,955
She´s going to break it!

696
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,998
Watch it yourself!
We have not asked you for that!

697
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,515
And that´s it!

698
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,279
Daddy has given a bribe to
the head of the electrical shop.

699
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,316
We´re buying a colour set anyway!

700
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,398
l´d rather throw it to the pigs!

701
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,718
No! That´s ours!
- Mine!

702
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,076
Ours!

703
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,118
Pull yourselves together, girls!

704
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,358
What is, Father?

705
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,438
Think of the unborn child

706
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,118
and sin no more!

707
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,715
There is nothing to do here
your dignity.

708
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,990
As the mother l refuse

709
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,310
to give my only son
to such people - look at her!

710
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,312
What if she starts beating him?

711
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,438
Your only son can piss off.

712
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,920
The bastard s off with any skirt!

713
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,838
Why should our Blazena

714
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,918
marry such a whore-monger, Father?

715
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,118
What language, dear God...
l heard nothing.

716
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,118
Do not make hasty decisions.

717
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,118
Let the young people talk it out

718
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,193
and make their decision.

719
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,595
There´s nothing to decide.

720
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,399
The wedding´s off!

721
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,432
No, the wedding´s on!
He´s not the only man around.

722
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,518
l shan t let the girl suffer in shame.

723
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,118
l´ll see she makes a good match!

724
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,278
This can´t go on.

725
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,518
This is too much!

726
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,638
This!
How would l explain

727
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,718
when l´m called to make accounts?

728
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,438
lt must be clarified!

729
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,710
And now!

730
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,798
Venca!

731
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,118
l want a word with you!

732
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,118
Help!

733
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,198
God alive, what is it?

734
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,278
What are you doing? Be careful!

735
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,518
Switch me off, for God´s sake!

736
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,118
Take me down!

737
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,198
A miracle, Father!

738
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,318
You´re alight!

739
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,118
Cecily!
Somebody ...! Take me down!

740
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,115
Miracle!

741
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,998
All right?

742
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,118
Hold on, carefully ...

743
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,635
Are you all right?

744
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,593
Thank you, what a fright...

745
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,234
You wanted something?

746
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,749
Make it up with Blazena.

747
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,798
The unborn babe does not deserve
for you to scorn it.

748
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,632
l don´t.
Just leave it to us!

749
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,838
Hold on to me!

750
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,118
Carefully now!
- Ouch!

751
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,758
l´ll make a poultice...

752
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,918
Let´s make it ...
Halloooo!

753
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,277
Hand me that!

754
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,711
Come here!
Hand me that!

755
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,513
Gimme, you little bastard!

756
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,438
Gran!

757
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,520
D you know this?

758
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,833
Something stupid again?

759
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,309
A game, see.

760
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,358
Put it down - and jerk it back.

761
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,518
You have a try.

762
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,118
Put it down, jerk it back.

763
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,118
That´ll be fun!

764
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,838
And now watch me!
That´s mine, you little bastard!

765
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,118
Give it to me, you rascal! My God

766
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,838
they take everything,
the shitty bastards!

767
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,918
l want to show you!

768
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,278
Watch...take a stone
and wrap it into a banknote

769
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,278
wind the thread round it

770
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,278
and throw ...

771
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,718
Then lie in wait
for who falls for it!

772
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,594
l´ll lie in wait!

773
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,678
l´m off with the boys,
you just lie in wait!

774
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,958
Take a stone ...

775
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,438
wrap it up
twist and twist ...

776
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,918
Don´t cry, it´s only gossip.
Here you are.

777
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,718
The things l have to listen to!

778
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,197
Venca didn´t come,
didn´t say a thing.

779
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,920
Give it to me!
l will ...

780
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,958
Maybe your folks didn´t let him.

781
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,599
lt´ll work out all right.

782
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,314
Venca isn´t such a ...

783
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,113
Sure he is!

784
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,198
Everyone´s saying that kid
on the photo´s like him!

785
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,118
l don´t want him!

786
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,198
l´m so unhappy.
- Well, take it easy...

787
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,312
Scram, Joseph!
l must talk to her.

788
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,512
You stay here, Pepa!
No, he can scram, the traitor!

789
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,838
lt really is just gossip,

790
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,599
cross my heart or hope to die!

791
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,678
l don´t believe a word!

792
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,320
When l find out who caused this

793
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,079
l´ll kill him on the spot!

794
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,118
Even if l get a life sentence.

795
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,197
Go away!
l do not even want to see you again!

796
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,916
Why re you screaming?

797
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,713
You heard, Venca, didn´t you?!

798
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,758
Was that meant for me?
- Of course.

799
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,592
The bastard!
You´re quite a man.

800
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,118
You stop howling! Or l will give you
more to have a reason!

801
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,118
Come and have coffee, Joe -

802
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,198
come for a talk this afternoon.

803
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,316
And l wanted to ask you ...

804
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,118
Where´s my car!

805
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,593
That bed´s always in the way.

806
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,120
What ...?

807
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,118
What a fun!

808
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,518
Stupid tricks,

809
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,118
at your age, shame on you!

810
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,718
He fell for it!

811
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,718
Just imagine, her mother

812
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,673
has another suitor

813
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,672
lined up!

814
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,593
Ouch!
- Higher up!

815
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,118
Whom?

816
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,359
Fat Joseph.

817
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,398
Fat... yea, yea, yea. Yea?

818
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,118
What a scandal!

819
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,593
Now gargle, Father.

820
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,678
You can´t keep squeaking like this.

821
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,712
l´m here!

822
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,638
Come in!

823
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,118
Come in, don´t be shy!

824
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,318
The house is Blazena s.

825
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,310
And she also has a garden.

826
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,116
90 thousand in the bank,

827
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,516
all hers...

828
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:12,912
Lumbago, that hurts!

829
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,310
l know that to do!

830
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,990
Mummy, hurry!
Come and have a look!

831
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,594
What is?
- Quickly!

832
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,718
Come and see this!

833
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,513
What on earth?

834
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,115
lt look s like they´re ...

835
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,510
But the other way round ...?

836
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,115
l don´t know this one ...

837
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,113
She won´t want me,

838
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,118
l´m too fat.
- Fat? Where?

839
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,110
Do not worry, Pepi!
Just leave it to me.

840
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,513
How about a drink?

841
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,520
l don´t believe it!

842
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,513
The girls said so.
- My goodness!

843
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,116
Look at that!

844
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,317
You´re going to marry Joseph!
- l´d rather be an unwed mother.

845
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,516
l wouldn´t outlive the shame!

846
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,114
l do not want people pointing at us...

847
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,913
What do you want? Joseph...

848
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,594
Such a decent man,
doesn´t sit at the pub,

849
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,320
he´s got his own flat,

850
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,630
car and video -

851
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,716
what more do you want?

852
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,428
That´s not everything...

853
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,516
You shut up!

854
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,596
Your brain´s bloated with beer!

855
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,676
What did you say?!
- Just the truth!

856
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,910
He´s so fat!
- Of course he is fat,

857
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,917
but nice.

858
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,720
Who´ll have you, pregnant?

859
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,916
So he´s stout,

860
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,719
you get fat types on TV too!

861
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,713
And why? Because they are prosperous.

862
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,110
But l ...

863
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,599
l don´t love him! - She says
she does not love him any more!

864
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,115
You´ll marry him, that´s that!

865
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,318
l can´t even eat in peace!

866
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,113
We have the wedding as planned.

867
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,113
ln the morning you made me
call it all off and now...

868
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,915
And ignore that bastard next door!

869
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,998
His mother brags

870
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,116
about their wonderful bride.

871
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,113
Let them have as many as they want!
You´ll get married too.

872
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,715
But decently!

873
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,513
Not another word!

874
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,718
l want a drink!
Or l´ll peg out!

875
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,520
We are here

876
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,313
to reveal sin,

877
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,114
fight and erase sin.

878
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,918
What?
- We´ve got to erase it.

879
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,715
Because it is written:

880
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,318
Let not the weeds impure

881
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,713
seize the well-kept field

882
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,314
lest it suffocate the useful plants.

883
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,111
Cecily, pour out the grog,
l´ll put a tape on.

884
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,715
The Song of Bernadette.

885
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,916
Stop smacking you lips!

886
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,913
Stop hitting me!
Smack yours too!

887
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,115
But you do not have any, do you?
- You witch...

888
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,118
Fear me not, dear child,

889
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,110
come to me!
Come closer,

890
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,990
lt´s me, you idiot,

891
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,515
down!
Here!

892
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,910
Blazena!

893
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,710
What was that?

894
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,112
l´m not snoring!
l´m not even asleep...

895
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,113
Open up, it´s me!

896
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,120
Don´t be so silly!

897
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,116
Silly, is she?!

898
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,715
Just you try coming again!

899
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,110
Tear him up, Pinda!

900
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,916
Sweet home ...

901
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,116
Chief ...!

902
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,518
Shall l recite a poem for you?

903
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,713
One day in the park

904
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,512
l found a coin, a mark.

905
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,718
Nobody could care less
it was East German, careless!

906
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,518
Shut up, you´ll end up in jail...

907
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,911
And here they come!
So ... check in...

908
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,513
´´This isn´t the barracks; the Co-op.´´

909
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,716
Just a moment.
Television!

910
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,111
Yes, speaking.

911
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,510
Czechoslovak Television.

912
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,716
And so what.

913
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,913
On the 18th.

914
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,110
lt is Saturday comrade.

915
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,318
Saturday is a working-day for us anyway.

916
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,115
The harvest´s on!

917
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,113
We´ll be expecting you.

918
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,518
l´m Radl, the Chief.

919
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,320
Understand? OK.
Saturday morning then, early.

920
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,311
And come as soon as you can!

921
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,516
Bye bye, salute.
- On Friday...

922
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,110
So they will come on the eighteenth.

923
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,033
We´ll be in the news?
- lt´s about the people

924
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,993
who most helped
our victory in the milk league

925
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,720
through the Simon method.

926
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,713
So they won´t take office shots.

927
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,435
You can listen in,

928
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,120
Joseph ll arrange the equipment.

929
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,828
You beast!
Do you happen to know, chairman

930
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,520
we sing that Walkyrie song, and how?!

931
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,308
ln the year sixty six

932
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,313
when peace will be everywhere
and you will be an engineer

933
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,710
and we will be going out together

934
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,116
along the path to Protivin,
which is so short. - What are you doing?

935
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,115
See, l don´t need any equipment.

936
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,713
The best collective?
That´ll be something.

937
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,718
lt´s either the Skopek
or Konopnik woman!

938
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,916
How´ll you decide?!

939
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,110
Heavens above!

940
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,313
LAST DAYS OF POMPEY

941
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,113
No!
- Chairman!

942
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,720
lt´ll be a fiasco!

943
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,118
Which of em works better this week

944
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,318
will be on television!

945
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,115
What do you mean work better?

946
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,114
When they hear,
they´ll jerk off the cows udders!

947
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,713
Television.
Just what we needed...

948
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,315
You two will see

949
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,710
to decorations.

950
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,276
Some banners, greenery ...

951
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,112
... Flowers
- flowers...and

952
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,913
... decorative paper
- and all that stuff.

953
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,994
Sweep the yard properly,

954
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,118
for once!
- Okay... Certainly...

955
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,110
Dear Newsreel ...

956
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,991
This is not possible...

957
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,310
What´s the matter with you women?

958
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,320
An average of hardly 4 litres!

959
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,994
l don´t believe it!
- Just look...

960
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,118
Come here, girl!

961
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,512
ls it playing?

962
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,915
lt is.
- Here too.

963
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,710
So what´s wrong?

964
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,916
And they?

965
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,312
Normal,

966
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,711
even above normal.
- This is strange, this...

967
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,428
We shan t be on TV this way!

968
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,518
We´ll see to it!
- Women, for God´s sake...

969
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,320
Why don´t they milk the cows?
What does that mean?

970
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,115
l´m playing, as usual.

971
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,312
And what are you playing to them,
Joseph? Your tapes -

972
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,991
Heavy Metal, Folk ...

973
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,913
A bit of opera ...
- And what do you play for them?

974
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,720
The same stuff.

975
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,116
Let´s go! Let´s go!

976
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,716
Let´s go, girls!

977
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,720
So whose fault is it?
Come on, girls!

978
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,794
Come on, girls!

979
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,996
Well, well...
- l´m leaving

980
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,310
But comrades, girls, remember...

981
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,716
l refuse to be insulted!

982
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,872
l´m ignoring you.

983
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,508
Just see to your cows.

984
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,711
l do nothing but!

985
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,997
l bet she cast a spell on them!

986
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,720
She´s staring like a bull, the witch!

987
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,718
What?!
- Where´s your common sense?!

988
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,315
What would the TV people think?!

989
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,233
Seeing you rioting like this!
Or the district council people!

990
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,716
l do not mind what they think, chairman.
l am not greedy, as some...

991
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,440
l don´t care about showing off,
like some.

992
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,313
But l won´t have her insult me!

993
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,120
Who is insulting you?!
You´re such a sight,

994
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,510
they wouldn´t put you on TV anyway!
You know...!

995
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,712
Enough that you will be there!
They can take a shot of you all

996
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,997
for a real socialist family -
he ever drunk,

997
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,118
the girl a baggage of shame...

998
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,920
God, this about my girl?!

999
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,311
And who got her that way?!
l´ll show her what for!

1000
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,799
Enough!
Silence!

1001
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,520
Back to work, damn you!

1002
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,718
Back to your position!
- Come on, girls!

1003
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,313
You think he´s up to some trick?

1004
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,915
He´s hand in glove with them.

1005
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,118
Skopkova!
Come on!

1006
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,113
Good evening.
- Good evening.

1007
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,915
But the music was on?
- This is it.

1008
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,116
We couldn´t prove anything.

1009
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,318
By the time they tore in,

1010
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,437
l´d switched it back!

1011
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,669
No.

1012
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,718
The cows who like brass bands

1013
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,520
l gave opera,
- l see.

1014
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,116
the symphony buffs got rock!

1015
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,717
Serves her right.
Watch her on television,

1016
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,638
l´d throw the set out the window!

1017
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,672
Help yourself.

1018
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,111
And Blazena?
- What? Blaza?

1019
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,674
She can´t want me, l´m fat.

1020
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,030
You´re a man!

1021
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,509
Want you or not. Come!

1022
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,598
Blazena?
Are you there?

1023
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,833
Open up at once!

1024
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,918
Quick!
She is not allowed to go out.

1025
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,118
lt´s me, Joseph!

1026
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,878
Quick!

1027
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,798
You dare lock yourself in?!

1028
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,918
Don´t do it again.

1029
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,833
Hi.
- Hi.

1030
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,070
Come on, children...

1031
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,879
Here you are.
- Well, thanks.

1032
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,598
You can´t go through the window...

1033
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,310
My Lord!
- What is up?

1034
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,119
You´re like an excavator!

1035
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,398
See that?

1036
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,518
Come and have a look!

1037
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,120
She locked them in together!

1038
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,919
She´s certainly determined!

1039
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,998
Forget her, dear,

1040
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,072
marry Gaby, she´s educated,

1041
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,038
well-travelled ...
... has a car and pots of money...

1042
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,116
You fool.

1043
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,516
Don´t cry! l´m not mad at you.

1044
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,118
l still love him, l´m stupid.

1045
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,115
Not really.

1046
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,437
You´re great, but l ...

1047
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,516
l know.

1048
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,109
What´ll you tell my Mum?

1049
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,198
That l´m too fat for you!

1050
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,516
Skopkova!

1051
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,558
Forget her, then.

1052
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,911
l wouldn´t mind your having a child.

1053
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,718
l haven´t got a child.

1054
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,917
l never had an affair with Feyfar!

1055
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:09,815
l know that, you´re my tiger.

1056
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:13,368
l didn´t mean her.

1057
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:38,495
The third pump broken.

1058
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:42,134
What a confusion!
Now l can´t stick my face out at all.

1059
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,646
Stop it, you are all shame, confusion...

1060
01:12:44,737 --> 01:12:46,967
l told you he´s too fat for her!

1061
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:49,565
Where´ll l find somebody else?!

1062
01:12:49,697 --> 01:12:52,495
She´ll find her own man
when she wants one.

1063
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,375
Somebody like him again!

1064
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,176
l´m off.
Ciao.

1065
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,375
That´s him all over...

1066
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:04,495
And l have to do the thinking

1067
01:13:04,617 --> 01:13:07,495
and if l did not take care of them

1068
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:10,575
they´d just rot in filth.

1069
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:14,373
They don´t care.

1070
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:23,373
l´m coming.

1071
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:26,415
So how long will l have to wait here?!
Must you make me mad every time?

1072
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:29,650
Climb out immediately!
l know you are there!

1073
01:13:29,777 --> 01:13:32,735
l´m too busy for this.

1074
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:36,175
What´s this - stones?

1075
01:13:37,017 --> 01:13:40,168
That is too much, mummy!
What do you need stones in bed for?

1076
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:48,175
You´ve got your cars,
your Boyo magazines ...

1077
01:13:56,617 --> 01:13:59,689
l´ll give you a spanking, Mum!

1078
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:03,973
l´ll cal the Doctor
to give you a shot!

1079
01:14:04,617 --> 01:14:07,575
The Doctor!

1080
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:10,769
Doctor! Just doctor.

1081
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:19,573
My fairy queen ... my fairy queen ...
Come with me, come with me...

1082
01:14:22,617 --> 01:14:25,893
Eva dear, l must make a call.

1083
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:29,573
lf you want the Doctor,
he´s at old Ma Potuznice s.

1084
01:14:30,017 --> 01:14:32,292
All that way?

1085
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,375
l´ll have to run. Ciao.
- Bye.

1086
01:14:59,617 --> 01:15:02,450
Come in, Doctor!

1087
01:15:02,537 --> 01:15:04,971
Good morning.
- Hello, Jirka.

1088
01:15:05,097 --> 01:15:07,247
What´s this?

1089
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:10,568
He throws darts at her!

1090
01:15:11,697 --> 01:15:13,767
Good Lord, doctor, look.

1091
01:15:13,857 --> 01:15:16,291
if it hit her eye
she´d be blind till her dying day!

1092
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,772
Children have to play.

1093
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:21,974
One cannot leave them alone for a minute
they immediately become mad.

1094
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,492
But l will settle accounts with you.
Mind my word.

1095
01:15:24,617 --> 01:15:27,370
l´ll beat you up when the Doctor´s gone
he´d say it´s unhealthy.

1096
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:30,569
Come in, Doctor!
Do not take off your shoes!

1097
01:15:31,217 --> 01:15:34,573
Make yourself at home...

1098
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:57,650
l´m telling you straight out.

1099
01:15:57,737 --> 01:16:00,376
You know the situation.

1100
01:16:00,497 --> 01:16:03,375
lf you want her, she´s yours.

1101
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:06,529
The wedding can be next Saturday.
- l do not want to believe it...

1102
01:16:06,617 --> 01:16:09,575
Why can´t you believe it?
- When l tell you it is true.

1103
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,972
lt would be too wonderful for me.

1104
01:16:12,097 --> 01:16:14,975
Wonderful?
lt´s only Blazena...

1105
01:16:15,057 --> 01:16:17,571
So - cheers!

1106
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:25,895
You must call me by my fist name now -

1107
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:28,770
l´m Marena, you´re Karel, right?

1108
01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:31,855
Have another.
But l don´t drink!

1109
01:16:32,017 --> 01:16:34,895
But this is to Blaza,
and your great happiness.

1110
01:16:35,017 --> 01:16:37,975
Doctor, Karl, to Marenka
to Blaza, to happiness.

1111
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:49,565
Could she possibly love me?

1112
01:16:49,697 --> 01:16:52,894
She has to!
You have always been her secret wish.

1113
01:16:53,617 --> 01:16:56,768
Such a silly girl and a Doctor!

1114
01:16:57,217 --> 01:17:00,175
So enjoy it, these are wedding cakes...
Have one!

1115
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:03,250
Am l not too old for her?

1116
01:17:03,377 --> 01:17:06,528
Old? You?
You are the best age!

1117
01:17:06,697 --> 01:17:09,769
Mature - and handsome!
- Please stop it...

1118
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:13,134
Truly.
lntelligent, handsome...

1119
01:17:16,137 --> 01:17:19,015
That damned bastard!

1120
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,247
But l will settle accounts with him!

1121
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:38,175
Folks!

1122
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:41,574
Father!

1123
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,926
Such deep wounds!

1124
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:51,975
This´ll be my death.

1125
01:17:54,017 --> 01:17:56,975
Sodom and Gomorra.

1126
01:17:57,817 --> 01:18:00,775
The third suitor this week!
Can´t keep up with the latest!

1127
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:06,415
This looks like a message

1128
01:18:06,537 --> 01:18:09,176
about groom status in the Czech Lands...

1129
01:18:10,217 --> 01:18:13,573
lt cost me my blood...

1130
01:18:14,617 --> 01:18:17,051
That´s true, Father.

1131
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:20,369
lt cost her a glass-full.

1132
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:25,973
l´ll show you
The Torture of St Sebastian.

1133
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:30,855
He suffered even more.

1134
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:37,255
Sit down, Kelisova.
No thanks, l´ll stand.

1135
01:18:40,697 --> 01:18:43,131
A martyr.

1136
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:46,249
My life is Christ´s,

1137
01:18:48,697 --> 01:18:51,257
You made your choice!

1138
01:18:51,377 --> 01:18:54,335
You´ll enjoy this.

1139
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:57,648
He was so young and handsome.
l cry every time.

1140
01:19:03,897 --> 01:19:06,650
No, l cannot,

1141
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:10,808
Courage! Obey your master!
Shoot!

1142
01:19:16,897 --> 01:19:19,809
l entrust my soul to you, oh Lord,

1143
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:25,050
Ouch!

1144
01:19:34,297 --> 01:19:36,652
Mend, mend...

1145
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:39,655
Don´t be scared, l´m with you.
- l do not know, my dear...

1146
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,655
Locked herself in again.

1147
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:45,735
l´ll beat it out of her!
Up you go, Karel.

1148
01:19:46,097 --> 01:19:48,133
Do you think, Marus?
- Of course,

1149
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,173
be a man!

1150
01:19:50,257 --> 01:19:52,452
l´ll climb up, then.
- C´mon!

1151
01:19:56,897 --> 01:19:59,855
Don´t be so naughty, Mum!

1152
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,650
Well, well, doctor!

1153
01:20:04,097 --> 01:20:06,053
Come and get it!

1154
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:09,135
She´s spying on us again.

1155
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:12,653
Up you go, Doctor dear!

1156
01:20:24,097 --> 01:20:25,655
lt´s me, Karel!

1157
01:20:29,697 --> 01:20:32,257
l don´t suppose she´s there.

1158
01:20:32,337 --> 01:20:35,249
Try again, properly.

1159
01:20:38,617 --> 01:20:41,575
l probably love you, dear.

1160
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:44,655
l´ll probably marry you.

1161
01:20:51,497 --> 01:20:54,614
Open up or l´m coming in!

1162
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:01,136
Are you okay?

1163
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:04,135
Come on up!
Just come here, Kaja, are you alive?

1164
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:06,970
l seem to be alive...

1165
01:21:07,097 --> 01:21:10,055
l will rescue you, do not be afraid!
Wait a moment, l will help you!

1166
01:21:10,897 --> 01:21:13,127
Let me help you.

1167
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,407
What´s up?

1168
01:21:32,497 --> 01:21:34,533
l don´t feel like going home.

1169
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:37,376
ln trouble?

1170
01:21:37,497 --> 01:21:40,455
l am always in trouble,
you take it easy.

1171
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:42,647
What is?

1172
01:21:42,777 --> 01:21:45,849
Mum´s after another man for Blazena.

1173
01:21:46,697 --> 01:21:49,257
She´s trying the Doctor?

1174
01:21:49,377 --> 01:21:52,414
He fell off the ladder to her loft.

1175
01:21:52,497 --> 01:21:55,295
lsn´t she there with them?
- She´s sulking.

1176
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:58,454
l´ll tell you where,
for a cigarette.

1177
01:22:06,097 --> 01:22:08,657
Tell me, then.

1178
01:22:08,777 --> 01:22:11,655
Matches.

1179
01:22:12,897 --> 01:22:16,253
You´ll shit your trousers.
Up in the loft, where else.

1180
01:22:16,857 --> 01:22:18,813
Mind you don´t say
l told you!

1181
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,611
Sure. Thanks!

1182
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:30,856
Switch it off, you ass!

1183
01:22:30,937 --> 01:22:33,246
Come and see!

1184
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:36,654
She´s been at the Doctor
even shoved him off the ladder!

1185
01:22:36,897 --> 01:22:39,457
Let us have a smoke.

1186
01:22:39,577 --> 01:22:43,013
No thanks, l tried when l was a girl,
and the result was horrible.

1187
01:22:43,137 --> 01:22:46,095
Do not tell me...
- All right, it´s a special day...

1188
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:48,447
Well, well.

1189
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:00,531
Marus...

1190
01:23:00,697 --> 01:23:02,847
You´ll shit your knickers!

1191
01:23:02,977 --> 01:23:05,730
Marus, now, what´s the matter
with you...

1192
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:08,975
lf they catch the Doctor
you´ll marry the lady engineer!

1193
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:11,657
Done.

1194
01:23:31,577 --> 01:23:33,454
Leave me alone!

1195
01:23:34,657 --> 01:23:37,967
Leave me alone...

1196
01:23:40,257 --> 01:23:43,647
Nononononononono ...

1197
01:23:43,897 --> 01:23:46,855
But l´d rather you didn´t.

1198
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:51,250
Lady engineer - ha!

1199
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,333
Come help me!

1200
01:23:57,457 --> 01:24:00,051
Light, moonlight, starlight ...

1201
01:24:00,177 --> 01:24:02,133
Leave me alone!

1202
01:24:02,217 --> 01:24:04,367
He´s our boy!

1203
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,647
Must l drive him home?

1204
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:08,967
Not happy about it, l tell you!

1205
01:24:09,097 --> 01:24:12,089
Shut up and go,
and don´t say l´m tipsy!

1206
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:16,255
Shine, moon, shine ...

1207
01:24:16,497 --> 01:24:19,455
l am shining, l am starlight.

1208
01:24:22,297 --> 01:24:25,255
Where´s he got the keys?
- Have a look!

1209
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:28,375
Want me to search him?! - Just
have a look, shut up and look for them!

1210
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:31,655
Hold him up!
- l am!

1211
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:35,215
Stupid, this!
Getting him drunk...

1212
01:24:35,697 --> 01:24:38,655
He did his own drinking.

1213
01:24:38,897 --> 01:24:41,365
He could´ve spent the night

1214
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:43,567
on the kitchen sofa.

1215
01:24:43,657 --> 01:24:46,251
Can´t find them?

1216
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:49,257
Watch me, then!

1217
01:24:49,337 --> 01:24:52,056
Hold him up!

1218
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:55,448
Karel Kroupa M.D. and Blazena Skopkova

1219
01:24:56,697 --> 01:25:00,053
announce their wedding on ...

1220
01:25:06,297 --> 01:25:09,255
Drive slowly
so he doesn´t vomit.

1221
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,650
Just wait and see, Blazena,

1222
01:25:13,777 --> 01:25:16,655
when you come down!

1223
01:25:34,257 --> 01:25:36,646
Damn...

1224
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:45,655
l mean ...
They got him drunk and raped him!

1225
01:25:45,777 --> 01:25:48,245
This is what the family is like!

1226
01:25:48,337 --> 01:25:50,453
Don´t tell me, Vlasta!

1227
01:25:50,537 --> 01:25:52,653
l saw it with my own eyes!

1228
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:55,655
That is not possible.
- Yes it is possible.

1229
01:25:56,697 --> 01:25:59,450
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1230
01:26:01,297 --> 01:26:04,653
l wish everyone well,
but...

1231
01:26:06,017 --> 01:26:08,975
Can you keep a secret?

1232
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:13,053
Will you do me a favour?

1233
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:17,606
For you - anything.

1234
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:20,655
A big secret...

1235
01:26:22,097 --> 01:26:25,248
What disgusting is going on?
Ladies!

1236
01:26:25,697 --> 01:26:27,847
That´s for the Chief to say.

1237
01:26:27,937 --> 01:26:29,893
Good morning.
- Morning.

1238
01:26:30,017 --> 01:26:32,292
What is it now?
- l´d like to ask the TV people

1239
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:34,851
to the wedding.

1240
01:26:34,977 --> 01:26:37,650
A real South-Bohemian wedding!

1241
01:26:37,737 --> 01:26:40,376
They could make a shock.

1242
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:42,852
Shot. - Well, l say,
like the news headlines ...

1243
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:45,855
... for the ´´topical events´´ program!

1244
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:48,650
Super, l adore weddings!
l really do, Dear!

1245
01:26:48,777 --> 01:26:51,245
Me too.
- Am l right, Beda?

1246
01:26:51,337 --> 01:26:53,373
Well...

1247
01:26:54,297 --> 01:26:57,130
Will they be done by eleven?

1248
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:59,253
There is nothing more to do
in the cowshed.

1249
01:26:59,337 --> 01:27:02,647
They´ll soon be done, the cows,
us and that´s it!

1250
01:27:02,777 --> 01:27:05,735
And who´s marrying Blazena?

1251
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:08,975
Don´t you know?

1252
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,969
The Doctor!
- Mr. Kroupa...

1253
01:27:12,097 --> 01:27:14,053
Kaja...

1254
01:27:14,497 --> 01:27:17,648
Dr Kroupa?
What a match for her...

1255
01:27:20,097 --> 01:27:22,486
Fantastic!

1256
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:25,137
lt´s back in fashion now!

1257
01:27:25,257 --> 01:27:27,976
But what is rising over me...

1258
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:30,736
There is sunrise in the window,
and Julie is the sun.

1259
01:27:30,857 --> 01:27:33,815
Rise, smart sun, and beat the moon

1260
01:27:33,937 --> 01:27:36,815
he is already pale with envy anyway,

1261
01:27:36,937 --> 01:27:39,815
that you are more beautiful,
as his servant.

1262
01:27:39,937 --> 01:27:42,815
When he is so envious, do not serve him.

1263
01:27:42,937 --> 01:27:45,497
Shit, there´s a spot here,

1264
01:27:45,617 --> 01:27:48,575
but it´s nylon,
it´ll wash out.

1265
01:27:51,297 --> 01:27:54,050
Why didn´t you marry?

1266
01:27:54,697 --> 01:27:58,656
He was married, two kids,
and the bastard hated opera.

1267
01:27:59,617 --> 01:28:02,654
So what shall l do with him?
Slip into the shoes!

1268
01:28:02,897 --> 01:28:05,855
They´re lovely!

1269
01:28:07,697 --> 01:28:10,655
Do they fit?

1270
01:28:10,777 --> 01:28:13,735
Fine!
l wish it were over with.

1271
01:28:15,497 --> 01:28:18,250
Mum´ll get a heart attack...

1272
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:21,614
No she won´t,
leave that to me.

1273
01:28:21,777 --> 01:28:24,655
l´ll lend her

1274
01:28:24,777 --> 01:28:27,655
my Romeo and Juliet.

1275
01:28:28,097 --> 01:28:31,055
Here it is, look.

1276
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:36,855
That´s too thick for her.

1277
01:28:37,017 --> 01:28:39,850
She´ll murder us in the first act...

1278
01:28:39,977 --> 01:28:42,810
l´m ever so pleased!

1279
01:28:42,897 --> 01:28:45,252
l always loved a bit of intrigue.

1280
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:47,652
Don´t worry, l am in it with you now.

1281
01:28:47,777 --> 01:28:50,655
We´ll show those pig-heads

1282
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:53,735
and act out some Shakespeare!

1283
01:28:53,857 --> 01:28:56,815
Better not.

1284
01:29:02,497 --> 01:29:05,455
Kroupa...

1285
01:29:08,497 --> 01:29:11,455
you can hardly tell.

1286
01:29:11,657 --> 01:29:14,649
l´m to copy that 57 times?!

1287
01:29:14,897 --> 01:29:17,047
Shut up and write!

1288
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:19,850
You deserve worse punishment
for your darts!

1289
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,007
And you stop snuffling

1290
01:29:22,097 --> 01:29:24,975
like a wild boar!

1291
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:27,850
Leave me alone at last!

1292
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:31,054
You´ve cut out my beer,
now my breathing - what a life...!

1293
01:29:31,497 --> 01:29:34,375
You can breathe all you want.
Just don´t snuffle!

1294
01:29:34,617 --> 01:29:37,575
Leave me alone and write your stuff!

1295
01:29:38,217 --> 01:29:41,015
Don´t dig that pen in so!

1296
01:29:41,097 --> 01:29:43,850
l heard!
- Come on!

1297
01:29:43,937 --> 01:29:46,053
We´re inviting half the county.

1298
01:29:46,137 --> 01:29:48,128
lmpossible. So many addresses...

1299
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:50,566
The postage it´ll cost!

1300
01:29:50,657 --> 01:29:53,649
The price of 3 crates of beer.

1301
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:56,655
That´s all you think of,

1302
01:29:56,777 --> 01:29:58,449
instead of your daughter´s future.

1303
01:29:58,537 --> 01:30:00,493
Well, yes...

1304
01:30:00,617 --> 01:30:03,848
Of course!
What do you see in drink?

1305
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:07,848
lf l tell you,
you´ll drink too!

1306
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:11,375
We´ve got to move now
we caught the Doctor

1307
01:30:11,497 --> 01:30:14,375
before he backs out like Pepa.

1308
01:30:14,497 --> 01:30:17,250
You´d hound up someone else.

1309
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:20,648
Hounded´em up? Next you´ll be saying
l hounded you up too!

1310
01:30:23,497 --> 01:30:25,567
What are you writing there?

1311
01:30:25,657 --> 01:30:28,455
There´s a double ´´d´´ in wedding!

1312
01:30:28,577 --> 01:30:30,727
l see...

1313
01:30:30,857 --> 01:30:33,815
Think of the spelling a little.

1314
01:30:33,937 --> 01:30:36,849
Remember your spelling lessons

1321
01:30:57,857 --> 01:31:00,735
Did your Mum slap you around too?

1322
01:31:00,897 --> 01:31:03,855
No. Only yours does.

1323

You´ll write to that engineer lady.

Well, chairman said to take her with me.

01:31:56,977 --> 01:31:59,855
Why doesn´t Eva go?

01:31:59,977 --> 01:32:03,253
Their computer´s in the shits,

Travelling, are you?

1336
01:32:38,777 --> 01:32:41,849
To my aunt´s in Bavorov -

1337
01:32:43,097 --> 01:32:45,930
This way to Bavorov?!

1338
01:32:46,297 --> 01:32:48,652
Fat Joseph is giving me a lift.

1339
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:51,655

01:32:57,017 --> 01:32:59,815
What´s he doing there?

1343
01:32:59,897 --> 01:33:02,855
Chasing the gals.
Here he is!

1344
01:33:08,577 --> 01:33:11,250
You´d better step back.

1345
01:33:13,497 --> 01:33:16,409
Hello, Father!
Mushrooming?

1346

There are no mushrooms here.

1347
01:33:18,777 --> 01:33:21,132
Would you like a lift?

1348
01:33:21,217 --> 01:33:23,173
No! God forbid!

1349

1350
01:33:26,057 --> 01:33:28,969
The Temptations of St Anthony?

1351
01:33:29,097 --> 01:33:31,657
Send Cecily over for it!

1352
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:34,615
The sisters will be pleased.

1353
01:33:34,737 --> 01:33:37,649
May God repay you!

1354
01:33:37,857 --> 01:33:40,815

Let´s get dressed, quickly!

Stop your silly nonsense!

1363

Why were you in Bavorov so long?

1389

The wedding´s day after tomorrow

Marus!

l can´t really.

1398
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:37,968
Forget it, you must!

1399
01:38:38,057 --> 01:38:40,651
You´re going to marry him
if l pull you there

1400
01:38:40,737 --> 01:38:42,967
by your hair!

1401
01:38:43,097 --> 01:38:45,088
Don´t piss me off, Blazena!

1402
01:38:45,177 --> 01:38:47,407
We´ve spent thousands,

1403
01:38:47,497 --> 01:38:49,613
sent out invitations 3 times -
yes - no -

1404
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:51,653
yes - no...

1405
01:38:51,737 --> 01:38:54,251

01:38:54,337 --> 01:38:56,407
and you say you won´t marry him...

01:38:56,497 --> 01:38:59,057
l swear

1408
01:38:59,137 --> 01:39:01,651
you will!

1409
01:39:01,857 --> 01:39:04,246
As you like,

01:39:04,337 --> 01:39:07,249
l meant well.

1411
01:39:10,697 --> 01:39:12,653
She meant well?

1412
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:15,251
Open this!

1413
01:39:16,697 --> 01:39:19,052
Here we are!

1414
01:39:19,137 --> 01:39:21,446
l´m going to be so embarrassed!

1415
01:39:24,177 --> 01:39:26,133
You always say that...

1416
01:39:26,217 --> 01:39:28,173
Who gave you this watch?

1417
01:39:28,257 --> 01:39:30,452
l bought it from the Vietnamese.
lt is a diving watch.

1418
01:39:30,537 --> 01:39:32,493
Oh yes, of course...

1419
01:39:32,577 --> 01:39:34,852
Here we go!
How about some coffee?

1420
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:36,893
Me...
- Here too, here.

1421
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,650
Stop it, you animal!

1422
01:39:39,777 --> 01:39:42,245
lt´s the overture...

1423
01:39:44,097 --> 01:39:46,930
l´ve never seen a porno film.

1424
01:39:47,017 --> 01:39:48,973
That l don´t believe you.

1425
01:39:51,417 --> 01:39:54,329
What my eyes have seen today -

1426
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:59,329
rimmed them red with tears.

1427
01:39:59,497 --> 01:40:02,375
l begged St Anthony

1428
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:05,455
for the strength of silence.

1429
01:40:05,697 --> 01:40:08,655
But it is a real test.

1430
01:40:10,697 --> 01:40:13,655
l beg you

1431
01:40:13,897 --> 01:40:16,855
to be ready

1432
01:40:17,017 --> 01:40:19,895
by day and by night -

1433
01:40:20,017 --> 01:40:22,975
the hour of punishment

1434
01:40:23,497 --> 01:40:26,455
is high, am l right, Matouskova...

1435
01:40:27,297 --> 01:40:29,253
Amen.

1436

Amen.

1437
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:34,496
Let us imbibe strength

1438
01:40:34,617 --> 01:40:37,575
from the suffering of the saints.

1439
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:40,530
Dear sisters...

1440
01:40:40,697 --> 01:40:43,655
lt is going to be

1441
01:40:43,777 --> 01:40:46,735
an unforgettable experience.

1442
01:40:51,097 --> 01:40:54,055
Dear God,,,
Heavens,,,

1443
01:40:54,297 --> 01:40:57,255
What is it?
- Suffering.

My dear Lord,,,

1445

to overcome temptation ,,,

1448
01:41:19,977 --> 01:41:22,855
What did you put on, Joseph?!

Well, that lS great...

Try taking me out again...

1452

And now this!...

The shit´s hit the fan!

Do l know? l am not using it!
- Light a candle, then!

1481
01:43:06,377 --> 01:43:09,050
Okay, but where is that?
- l do not know

1482
01:43:14,697 --> 01:43:17,655
Aren´t they beautiful?

1483
01:43:19,177 --> 01:43:22,169
What wedding-night!

1484
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,655
Any complaints, Madam?

1485
01:43:25,777 --> 01:43:28,735
Plenty...

1486
01:43:30,497 --> 01:43:32,727
What´s wrong?

1487
01:43:32,857 --> 01:43:35,052
l´m getting pricked.

1488
01:43:35,137 --> 01:43:37,128
Really?
- Everywhere...

1489
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:39,651
Absolutely everywhere?
- Absolutely...

1490
01:43:53,697 --> 01:43:56,655
... your will be done on Earth

1491
01:43:57,097 --> 01:43:59,816
as it is in Heaven. ...

1492
01:43:59,937 --> 01:44:02,735
This is no good either...

1493
01:44:02,857 --> 01:44:05,735
... Give us

1494
01:44:05,857 --> 01:44:08,655
our daily bread ...

1495
01:44:08,777 --> 01:44:11,894
... l can´t bash the thing...

1496
01:44:13,697 --> 01:44:16,973
... Lead us not into temptation...

1497
01:44:18,937 --> 01:44:21,815
Get off,

1498
01:44:21,937 --> 01:44:24,497
you swine!

1499
01:44:24,617 --> 01:44:27,256
Stop it right away

1500
01:44:27,377 --> 01:44:30,050
or you will see!
Scram, you bastard!

1501
01:44:39,297 --> 01:44:42,653
She´s losing her voice!
Father!

1502
01:44:43,697 --> 01:44:47,087
What is up?
- D´you hear?

1503
01:44:49,297 --> 01:44:52,255
She´s losing her voice!
Today of all days!

1504
01:44:54,017 --> 01:44:57,248
The hour of punishment is close.

1505
01:45:15,697 --> 01:45:17,653
Priest, priest...
- Come, Cecily!

1506
01:45:17,777 --> 01:45:20,132
... l am alone in my own estate...
- No, l don´t drink.

1507
01:45:20,217 --> 01:45:22,208
But Cecily will.
One drink...

1508
01:45:22,297 --> 01:45:24,367
Well then only.
- And one more...

1509
01:45:24,497 --> 01:45:26,453
Dear God...

1510
01:45:28,897 --> 01:45:31,331
Will you have one? Here.

1511
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:33,647
What a pity.
- You cannot escape. So come on.

1512
01:45:33,897 --> 01:45:36,650
He slipped him this filthy thing...

1513
01:45:36,777 --> 01:45:38,972
Do not tell me... Pepa?

1514
01:45:39,097 --> 01:45:41,531
Saw it with my own eyes!

1515
01:45:41,617 --> 01:45:43,573
They were quite naked!

1516
01:45:43,697 --> 01:45:46,655
Why aren´t you dressed yet?

1517
01:45:46,737 --> 01:45:49,649
You should be ready now!
Surely you don´t want a drink?!

1518
01:45:49,777 --> 01:45:51,733
Well, let her be...
- Why should?!

1519
01:45:51,817 --> 01:45:54,126
She´s a bit tearful, so what?
- And l am a bit hard!

1520
01:45:54,257 --> 01:45:56,248
Goodness...
When l was getting married ...

1521
01:45:56,377 --> 01:45:59,130
Stop it!
- What is Liddy doing there?

1522
01:45:59,697 --> 01:46:02,928
Heavens above!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1523
01:46:03,697 --> 01:46:06,450
Out of the way!

1524
01:46:06,577 --> 01:46:09,455
We have visitors!

1525
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:13,653
How nice to see you.

1526
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:17,647
Welcome.

1527
01:46:19,897 --> 01:46:22,411
Hello, mother dear!

1528
01:46:22,537 --> 01:46:25,449
How are you?
How well you look!

1529
01:46:26,817 --> 01:46:29,047
God! You see...

1530
01:46:29,177 --> 01:46:32,135
l don´t believe it!
- Marenka!

1531
01:46:32,697 --> 01:46:35,655
Annie my lovely...

1532
01:46:35,777 --> 01:46:38,655
l´m so glad to see you!

1533
01:46:40,097 --> 01:46:42,691
Where´s Rose?
- They went by train.

1534
01:46:42,817 --> 01:46:45,695
Come on in.

1535
01:46:53,097 --> 01:46:55,657
Hostice!
We´re not stopping, we´re late!

1536
01:46:55,737 --> 01:46:58,251
You will get off in Volyne.

1537
01:46:58,377 --> 01:47:01,050
Stop, we´re attending a wedding!

1538
01:47:04,697 --> 01:47:07,655
lf you´re good at jumping off
l´ll slow her down.

1539
01:47:07,897 --> 01:47:10,855
Okay.
- What? l´m to jump?!

1540
01:47:15,697 --> 01:47:19,656
Jump!
Hurry, we´re late!

1541
01:47:25,297 --> 01:47:27,936
Rùza, do not be afraid, you must follow
the direction... Jump, l will catch you!

1542
01:47:29,697 --> 01:47:32,655
Great... Are you OK?

1543
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:35,847
Whose wedding?

1544
01:47:35,977 --> 01:47:38,445
Go to the devil!

1545
01:47:38,697 --> 01:47:41,655
All this running about...

1546
01:47:42,617 --> 01:47:45,336
Give them my best wishes!

1547
01:47:46,697 --> 01:47:49,052
My, you´re taking your time... Jump!

1548
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:53,053
You could be free, like...

1549
01:47:57,497 --> 01:47:59,965
We should have told them.

1550
01:48:00,097 --> 01:48:03,055
There´s no talking to them.

1551
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:06,249
... like fish in the stream...

1552
01:48:08,297 --> 01:48:11,050
Mother´s going to kill me...

1553
01:48:11,177 --> 01:48:13,611
Get along with you...

1554
01:48:14,297 --> 01:48:17,653
Some loss of face
might do those pig-heads some good.

1555
01:48:21,017 --> 01:48:23,815
That poor Doctor -

1556
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:26,855
no more ear-drops from him.

1557
01:48:27,377 --> 01:48:29,971
Come right in.

1558
01:48:32,497 --> 01:48:35,250
Mother,

1559
01:48:35,377 --> 01:48:38,210
what have you done now...

1560
01:48:42,257 --> 01:48:45,647
Just come in.

1561
01:48:55,497 --> 01:48:58,057
Comrade engineer...
- Mrs. Skopkova...

1562
01:48:58,177 --> 01:49:00,645
What an honour for us!

1563
01:49:00,777 --> 01:49:03,337
And your son?
- ln the army now.

1564
01:49:03,457 --> 01:49:06,255
l see, he is serving ...
- ... serving his country.

1565
01:49:06,537 --> 01:49:09,654
May l introduce my wife...
My new wife.

1566
01:49:10,297 --> 01:49:12,936
My pleasure, madam.
but you shouldn´t have...

1567
01:49:13,057 --> 01:49:15,935
Well...
- Take it, Dad!

1568
01:49:16,897 --> 01:49:19,650
To your health... Have some.
Do come in!

1569
01:49:20,857 --> 01:49:22,813
Yes, thank you.

1570
01:49:23,097 --> 01:49:26,055
Son!
- Marenka...!

1571
01:49:26,697 --> 01:49:29,655
My son! My son!

1572
01:49:31,297 --> 01:49:34,653
This is my Mum.
- Good morning, madam. Come in.

1573
01:49:38,177 --> 01:49:41,214
We came by train...
- So stop crying!

1574
01:49:41,297 --> 01:49:43,970
Rùza!
- My Vlastik... lsn´t he handsome?

1575
01:49:44,097 --> 01:49:47,055
Yes, he is. Go wash yourself!
What´s this?

1576
01:49:51,897 --> 01:49:54,650
This surely....was enough...
- l´ll slap your face for you!

1577
01:49:54,777 --> 01:49:57,371
Take it and go!
- They´ve arrived! -Who?

1578
01:49:57,457 --> 01:49:59,891
Television! ln the cowshed!
- No!? - Yes!

1579
01:50:14,497 --> 01:50:17,455
The Chief´ll stand here ...

1580
01:50:20,177 --> 01:50:22,213
Like this? Mister...

1581
01:50:22,297 --> 01:50:24,447
Are you mad?
Nonsense,

1582
01:50:24,537 --> 01:50:26,812
the other way!
Like a stupid cow!

1583
01:50:29,497 --> 01:50:32,216
Get ready, friends...

1584
01:50:32,297 --> 01:50:35,175
Come on! Let´s start! Camera!

1585
01:50:35,257 --> 01:50:36,610
Ouch!

1586
01:50:36,697 --> 01:50:39,655
You´ll break her leg, idiot!

1587
01:50:40,697 --> 01:50:43,052
You idiot!

1588
01:50:43,297 --> 01:50:46,050
Camera!
- Three hundred and seventy ...

1589
01:50:46,377 --> 01:50:49,050
How they managed these flasks ...

1590
01:50:49,177 --> 01:50:52,055
... tasks ...
hell, again!

1591
01:50:53,097 --> 01:50:55,850
These tasks were taken in hand

1592
01:50:55,937 --> 01:50:58,451
and we came to Hostice to see.

1593
01:50:58,577 --> 01:51:01,330
You won the State Milk Prize.

1594
01:51:01,457 --> 01:51:04,415
You even did better than Slusovice!

1595
01:51:04,537 --> 01:51:07,529
Wherein lies your success?

1596
01:51:07,657 --> 01:51:10,217
Well, come on...

1597
01:51:10,337 --> 01:51:13,170
We gave an opportunity to the young,

1598
01:51:13,297 --> 01:51:16,255
to those who work instead of gabbing!

1599
01:51:17,097 --> 01:51:20,055
The famous Planicka method is yours?

1600
01:51:20,177 --> 01:51:22,247
Me not ... Well, yes ... l ...

1601
01:51:22,377 --> 01:51:24,333
l typed it out for him.

1602
01:51:24,417 --> 01:51:26,453
l was correcting mistakes
in spelling.

1603
01:51:26,537 --> 01:51:28,846
Are you the famous Planicka?

1604
01:51:28,977 --> 01:51:31,935
l´m his father, he´s in the army.
- How moving!

1605
01:51:32,057 --> 01:51:34,571
What do you say, as his father?

1606
01:51:34,697 --> 01:51:37,450
lt is the merit

1607
01:51:37,577 --> 01:51:40,489
of the whole collective...

1608
01:51:40,697 --> 01:51:43,052
What´s this idiotic thing here?!

1609
01:51:43,177 --> 01:51:45,850
What do the cowshed nurses think?

1610
01:51:45,937 --> 01:51:47,893
Ouch!

1611
01:51:49,497 --> 01:51:51,453
Three hundred and seventy three.

1612
01:51:51,577 --> 01:51:54,045
And what comrades cowgirls
think about it?

1613
01:51:54,297 --> 01:51:57,255
Mrs Konopnik and Mrs Skopkova.

1614
01:51:57,697 --> 01:52:00,530
What made your village famous?

1615
01:52:00,657 --> 01:52:03,251
l think ...
- l think... lt´s because

1616
01:52:03,377 --> 01:52:05,527
we give

1617
01:52:05,657 --> 01:52:08,455
our cows headphones

1618
01:52:08,577 --> 01:52:11,250
we give them all sorts of music
and then milk them.

1619
01:52:12,897 --> 01:52:15,650
They give milk

1620
01:52:16,097 --> 01:52:19,055
the biggest yield in the country.

1621
01:52:19,697 --> 01:52:22,450
We got a ...

1622
01:52:22,577 --> 01:52:24,647
And then ...

1623
01:52:24,737 --> 01:52:27,126
And they made

1624
01:52:27,257 --> 01:52:30,055
a film here -
´´Sun, hay, strawberries´´

1625
01:52:30,137 --> 01:52:32,093
lt was on in the cinema...

1626
01:52:32,177 --> 01:52:34,133
And back to the method...

1627
01:52:34,257 --> 01:52:37,055
Could other co-operatives use
your method?

1628
01:52:37,297 --> 01:52:40,050
Yes,

1629
01:52:40,697 --> 01:52:43,655
it´s significant

1630
01:52:44,297 --> 01:52:47,369
for the Reconstruction ...

1631
01:52:47,497 --> 01:52:50,455
... the animal reconstruction ...

1632
01:52:50,577 --> 01:52:53,535
How ... well ... that ...

1633
01:52:54,297 --> 01:52:57,255
Did l say anything wrong?

1634
01:52:57,697 --> 01:53:00,655
No ... l ... l would like to say that

1635
01:53:00,777 --> 01:53:03,655
here reconstruction is so fast

1636
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:07,255
that we are better off today
than tomorrow.

1637
01:53:07,577 --> 01:53:10,045
The day after tomorrow.

1638
01:53:10,177 --> 01:53:12,645
Yesterday.

1639
01:53:13,097 --> 01:53:16,055
You said that yesterday, Chief!

1640
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:18,408
That´s enough, thank you.

1641
01:53:18,497 --> 01:53:20,453
Cut to the cows with earphones.

1642
01:53:20,537 --> 01:53:23,449
But you mustn´t go!

1643
01:53:23,577 --> 01:53:26,137
We were looking forward so much...
The bride...

1644
01:53:26,497 --> 01:53:29,455
Come and join us, see a South-Bohemian
wedding - the real thing!

1645
01:53:29,577 --> 01:53:31,852
Cakes, girls!

1646
01:53:50,057 --> 01:53:52,287
The great day has arrived.

1647
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:54,806
Unforgettable moments -

1648
01:53:54,937 --> 01:53:58,054
join us too, dear television viewers!

1649
01:54:12,897 --> 01:54:15,650
How many have you had?!

1650
01:54:15,737 --> 01:54:17,693
Let´s go, let´s go!

1651
01:54:17,817 --> 01:54:20,456
Why don´t we walk over?

1652
01:54:20,577 --> 01:54:23,250
l want to show them we can afford it!

1653
01:54:23,377 --> 01:54:25,732
Smile!

1654
01:54:27,697 --> 01:54:30,655
Come and get into the cars!

1655
01:54:32,897 --> 01:54:35,809
Thank you, doctor, thank you.

1656
01:54:37,697 --> 01:54:40,655
Stand up so they can see you!

1657
01:54:41,697 --> 01:54:43,653
But Marenka, leave her alone.

1658
01:54:43,737 --> 01:54:47,047
Such an expensive dress
and she´d plonk herself down...

1659
01:55:05,697 --> 01:55:08,450
New shot!
- Three hundred and seventy six!

1660
01:55:09,497 --> 01:55:12,330
The wedding procession has arrived

1661
01:55:12,417 --> 01:55:15,136
at the local mansion

1662
01:55:15,257 --> 01:55:18,135
and the wedding-hall.

1663
01:55:19,697 --> 01:55:22,655
Bridesmaids here!

1664
01:55:33,177 --> 01:55:35,452
Good morning. Good morning.

1665
01:55:35,657 --> 01:55:38,251

1666
01:55:55,417 --> 01:55:58,648
l´ll give you a slap,
television´s shooting this!

1667
01:55:59,097 --> 01:56:01,657
Come on out!
We´re on television...

1668
01:56:01,737 --> 01:56:03,693
l´ll see to it.

1669
01:56:03,817 --> 01:56:06,809
Doctor, television wants you here...

1670
01:56:09,097 --> 01:56:11,247
Don´t look that way!
l´ll sock you one!

1671
01:56:11,377 --> 01:56:14,335
Television is shooting this,
comb your hair who´s got a comb!

1672
01:56:14,697 --> 01:56:17,655
Line up both sides...
Quickly!

1673
01:56:17,777 --> 01:56:20,655
Comb your hair... Smile...
And watch TV in the evening...

1674
01:56:20,777 --> 01:56:23,735
Come here! Where are you running?
From here!

1675
01:56:31,697 --> 01:56:33,653
Get ready!

1676
01:56:33,937 --> 01:56:37,054
Smile or l´ll slap face!

1677
01:56:40,297 --> 01:56:42,652
Three hundred and seventy seven!

1678
01:56:42,937 --> 01:56:45,656
Action!

1679
01:56:52,857 --> 01:56:55,815
Dammit all!

1680
01:57:00,297 --> 01:57:03,050
What´s the matter with you?

1681
01:57:04,697 --> 01:57:07,655
Pardon me! Sorry... A little bit...

1682
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:09,853
What´s that?

1683
01:57:09,977 --> 01:57:12,935
You broke your promise!
- Pardon me?!

1684
01:57:13,097 --> 01:57:15,053
Eva, right?

1685
01:57:15,177 --> 01:57:17,247
Hello.

1686
01:57:17,377 --> 01:57:20,050
Did Beda tell you we´re getting married?

1687
01:57:20,177 --> 01:57:23,055
Eva!...
- That must be a mistake, mustn´t it?!

1688
01:57:23,177 --> 01:57:26,453
- No mistake.
Beda´ll tell you himself.

1689
01:57:26,577 --> 01:57:28,533
What´s going on here?!

1690
01:57:28,657 --> 01:57:30,852
Excuse me, just one minute.

1691
01:57:30,937 --> 01:57:32,893
What? A minute?

1692
01:57:32,977 --> 01:57:35,445
Save me, somebody!

1693
01:57:35,577 --> 01:57:38,045
Let us save him, dear viewers!

1694
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,452
People...

1695
01:57:40,657 --> 01:57:43,649
Well?
- Well, Beda...

1696
01:57:43,897 --> 01:57:46,650
l was willing to marry you
but l won´t let you make a fool of me.

1697
01:57:46,737 --> 01:57:49,456
Never!
- What are you talking about?

1698
01:57:49,577 --> 01:57:51,647
That Wendy isn´t my child,

1699
01:57:51,777 --> 01:57:53,847
but Venca´s!
You said so, to Miluna!

1700
01:57:53,977 --> 01:57:56,650
Venca?
Nonsense!

1701
01:57:56,777 --> 01:57:59,245
l told Miluna Wendy´s yours!

1702
01:57:59,417 --> 01:58:01,647
That is not true!

1703
01:58:01,777 --> 01:58:04,655
Watch out, l do karate!

1704
01:58:07,177 --> 01:58:10,055
So you say something!
l hate you!

1705
01:58:10,697 --> 01:58:13,655
So Miluna said...

1706
01:58:13,857 --> 01:58:17,645
Did Gaby tell you Wendy was Venca´s?

1707
01:58:18,697 --> 01:58:20,653
What´s all this?

1708
01:58:21,897 --> 01:58:25,048
You made them believe it!

1709
01:58:25,697 --> 01:58:28,655
l just ... made no comment.

1710
01:58:31,097 --> 01:58:34,055
l´ll kill you, you bitch!

1711
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:43,655
Don´t you touch him!
l´ll beat him up myself!

1712
01:58:44,697 --> 01:58:47,655
Evika, Evika, control yourself!

1713
01:58:48,697 --> 01:58:51,655
Out of the way, you scum!

1714
01:58:52,297 --> 01:58:55,448
And you piss off,
or l will break your jaw!

1715
01:58:55,697 --> 01:58:58,655
Dad, after her! After her!

1716
01:59:03,697 --> 01:59:06,655
Eva, control yourself!
- You forced me...

1717
01:59:08,697 --> 01:59:11,575
ln the name of the Town Hall -
for Christ´s sake, stop!

1718
01:59:11,657 --> 01:59:14,251
You pushed your bastard on me?!

1719
01:59:14,377 --> 01:59:17,653
Bastard?
Just say that again!

1720
01:59:19,297 --> 01:59:22,255
Calm down, children!

1721
01:59:34,697 --> 01:59:36,653
Cecilka, Cecilka...

1722
01:59:37,697 --> 01:59:41,053
Didn´t l say so, Father?
When she tried to sing this morning.

1723
01:59:45,097 --> 01:59:47,895
Wait. Mum, we´ll wait!

1724
01:59:56,097 --> 01:59:58,816
Yes, a real South-Bohemian...

1725
01:59:58,937 --> 02:00:01,895
You slut!
- Who is a slut for you?!

1726
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:07,291
Venca, home!
The shame of it!

1727
02:00:09,697 --> 02:00:12,894
Leave me alone,
l´ve got nothing to do with it!

1728
02:00:12,977 --> 02:00:15,935
Stop it, you nasty idiot...!

1729
02:00:16,057 --> 02:00:19,527
lt´s your fault,
had you believed our Venca...

1730
02:00:20,297 --> 02:00:22,492
You shut up!
Hit her, Dad!

1731
02:00:22,617 --> 02:00:24,972
You kept on about the lady engineer!

1732
02:00:25,057 --> 02:00:27,013
lf only you had kept quiet!

1733
02:00:27,297 --> 02:00:30,255
We didn´t force her like you did -
both Joseph and the Doctor!

1734
02:00:30,657 --> 02:00:33,125
How dare you?

1735
02:00:33,297 --> 02:00:35,572
Leave him to me, Mum!

1736
02:00:59,697 --> 02:01:02,655
Silence!

1737
02:01:12,697 --> 02:01:15,655
You stand here!
You read this!

1738
02:01:17,697 --> 02:01:20,655
There´ll be no wedding, sorry.

1739
02:01:20,777 --> 02:01:24,053
The bride

1740
02:01:24,297 --> 02:01:27,050
is already married.

1741
02:01:27,137 --> 02:01:29,093
What?!

1742
02:01:29,297 --> 02:01:32,255
Yes, to Venca Konopnik.

1743
02:01:32,697 --> 02:01:35,655
Never! l´d rather kill you!
Blazena, go home!

1744
02:01:49,697 --> 02:01:52,655
Stop it, everyone!
What´ll the TV viewers thinks?!

1745
02:01:55,297 --> 02:01:58,653
Pepa, where are you? ... Be brave!
you´re the Chief!

1746
02:02:14,697 --> 02:02:17,655
Your mistake dear, it´s me...

1747
02:02:32,017 --> 02:02:34,975
The hour of punishment has arrived.
Courage, sisters!

1748
02:02:47,697 --> 02:02:50,655
Virgin Mary, look at that!

1749
02:02:52,217 --> 02:02:54,447
Blazenka, let´s go!

1750
02:02:57,697 --> 02:03:01,326
Excuse me, comrades!

1751
02:03:02,697 --> 02:03:04,653
Think l´m scared of you?!

1752
02:03:22,697 --> 02:03:25,052
What ... what you...

1753
02:03:25,177 --> 02:03:27,407
l´m sorry.

1754
02:03:27,497 --> 02:03:30,455
l´ll show you, sorry...

1755
02:03:38,297 --> 02:03:41,414
Headmaster, you look a sight!

1756
02:03:44,297 --> 02:03:47,448
Thank you, doctor...
Come,

1757
02:03:47,697 --> 02:03:51,246
l´ll show you my garden.

1758
02:03:53,577 --> 02:03:56,250
Why should not we rejoice,

1759
02:03:56,377 --> 02:03:59,255
why should not we rejoice

1760
02:03:59,337 --> 02:04:02,249
when we are healthy,

1761
02:04:02,337 --> 02:04:05,568
when we are healthy,,,

1762
02:04:11,737 --> 02:04:15,650
They´re fighting!

1763
02:04:16,297 --> 02:04:20,256
l said they´d beat each other up!
