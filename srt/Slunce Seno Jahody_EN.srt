Lean over, lean over, quickly
to the left,

41
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,764
c'mon, quickly, quickly
so we don't overturn!

42
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,645
Lean over, keep balance, balance I say.
C'mon, chop, chop!

43
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:53,804
Okay fine,
we can go back to our places.

44
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,359
I?s your first time here, isn't it?
- Er... um... y... yes!

45
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,081
- I don't know you.

46
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,642
Don't worry,
we haven't overturned yet.

47
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,046
And I've been here since March!
- Excuse me, is this Hostice?

48
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,526
- Yes, but we're not stopping,
Don't get out, we're not stopping,

49
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:19,045
we're late, we'll keep on going!
We'll only get out in Volyne!

50
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,599
We're not stopping!
We're late!

51
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,808
Wha?s your business in Hostice?

52
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,318
Buying the mill?
- The mill?

53
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,163
Yes, this one over there.

54
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:35,205
Even the singer Charlie Gott wanted
to buy it, only i?s haunted.

55
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,607
Sure it is!
A big black dog and dead sexton.

56
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,362
There have already been
a load of people here after it.

57
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,405
We're not stopping, we're running late!

58
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,282
- I see, but...

59
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,207
- So jump out!

60
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,919
- But...!
- I'll slow down for you.

61
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,727
Or are scared?

62
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,764
- For chrissake, Helenka, stop it!

63
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,443
I must see a doctor, my leg's broken,

64
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,325
I just can't walk!
- Can't do! I mean, we really are late!

65
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,839
- To hell with you, half-wit!
I've a good mind to give up!

66
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,081
Wait, wait, take me along to Volyne!
I must see a doctor!

67
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:18,044
My leg's broken in two places
and I've bruised four ribs!

68
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,718
Don't worry, you'll get a tip!
- Careful!

69
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,241
- Tha?s not the way to jump!

70
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:27,200
Keep to the direction
the bus's going in! Tha?s it.

71
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,002
But she mus?ve fancied otherwise
she wouldn't have slowed down for you.

72
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:41,003
People here jump out at full speed,
but then they've got the hang of it.

73
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,160
Are you that Sobotka
who wants to see my mill?

74
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,967
Look at it, a beauty, eh?

75
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,688
I'm not asking much for it.

76
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,487
- But I've already bought a tent.

77
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:58,566
- So aren't you Sobotka from Prague?
Hells bells!

78
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:02,047
- But the conductor said,
it was haunted!

79
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,009
I mean the mill.
- Fiddlesticks!

80
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:08,321
I've lived here for three hundred years
and haven't seen a ghost yet!

81
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,007
St. John of Nepomuk,

82
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,798
St. Mary protect me!
Help!

83
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,357
Anything happened you? Good morning.
- Gee - wha?s this?

84
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,083
They let the air out of my bicycle tyre,

85
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:07,358
threw away the valves
and broke up my basket!

86
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:11,123
Young man, re-direct your steps

87
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,560
and hasten away from this place,

88
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,119
where sin lurks whichever way you turn!

89
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,208
While there is still time!

90
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,403
- But I've come to work here as
a part-timer. On the cooperative farm.

91
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:27,248
- What, a part-timer?

92
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,798
Oh Lord, so young and so courageous?

93
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,727
- Could you show me the way
to the village?

94
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:39,806
- This way - that way.

95
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,205
Follow me,
if you insist.

96
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,042
Cecily!

97
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,962
- Who did this to you, Father?

98
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,958
- Sodom and Gomorrah, Cecilka.

99
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:35,202
Go and invite the villagers
to the evening session.

100
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,565
God bless you, young man.
If there is anything

101
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,404
you need you know where to come.

102
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,408
This is a new part-timer on the farm.

103
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:51,406
Show him the way, Cecilka!
- C'mon!

104
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,765
Tha?s the way.
- Thank you.

105
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,120
- If there's anything,
just whistle and I'll fix it.

106
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,680
Good morning.
- Hi.

107
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:27,199
I... I'm... I'...
I've got here...

108
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:51,800
So you're a part-timer?
Right?

109
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:57,362
Experimental, end-of-term paper

110
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,320
on the milk yield of cows

111
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,407
dependent on the environment.

112
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,968
- I've been the chief
of animal husbandry for eight years

113
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,926
but I've never heard anything so daft!

114
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,848
- I've got it perfectly thought-out.

115
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,159
If you just let me test my method
in practise,

116
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:16,281
it will bring benefits not just
to your cooperative, but to everyone.

117
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,161
- Chairman, we can't afford
any experiments,

118
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,126
let alone where milk's concerned!
- We're expecting a delegation

119
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:21,961
from the Regional Council,
tha?s a big things, sonny!

120
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,125
- Two or three cows will do!
- You know something?

121
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:27,322
Go and settle down,
look around the village,

122
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:32,241
try some of our cherries and come here
tomorrow a sensible talk, how about it?

123
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,442
Evi!
- Yes!

124
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,446
Gee, who is he?
- He'll tell you all himself.

125
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,245
Look, go and put him up somewhere.
But, Evi, mind you're good to him!

126
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:46,002
- Where can I put him up if all
the beds've been taken

127
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,522
by those combined-harvester chaps!

128
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,562
- Evi, please!
- Really, Chairman.

129
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,317
Well, I'll... Okay then!
Blimey.

130
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,207
A pack of Clea, as usual?
- No.

131
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,042
Look, have the people who came here
on holiday last year arrived yet?

132
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,841
No and they're not likely to come.

133
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,681
Dad said he was in prison

134
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,442
and Mum wouldn't
have her alone here for love or money.

135
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:25,727
- Tell Mum then to taken in
our new young part-timer

136
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,523
for at least a few days,
Mr... Wha?s your?

137
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,117
- Planicka. Simon Planicka.
- Yes, Simon Planicka.

138
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:36,364
Go and tell her at least for a few days,
I'll fix it with Mum later.

139
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,008
C'mon, get going!

140
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,763
- See you. Thanks.
- See you! Bye!

141
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:46,925
- Evi, you little cunning vixen!

142
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:49,248
- Go home, Animal!

143
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,206
I'll give you an umbrella, Mother.

144
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,168
An umbrella and a baret!

145
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:01,046
Right.
And mind you don't take it off!

146
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,167
Like last time, there'd be a show-down,
see?

147
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,523
- Oh no! Leave me alone!

148
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:08,682
- You know me, don't you?
- Where're you off to, Molly?

149
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,240
- To Volyne, to have my hair done,
i?s like a haystack.

150
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,368
Hey, Dad, drive it out for me!
- Just me some peace, you're...

151
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,322
For Goïs sake!

152
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,808
- Hey, Vlasta,
want to come along?

153
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,325
- I'll do it myself,
why bother?

154
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:27,438
- But why, the boy'll give you
a lift there this afternoon, won't he?

155
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,204
I keep telling Blazena
to spruce it up at least in front,

156
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:33,008
but no way...
- Brm! Brm! Brm! Drink! Drink!

157
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,478
- Ad him - always the same!
Swilling down beer all the time!

158
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,760
But they do it on purpose,
when you need something

159
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,085
you have to beg for it like a beggar!

160
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:43,003
Leave me alone, will you!
- Why should I?

161
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,125
I told you not to drink the beer
as you'd drive me to Volyne!

162
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,724
And you - i?s like talking
to a brick wall!

163
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:50,118
- Tha?s normal - Dad - Mum.

164
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,601
- Good morning.
- Who is he?

165
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,920
- Simon, he's to stay with us,
he's a part-timer.

166
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,718
The chairman'll explain it to you later.
- Good morning.

167
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,083
- They wouldn't give us a loan
to repair the house, no they wouldn't,

168
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,729
and now they're turning it into a hotel!
But, Dad, you'll tell the chairman this,

169
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,085
you will. Blazena!
- Yes!

170
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,364
- He'll stay with us, for the moment.

171
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,842
Look, take him in, give him some clean
bed linen. And water the house plants!

172
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:14,402
- Sure!
- Yes, sure!

173
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,447
Thanks a lot!
- Yeah!

174
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,846
I wouldn't come in the car with her
for love or money.

175
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,840
Good idea of yours to say
Venca'll drive me.

176
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,047
- I'm surprised,
she's not finished up in a ditch yet!

177
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,366
- I'm surprised,
she's not finished up in a ditch yet!

178
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,927
You're terrible!

179
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:57,208
- Sure, I will!
So who is he?

180
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,602
- Why don't you ask him?

181
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:05,282
- Wha?s he after?
- Not me, clever!

182
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,442
- I'd have to kill him!
The moment he lays a finger on you!

183
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,802
- Ah come on...

184
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:19,118
My dear little murderer!
Jealous are you?

185
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,682
- M'm.
- M'm.

186
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,086
Actually, he's quite all right,
you know?

187
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,603
- M'm?
- Hey, wha?s got into you?

188
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:27,968
- I'll fix him anyway!

189
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:51,119
Make love to me, Nicolas,
make love to me.

190
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,008
Come.

191
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:02,088
I want you to be the first.

192
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,484
Someone young, handsome, fresh,

193
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,720
tender, try to be tender!

194
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,208
- Love!

195
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,808
My love!

196
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,519
- Hey, stop snoring, ïyou hear me?

197
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,119
All right, stop snoring for chrissake!
- I'm deep in thought.

198
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,088
- When you're deep in thought,
the whole village can hear you!

199
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:48,967
Turn on your side at least!
- Nagging me all the time!

200
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,128
- Hi.

201
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,207
Where's Simon, is he asleep?

202
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,725
- Come off it now, be quiet!
Warm up the noodles with ham!

203
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:02,442
- Why are you yelling again?
- Because...

204
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,247
- He's quite nice, isn't he?

205
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,441
- Yeah, he went with Jirka
to pick some cherries.

206
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,600
Wha?re you doing to the electricity,
I'd like to know!

207
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:11,520
- Nothing, there's a power cut!

208
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,645
- Now, when the going was...
Hm, well...

209
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,602
- But i?s a repeat.
- Look, Blazena, fetch a candle!

210
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,839
But I haven't seen it and you -
stop snoring!

211
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,203
What a mess, do something,
ïyou hear me?

212
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,642
- What is it again?
- Wha?s up with you the whole time?

213
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:22,720
Look at the meter,
maybe i?s the fuses!

214
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,926
- I can't find it!
- They'll turn it on again.

215
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,888
The whole village's like this.

216
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,847
- Gee, I'm scared!
- The whole village's like what?

217
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:33,762
She's starting again,
go and talk to her, will you?

218
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:37,199
- Why should I?
If you hadn't given her beer...

219
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,961
- Is she your Mum? Yes, she is!
- It is my mum...

220
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,119
I told you not to give her beer
when she's sitting in the sun!

221
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,562
As you've given her beer
while she was out in the sun,

222
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,002
you go on listening to her.
Wha?ve I got to do with it?

223
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:45,761
Just listen to her.
- Don't drip that candle on me!

224
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,445
- What are you on about?
Well, Mum, Mum, don't be afraid!

225
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,647
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Mum, I'm not a ghost,

226
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:56,118
I'm your daughter!
Don't be afraid!

227
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:58,798
I'll give her an electric torch.
Where's the torch, I wonder?

228
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,640
- Want some noodles?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:08,078
To think there's just one candle
in the whole house!

230
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:32,405
I?ll be a hot day,
Cecilka, a hot, day!

231
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,967
The headmaster's girl's tuning up
her soprano.

232
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,200
Mum...
- Wait a minute, I'll...

233
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,678
- Mum, but, Mum, don't, i?ll do you
good to get some fresh air.

234
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,248
There we are!

235
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,285
Le?s have the feet!
- Just to get rid of me, nothing more...

236
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,044
- C'mon, Mum, le?s lie down like this.
Fetch her some newspaper

237
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,324
to while away her time.
- You always find something

238
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:57,601
to while away my time!
You'd leave an old woman to drop dead!

239
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,601
I know, I know!

240
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,407
Good morning, Mrs Skopkova.

241
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,241
- Hells bells, bloody hell,
you gave me a fright!

242
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,289
- Sorry, I didn't want to!
- Tha?s all right!

243
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,280
- Hi, Simon!
- Hi!

244
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,281
- Wha?ll you have?
Tea or milk?

245
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,161
- Oh no, thank you, don't go
into any expense for me,

246
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,159
I'll get something from
the General Store!

247
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,809
- No way, people'd gossip
that we weren't hospitable.

248
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:28,605
As for expenses, leave them up
to the chairman.

249
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,407
I'll see to it he foots the bill!
C'mon, le?s go!

250
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,208
There're streaks all over the place,
blast it! I?s going to look a sight!

251
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,200
- There's not enough time to whitewash
it. You bet there isn't, chairman!

252
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,923
- When did you start, I'd like to know?

253
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,041
Going like this, you won't be ready
before New Year's Eve!

254
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,279
- You know something, chairman?
Let those folks do it

255
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,848
who've pinched the spraying gun

256
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,926
and messed up the whitewash!

257
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,565
Look, I can easily pack it in,
no problem!

258
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,082
I?s easy to criticize,
anyone can do it!

259
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,365
- Wha?d you mean, criticize?
Nitwit!

260
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,480
Hi, chairman! Hi, Billy!
- Hi!

261
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,242
- Where did you get this this from?
This is oversized even for our Mum.

262
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:09,922
- So take it in then!
I?s a woman's job!

263
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,806
- Yes, i?s a woman's job!
- Ouch!

264
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,125
Hey, keep your hands off!
Private property!

265
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:17,839
- No, you can't, Josef!
We've paid you a hundred and eighty!

266
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:19,158
So make sure i?s finished!

267
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:20,398
- So take it and go
and get some wallpaper

268
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,599
and the Fragrance of the Forest spray!
- Oh, come off it now!

269
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,123
- Yeah.
The dung conveyor keeps breaking down

270
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,962
and as for the water mains, we've been
piddling with it for at least two years!

271
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,564
- Look, Chairman, we could dress up
as angels.

272
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:32,799
- Such baggies!

273
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,605
- Don't you bloody start!

274
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,600
- Don't we look like we belong
to the Red Cross?

275
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,323
- C'mon, girls,
we must do something about it!

276
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,802
- I'd finish it.
- But what about...

277
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:47,841
- Actually, i?s part of my paper -
quality of the environment and...

278
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,199
- Well, if you think so,
here you are.

279
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:53,568
Venca'll show you where to get
whitewash and other... things.

280
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,602
Venca, come here!

281
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:59,566
He's our plumber - a superb fellow!

282
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:02,608
He's able to fix a fridge, a car,
anything you can think of!

283
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,367
They've written twice about him
in the newspaper!

284
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:07,605
- Simon.
- M'm.

285
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,361
- This is Venca, see?

286
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,403
- Wenceslas.
Wenceslas for strangers!

287
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,968
- Sorry.

288
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,319
Hi.
Hey, Miluna, got some cigs?

289
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:28,965
Come off it, as if you didn't know.
A pack of Sparta!

290
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,608
- I don't know, honest,
I haven't looked.

291
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,602
- Have a look then.

292
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,801
- These are my old man's.
- He'll give them to you, Milikin.

293
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,361
- Milikin?
M'm.

294
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,246
- Look, I'm in a hurry,
they've put this millstone

295
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,762
of a new part-timer around my neck!

296
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:45,798
Are you listening?
Stop being clever!

297
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,722
- But there're some at home.
We can go and look.

298
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,240
- Yes, but...
- Scared, eh?

299
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,242
- Scared, yeah right.
- Scared of Blazena, I'd like to know!

300
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,247
- Come off it, me afraid of Blazena?!

301
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:02,165
- So that doesn't see you driving me to
my place.

302
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,400
- Pooh!
Why're you telling me all this crap?

303
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:07,400
- So you'll drive me to town this
afternoon, right?

304
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,124
- I told you I was on duty.
Next time.

305
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,520
- But you'd give a lift to Blazena
if she felt like it.

306
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,639
Never mind, I'll ask someone else.

307
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,519
- I see, Venca, sonny.
Broken down, eh?

308
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,407
- Well, something's wrong
with the engine...

309
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:23,805
- There you are, i?s right again.
So you'll give me a lift.

310
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:27,008
No way could I manage to carry such
a heavy weight!

311
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:29,000
- I'm off to the cow shed
and you haven't got a crash helmet.

312
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,246
- So what? I?s a just a little way off
and you're going that way anyway!

313
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:36,237
I wouldn't be able to carry it
and I've got a bad arm,

314
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:40,324
remember how I tripped once
and fell in front of the store?

315
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,639
And I had to carry it around
in a plaster cast all?

316
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,522
- Yes, but tha?s a long time ago.
- Yes, i?s a long time ago

317
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:48,677
but i?s a still not strong enough.

318
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:52,482
- Hi, I'll just drive Auntie
and the beer home...

319
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,485
- Oh no, I'll manage.

320
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:59,289
I had no idea you were waiting here
for Miluska.

321
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:00,848
- Stay where you are!
- Isn't that so?

322
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,599
- You said you were still not strong
enough. Hold tight!

323
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,400
- Thank you, Venca, sonny.
And sorry for troubling you.

324
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:19,438
- Tha?s all right.
- Miluska's a very nice girl.

325
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,606
And I thought
that you and Blazena...

326
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,999
Well, I must be confused.

327
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,127
- Yeah.
I guess so, Aunt.

328
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:32,801
- I guess so... just you wait! You stud!
Just you wait!

329
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:37,727
But really, sir, oh no,
seriously,

330
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:40,529
the invoice doesn't really belong to us!
- Humpty dumpty!

331
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:44,166
- Chairman, he's kissed me again!

332
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,442
Chair... sir, it is from somewhere else,
someone's jammed the line.

333
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm sorry, Ev, but try to see
my position -

334
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:52,039
the harves?s the main worry and
I can't cope with everything on my own.

335
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:53,608
- So what?
As far as we are concerned,

336
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:56,362
the delegation is welcome
to come any time. Ain't I right, Ev?

337
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:59,919
- I've heard Josef's packed
the whitewashing in.

338
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,922
- As if you didn't know him!
The new one'll finish it off.

339
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:09,166
True, he's nuts...
Ev!

340
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:12,123
...but at least he won't do any harm
with a brush in his hand.

341
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:17,401
Look, Ev...
Look, secretary, we've seen worse.

342
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,241
- What did you say
was the name of the new chap?

343
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:21,560
- Simon.
Simon Planicka.

344
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:23,407
Just like the famous goalkeeper.

345
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,206
- I see!
I thought the name rang a bell!

346
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,198
- Noon!
Knocking off!

347
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:31,967
- Coming!

348
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,120
- Chairman, tell him to lay off!

349
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,888
Take him along, take him
to the cow shed!

350
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,399
She asked him
if he would give her a lift to town

351
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,684
and he said: No -
some other time.

352
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,688
But even then he was stripping her
with his eyes.

353
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:54,803
She was not wearing much
to strip anyway!

354
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,763
I'm sure they've patched it up again.

355
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,199
Now she'll be jumping into the sack
with them both.

356
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:03,163
Upon my soul, Father,

357
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:07,407
I've got a hang for such things.
- But Mrs. Kalis...

358
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,401
- You know me, don't you?

359
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:12,202
Hold it properly, or I'll box your ear!
- I'll puke!

360
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,722
- As long as you don't shit into your
pants!

361
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,244
- Rabbit again!
We have a rabbit every day,

362
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:18,007
even Spot doesn't want it anymore,
isn't it so, Spot?

363
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,603
Aren't you fed up witch rabbits, eh?

364
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,805
- Don't Spot me, or you'll see!
And pick it up, for chrissake!

365
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,288
Such a nice rabbit,
kids in Africa would be over the moon,

366
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,799
just you watch TV, they show it
all the time, how starved they are!

367
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:32,563
But you're so debauched nothing's good
enough for you.

368
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:35,801
- I'll hold it for you, Mrs Skopkova,
I don't mind.

369
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:37,607
- Let him, it won't do him any harm!

370
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,601
- I'll remember that, mate!

371
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,599
- No horsing around! Go home and do
your homework! And you-hold is properly!

372
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:48,765
Tell me, then, what are you,
wha?s your job, who are your parents?

373
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,765
- Does someone have a cow
in the village?

374
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,802
- A cow?

375
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,761
You're very kind, Father!
- Don't mention it.

376
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,322
- They all tell me i?s nonsense...

377
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,639
- Well, everything's is our Lorïs will,
son,

378
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:01,924
this is...
Daisy's at your disposal,

379
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:04,199
do what you think fit!

380
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,607
Cecilka, we're handing Daisy over
into the service of the scientific and

381
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:12,165
technological revolution!

382
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,564
- Le?s say, borrowing, Father!

383
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,442
- Don't worry.
Will you let me?

384
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:40,081
Miss Cecilka, please!

385
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,287
What she had, she's given.

386
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,442
I?s magic, this is magic!

387
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,798
- A miracle! Miracle!

388
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,206
A miracle's happened!

389
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:42,204
- A miracle, folks, where are you?
A miracle's happened, a miracle indeed!

390
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:55,360
Sandokan, Sandokan...
- He's a creep!

391
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,000
I didn't like him right from the start!

392
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:02,880
- What will people from the Council say?
Did it have to be the parson's cow?

393
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:06,806
- And which one, I wonder?
Nobody else's got a cow here

394
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,445
and didn't let him use
the cooperative cows! Poor chap!

395
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,839
- Never mind that!
He shoulïve asked our advice!

396
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:15,478
He'll pack up his things tomorrow
and go!

397
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:19,119
- No, i?s not his fault!

398
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:20,921
- Too bad, isn't it?

399
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:25,041
- Twenty-two liters from one cow!

400
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,484
- Gripe! Who knows what they're up to

401
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,888
and we'll fall for it, hook,
line and sinker!

402
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:30,402
As if we didn't know them.

403
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:34,808
- But maybe he didn't mean any harm,
this Planicek.

404
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,489
- Planicka.
Simon Planicka.

405
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:41,279
Twenty-two, single, student

406
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:44,043
and - contrary to some people -
a decent and good-Iooking fellow.

407
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:45,682
And he smells nice.

408
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,678
- Planicka i?s impossible!

409
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:53,447
He's the director of the regional
agricultural administration!

410
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:57,444
And he's got a son!
- D'you think he's been sent here as...

411
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,643
- I do.
Yes, as the vanguard!

412
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,519
- The vanguard of what?

413
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,281
- The regional delegation,
I'm telling you!

414
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,521
His father's sure a member of it!

415
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,247
- Well, as long as i?s him.

416
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:12,363
- Tha?s what we must find out
as soon as possible!

417
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,801
Discreetly, of course!

418
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:17,279
Not a word to anyone, is that clear?

419
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,125
- Pilatova!
- There!

420
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:39,405
I?s so hushed-up
that he could even be a spy!

421
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:41,920
Are you listening to me?
- Sure.

422
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,207
- Why should we keep a spy in the house...

423
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:47,884
free, I wonder?
You'll tell the chairman tomorrow.

424
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:50,367
I can't even drop off now.

425
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:54,641
I say such a skinny,

426
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,001
half-baked character,

427
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,927
but they are usually the worst!

428
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,601
Still water runs deep.

429
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,125
- C'mon then!

430
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:26,166
Molly, what did you feed
the rabbits with?

431
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:29,527
- What ïyou mean?
- Two of them are lying there

432
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,729
stretched out, bloated!

433
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:35,917
I keep telling you,
don't give them wet clover,

434
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,243
now they're lying there,
two of them bloated...

435
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:40,001
- D'you think I'm daft giving them
wet clover?

436
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:45,203
Bloated... Well, I feed them with grass
from the cooperative.

437
00:30:45,289 --> 00:30:47,359
- Go and have a look then!
- Yes, and I gave them at lunchtime...

438
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:51,398
Listen, don't breathe at me,
you reek of beer and your feet stink!

439
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,400
Go and have a wash, you pig!

440
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,247
What a life!

441
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,363
I?s going to be bloody hot again,
blast it!

442
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:27,927
Oh no, you don't say so!

443
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,920
- I?s true,
otherwise I wouldn't be telling you,

444
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,408
if it were not true!

445
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:36,438
Don't you know it, his father's
a big fish in the Regional Council!

446
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,362
- You don't say so!

447
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,047
Only i?s not the Council,
Pilatova said it was the Ministry!

448
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:42,925
- For chrissake!

449
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:47,480
Only i?s not the Ministry, they say
he's at the top level... Well, you know!

450
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:56,247
I know, chairman, I know!

451
00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:01,678
I'll hush up, I'll be quiet like
a tombstone, you know me! What?

452
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:10,119
Hey, engineer, sir!

453
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:14,203
- Blazena!
Blazena, everything's at stake now!

454
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,243
Bedrich'll tell you.
- Good morning.

455
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:21,601
- Stop pestering the engineer!
D'you think he's your playmate, or what?

456
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:24,647
- No engineer, Mrs. Skopkova,
i?s still far away!

457
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:27,483
- Never mind far away, he's an engineer
and tha?s a fact!

458
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:30,523
- What is it, Mum?
Want to go to the potty?

459
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:33,077
- You dump me...
- Dump me, tha?s right!

460
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:37,880
Look, fetch her a newspaper
to while away her time. Here you are!

461
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,079
- Not the Young Reader, she'll tear it
to pieces, like last time!

462
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,808
- Here you are, go on in!

463
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,920
Well, at last!
I've been waiting all this time!

464
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,607
I'm waiting here and I've nothing to do.

465
00:32:48,689 --> 00:32:50,042
I don't want a newspaper,
I want the pictures.

466
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:52,120
- No, you're not getting them!
- I want the pictures,

467
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:53,682
I don't care for this!

468
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,760
For chrissake, i?s an old newspaper!

469
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:01,721
Good morning.
- Good morning.

470
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,966
You look smart today, Blazenka,
did you make it yourself?

471
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,687
- Well, I had a go at it,
I don't really know...

472
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,248
- What a lovely dress,

473
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,002
you look smashing in it!
They remade an old dress,

474
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,278
her mother used to wear this rag
to school in nineteen forty-six!

475
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:18,404
I?s not the music alone!
I?s a mere link,

476
00:33:22,689 --> 00:33:24,247
which, applied in practise...

477
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:29,366
In short, a clean environment
or indifference

478
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:32,282
or a reckless attitude,
they are all interlinked!

479
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:36,601
- Sure, sure, i?s true! And from now
on you won't use the parson's cow!

480
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,161
You'll have a chance now to repeat
that experiment of yours!

481
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,038
- Unfortunately, a tape recorder's not
sufficient for my experiment.

482
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,598
I needs some appropriate equipment.
Some amplifiers!

483
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,046
- But look, amplifiers cost the earth,
but...

484
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,000
Hey, tha?s an idea,
what if the women sang something...

485
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:55,480
...a sort of choir, you know!
- For chrissake!

486
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,920
- What about it?
- Well...

487
00:33:58,409 --> 00:33:59,558
Well.
- There you are -

488
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:01,128
le?s give it a try.

489
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,685
Fetch the headmistress Hubickova,
we'll get hold of some kids

490
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:08,281
and women in the village and we'll see,
won't we?

491
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,960
- As if we didn't have enough to do!
- C'mon!

492
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,439
- What an idea, chairman!
- Good, isn't it?

493
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:19,125
Watch the chairman, he's having you on!

494
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,800
You must find out from him
who he really is

495
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,164
and what he's actually after in Hostice!
Yeah?

496
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:29,400
But do it inconspicuously,
otherwise i?s a fuck... I mean botch-up!

497
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,161
- Well, what if I botch it up?

498
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,327
- If you botch it up, anyone will!

499
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,842
- I'll give it a try then.

500
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,559
- Tha?s a good girl!
You must do you damnedest, get it?

501
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,800
Give it your all!
I?s in the interest of the cooperative.

502
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,362
- Okay, then.

503
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,049
- I'll be damned if he doesn't fall
for such a dish!

504
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:54,642
He he...
Hi there!

505
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:03,840
What was that?
- You saw, didn't you?

506
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,604
- He was feeling you!
- You're kidding!

507
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:08,602
- Kidding - come off it!

508
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,168
I saw him feeling you, like this!

509
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:13,286
- Ouch, wha?re you doing?
Look at the bruise!

510
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,726
- What were you doing there?
- I?s a secret!

511
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:17,528
- I'm asking you
what you were doing there?

512
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,407
- You're a terrible, jealous nutter!
I'm really fed up with you!

513
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:23,481
- I'll bash his teeth in!
- My sweet little murderer!

514
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,680
- Jump on!
- Wha?re you up to?

515
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,839
- Jump on a keep quiet!
- Next time.

516
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,402
- Stop kidding and climb on!

517
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:31,327
- I really can't, it is in the interest
of the cooperative.

518
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:32,888
I can't tell you more!

519
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,722
- Not interested!
But listen:

520
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,084
If anything happens,
you'll both be in for it...

521
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,918
- You're a funny guy.
Okay, so just a quickie, right?

522
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:47,604
Leave me alone!
- We only have light ale.

523
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:52,280
- Shoe, give me my shoe, ïyou hear me?
Give it to me!

524
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:57,402
I?s my shoe, give it to me!
C'mon!

525
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,362
Leave me alone!

526
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:09,677
- Still at it, Miluna?
There are others available here.

527
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,559
- I?s something you don't understand.

528
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:15,801
- Yes, there are others around!
- Leave me alone!

529
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:17,682
- Others I'm telling you!

530
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,287
...our Willy's ploughing a field,

531
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:27,438
he's got spotty bullocks.

532
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:33,007
When he's done ploughing...

533
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:37,002
- Get going, beast!
...he'll call out to me,

534
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:42,238
he'll know me from afar.

535
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:48,878
When he's done ploughing,
...young Pioneers, smashing kids.

536
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:55,281
- Another one!
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing...

537
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,965
...smashing kids.
- The oven crashed down...

538
00:37:04,249 --> 00:37:09,198
...i?s flying, i?s flying...
- Tra la la la, tra la la la...

539
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,927
I can't look at it such fooling around,
just like in our cow shed!

540
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,923
Some gave more milk,
but some gave less than usual.

541
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,483
Sure...
- They each respond to a different song!

542
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,840
- So that the average milk
yield dropped...

543
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:40,245
- By how much?
- By seven per cent, seven per cent.

544
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,127
- A song, I see.

545
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:51,124
- Don't be cross with me, please,
I... don't be cross, I...

546
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:55,642
- But tha?s all right, just carry on!
I?ll improve with time.

547
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:03,366
- Well, if we get a good tape-recorder
and amplifiers, then...

548
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,885
- And if that doesn't turn out right,
than we'll... Right?

549
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,605
- Right?
- There you are then.

550
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:19,158
Drink, drink, they'd let me perish!
I want a drink, drink, drink!

551
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:23,167
- Fetch her a drink!
Hey, where you are?

552
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,883
He's been back for ages and there's
no food in the house.

553
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:30,242
I'm going for a pint!
And you're to give him lunch,

554
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:31,718
Mum's orders.

555
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,000
- Sure, don't worry,
i?s part of my job description.

556
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:37,887
- Well, at last, someone's good enough
to appear!

557
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,886
You'd let me perish here!
- Cheers, Granny,

558
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:50,724
You're still the best off anyway!
We're going to toil, get it?

559
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,602
To toil - with these hands, get it?

560
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,962
- Bloody hell!
- You don't cheerio, then!

561
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:00,928
Drink then.

562
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:17,566
Can you leave it for a moment?
I've come for a little talk.

563
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:19,208
- Hm.
What about?

564
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:22,244
- About you, for example. You've stayed
with us for nearly five days

565
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,682
and I still don't know anything
about you.

566
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:25,248
- But there's nothing interesting.

567
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,562
- Maybe there is.
Where you come from and so on.

568
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:51,768
Hey, wha?s this, whose crazy idea
this is?

569
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,728
For chrissake, they will not leave me
in peace!

570
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,726
Are you having me on, or what?

571
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,760
- Look, I'm sorry, le?s talk
some other time. Yeah?

572
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:02,917
I must finish this.
...I think I'd rather leave!

573
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:07,802
- Pity!
I may not be in the mood next time.

574
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,885
What is it again?

575
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:17,041
Wonderful! Sure, a desirable match!
Daïs upstairs...

576
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:20,962
Who brinks his breakfast into his bed?
Mum.

577
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,359
- You're absolutely impossible.
- Well, suit yourself!

578
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:29,203
- Brm, brm, brm, brm...

579
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,608
- I'm coming with you!

580
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,520
- You haven't a crash helmet!
- Not interested!

581
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,478
- Where are they? Where are they?
Where are they?

582
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,083
Our aldermen...

583
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,246
Eh?
Blimey...

584
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,041
- Lady, shall I give you a push?

585
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:56,648
- I want to go there, there, there!

586
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:03,321
- Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurrah!

587
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,408
- Annie's gone to fetch some cabbage...
- She must want to kill herself!

588
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:08,968
...fetch some cabbage...
- Hey, folks, come here!

589
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,928
Come and catch her! Come here, don't let
her kill herself! She's a wild one!

590
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,843
Look, she's driving like mad!
I can't catch her!

591
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:20,842
Hey, excuse me!
- Hello!

592
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,921
- Yes, i?s old Zvonicek.
But i?s haunted!

593
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,928
- Haunted?

594
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:43,165
- A big black dog and a dead sexton.

595
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:45,762
Jaro, you're rude!

596
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:47,647
- Le?s go back!
A dead sexton!

597
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:49,128
- But why, she's plastered,
can't you see it?

598
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,962
Haunted - today...
You're like a little kid.

599
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:56,557
Where can I find him?
Hey, where can I find this Mr Zvonecek?

600
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,039
- He says Zvonecek - tha?s good!

601
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:01,920
- C'mon, c'mon!

602
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:06,208
- I?s daft,
I've been saying that from the start!

603
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:07,961
Soon he'll lead the whole village by
the nose!

604
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,688
- But we have to look into it.
I?s no slapdash job.

605
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:13,367
- No wonder the beer's warm!

606
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,719
- What do you want me to do about it...

607
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:19,761
Can you see it, can you see it?
Can you see them?

608
00:42:23,169 --> 00:42:24,602
- Hi!
Hi!

609
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:26,602
- I?s clear, eh?

610
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,168
- Sure.

611
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:34,398
The moment you leave the house for
a while - poor Granny,

612
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:36,480
What a shock!
- But why, she was laughing.

613
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:39,241
- Laughing, but what if a car
bumped into her

614
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:41,797
on the road?
Or if she'd crashed it?

615
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,442
Stop picking at it and eat up!

616
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,008
- I don't want anymore!
- Whadja mean, don't want anymore?!

617
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:47,557
You'll eat it even if you had to stay
up all night! Remember that!

618
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:50,567
And you too...
Dad, come!

619
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,879
Come to the table,
or i?ll be cold like a dog's nose!

620
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:55,645
The girl's the same -
never at home in time!

621
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:58,486
Such a tasty rabbit!

622
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:02,079
Simon's enjoyed it so
and he's used to other things!

623
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,965
But what about you -
have at least the foreleg!

624
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,721
- But I particularly don't like
the foreleg!

625
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:08,686
- Listen, you'll eat the foreleg in
a flash, get it?

626
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:11,044
Put the beer down.
Haven't you had enough?

627
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,926
For chrissake, take off your socks!
- Lay off me for once!

628
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:15,284
- The stink'd make one drop dead!
- Hm.

629
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:17,918
What did you give the rabbits again, eh?
- What could give them?

630
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:20,204
- Two of them are lying there,
all bloated!

631
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:22,799
I keep telling you, don't give them
wet clover, but you won't listen!

632
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:24,124
Two of them are lying there now,
all bloated...

633
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:25,767
- What ïyou think I give them?

634
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:27,442
I gave them cut grass

635
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,326
and they also got
cut grass at lunchtime!

636
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:31,121
- It mus?ve been damp then!

637
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:33,160
- Am I so daft or young
to be such a fool

638
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:36,002
as to give them damp grass?

639
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:38,523
Well, if they're bloated,
go and kill them.

640
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:40,088
So I can make at least minced meat.

641
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:42,046
I'll put some nettles in so i?s tasty!

642
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:44,843
- We had it last week,
we always have minced meat!

643
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:47,762
- You shut up and eat up, you've been
nibbling at it the whole evening!

644
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:49,960
But mark my words, you'll eat up,
have a wash and go to bed, get it?

645
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:52,199
- Eat up, c'mon, eat up!
- Go on eat it! For Chris?s sake,

646
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:55,201
go and do something about your feet,
the stink'd make one drop dead!

647
00:43:55,289 --> 00:43:57,041
Have a wash and hurry up, will you!
- They're clean!

648
00:43:57,129 --> 00:43:58,960
- So we are not the last!

649
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:02,606
- For chrissake, I'm thirsty.
Give me a drink!

650
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,327
- Jesus Christ!

651
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:08,927
...she didn't even know,
trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky,

652
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,560
what her little lacy skirt looked like.

653
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:15,727
Trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky,

654
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:20,008
...she didn't even know
what it look like,

655
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:23,560
what her little lacy skirt looked like.

656
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:28,286
She didn't know which

657
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,519
trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky,

658
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:33,840
Honza's got a black horse,

659
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,278
trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky.

660
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:40,482
She didn't know which

661
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:43,926
Honza's got a black horse.

662
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:49,081
Then she found out which,

663
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,439
trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky,

664
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:54,760
Honza's got a black horse.

665
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:56,999
Trnky, brnky, trnky, brnky.

666
00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:01,401
Then she found out which

667
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:04,925
Honza's got a black horse.

668
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:10,285
- Perfect!
- I?s that big!

669
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:18,489
- Let me thank our ladies for this
musical piece

670
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:21,320
with which they opened our ladies'ball

671
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:24,561
and for this reason the next piece
will also belong to our ladies.

672
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,040
A Ladies'Request Dance!
- Tha?s the way!

673
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,399
- Wait, in the interest
of the cooperative tha?s your dancer.

674
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,118
- Wha?s up?
Well, he's sulking!

675
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:49,961
- Leave it out!
- Oh, right!

676
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:52,563
Yeah, just as I said,
she's an old...

677
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:54,208
- Come off it and put it all here!

678
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,603
- Look, but I'm not much good!
- Never mind,

679
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,361
the banïs good for nothing.

680
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,045
A disco in Malenice, tha?s
a different kettle of fish!

681
00:46:02,129 --> 00:46:03,801
Gee, they're not half making
the place rock!

682
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:16,887
Oh, sorry!

683
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,288
- What did you say?

684
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:25,087
- Well, tha?s something!

685
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,763
- C'mon!
- Don't be silly, I can't!

686
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:33,282
- Come off it!

687
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:50,482
Sure.

688
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:55,443
Hi!
Look, look, she's dancing with this...

689
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,685
- This? Well I never!
He'll kick his teeth in!

690
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:05,045
Well, folks, you have to see it!

691
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:08,402
A well-preserved millstone,

692
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:12,127
eight big rooms...

693
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:17,721
Get off me for Goïs sake,
wait a minute!

694
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:22,479
Wait I'm telling you!
All right, wait!

695
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:30,440
- Dear me!

696
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,522
A beer!

697
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:41,765
Was there a fight?
Was there a fight? Was there a fight?

698
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:43,202
Le?s go, eh?
- May I ask you?

699
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:45,007
- What?
Is Miluna dancing with someone else?

700
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:54,928
Well I never,

701
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:57,284
why don't you throttle his oxygen
tubes a little, this wise guy!

702
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:00,244
- He's making a stooge of you!
Kornuto!

703
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:02,161
- I can't look at it.

704
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,167
- Well, you know -
a more desirable match!

705
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:08,762
- Just like women... You live across
the backyard, he's under the same roof.

706
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,801
- Say it once again!
- There's a fight, I told you so!

707
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:16,759
- Wha?s going on?
- There's a fire, folks, a fire, a fire!

708
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:19,483
A disaster Sosnovec's on fire!

709
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:22,083
Sosnovec's on fire!
- What, there's a fire in the forest?!

710
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:23,921
- Joe!
Joe, don't go!

711
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:26,722
- Please, don't go anywhere!
- Listen, Sosnovec's on fire!

712
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:41,767
Joe, don't you dare go there in this
suit, ïyou hear me?

713
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,364
Don't pretend you don't, I know

714
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:46,679
you can hear me!
- Miluna! Miluna! Come back!

715
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:49,045
You must take the money before they're
all gone!

716
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:51,563
- Sure. Time's up, we're closing,
there's a fire!

717
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,358
- A fire! A fire! A fire!
Dear me,

718
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:58,803
when the pig-sty caught fire
in fifty-nine,

719
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,087
that was hell!

720
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:05,317
- Those who're not helping won't get
a drink. The bill's 158.80!

721
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:08,242
- We're not going to help,
for we haven't set anything on fire.

722
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:11,080
We're going to have a look

723
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:14,639
at the mill!
- Sure, the mill!

724
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:37,044
I must be dreaming!

725
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:39,401
Surely not!

726
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,960
- The bloody Kalis woman!

727
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:54,168
- Little moon,

728
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:57,561
in the deep...
- Shut up,

729
00:49:57,649 --> 00:50:02,598
the teacher's singing!
...skies,

730
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,721
- So the Kalis woman was sitting
in front of the pub...

731
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:07,198
- Don't be daft, come on.
- I know.

732
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:10,240
- I did pay for the beers!
- Shut up,

733
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:12,281
the teacher's singing!
...your light can reach afar.

734
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:19,801
You wander throughout

735
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:22,403
the wide world,

736
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:29,161
looking into people's

737
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:32,924
homes.
- Beautiful,

738
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:38,719
really beautiful!
- You wander throughout

739
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:41,568
the wide world,

740
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,200
looking

741
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:52,159
into people's

742
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,683
home.

743
00:50:57,009 --> 00:51:01,400
Moon, stand still

744
00:51:01,489 --> 00:51:05,482
a while,

745
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:10,077
tell me

746
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,763
where my

747
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,599
love is.

748
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:20,240
Moon, stand still

749
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:24,118
a while,

750
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:29,048
tell me

751
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,882
where my

752
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:35,480
love is.

753
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,923
- Nice, Miss, very nice!

754
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:46,958
- Thank you, thank you.
I'm so happy.

755
00:51:48,049 --> 00:51:50,483
I?s the first time they're clapping
for me like this.

756
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:53,688
- Hey, folks,
i?s quite nice here, isn't it?

757
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:07,961
...there's velvety green grass,

758
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:13,002
just winding, just rolling,

759
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:17,481
my love accompanies me.

760
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:20,843
Just winding, just rolling...

761
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,045
- Why, ïyou want to go
through the wood, Mr. Zvonicek?

762
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:26,926
- I?s a short-cut,

763
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:31,205
we'll get there in no time!

764
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,322
- Where are you off to?

765
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:42,478
Blazena!
Blazena!

766
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:44,322
- Blazena, my foot,
when i?s dark like this!

767
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:45,888
- Maybe they've gone for a walk.

768
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:47,807
- Who?

769
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:53,169
Who's gone for a walk?
D'you hear what I'm telling you?

770
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:56,119
- You had too much!
- What did I have?

771
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:58,997
C'mon, who's gone for a walk?
- Come, c'mon!

772
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:01,085
- Let me have a glass of lemonade too,
right?

773
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:04,048
- You've had enough!
I'll take the money and we'll go!

774
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:06,806
She's made up her own mind,
so what?

775
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:12,806
- Wha?s this stuff I'm drinking,
this is...

776
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:18,446
- And so I got this idea that
if I divided the cows into sections

777
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:21,005
according to their response
to a particular song...

778
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:22,682
- I see.

779
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:25,084
- All it needs is a little time
and patience.

780
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,564
I'm sure the idea's right.
Got it?

781
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:29,888
- Have you got a girlfriend?

782
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:32,079
- Well, my father's also convinced
that i?s bunkum,

783
00:53:32,169 --> 00:53:35,161
but I'll prove to him it isn't!
- Is your father interested too?

784
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:37,288
- No, tha?s the problem.

785
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:39,482
- What does he do?

786
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:43,042
Gee!
- Are you all right?

787
00:53:43,569 --> 00:53:47,278
- I was worried that all you were
interested in was this school of yours.

788
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:52,646
You're so strange, mysterious, you know?
- What ïyou mean, mysterious?

789
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,920
- Give me a kiss.
Watch it, the boys!

790
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:57,839
- What would they be doing here
by the river?

791
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,927
- Maybe they dragged him into the wood,

792
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:01,442
eh?
- Hold it, I said!

793
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:04,283
- We'd need an electric torch.
- Torch, so that they could spot us?

794
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:04,801
Clever!

795
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:06,163
- They're not going to be there,
come this way.

796
00:54:06,249 --> 00:54:07,807
- Crazy idea...

797
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:11,248
They're coming for you!

798
00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:16,320
Blast it, damned old geezer,
to think he'll disappear, of all places!

799
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:18,958
- I'm telling you, he disappeared right
in front of my eyes,

800
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:20,482
just like The Invisible Man!

801
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,806
Rudi!
- The Invisible Man, my foot!

802
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:27,521
- I want to go back to Prague!
Back to Prague!

803
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:30,443
- Back to Prague, eh?
We must get out of here first!

804
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:35,123
- Rudi, promise not to buy the mill,
right?

805
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:37,724
Promise me!
- Wha?re you scared of all the time?

806
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:41,842
I can't go through life explaining to
you that ghosts do not exist!

807
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:45,327
- But they do, I know they do!
- Hey, get him!

808
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:51,161
- Rudi, come here.
Please, Rudi!

809
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:55,160
C'mon, come here!

810
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:56,927
Come here I tell you, come here!

811
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:10,809
Please, Rudi!

812
00:55:11,969 --> 00:55:16,759
- Tha?s it - you see.
Le?s go home, c'mon.

813
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:44,888
There's going to be a downpour.

814
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,528
What about piling up the hay, Father?

815
00:55:50,249 --> 00:55:52,080
- Do it, Cecilka, do it.

816
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,405
It looks like hail.
- Right.

817
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:10,846
You want to make a shit here,
you rascal, just you wait!

818
00:56:11,529 --> 00:56:15,568
I know you're up to some mischief,
you rogue!

819
00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:18,724
- Poor old father, so i?s twelve years
since he passed away!

820
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,320
It wouldn't do you any harm to go to
church once if...

821
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:24,602
...if I've paid for the service.
- Leave me alone!

822
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:26,566
- D'you have any idea how much we owe
father for?!

823
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:29,447
At least when i?s his anniversary...

824
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:34,523
And have breakfast, the scones
are in the cupboard, ïyou hear me?

825
00:56:34,609 --> 00:56:36,565
- Sure.
- Christ, what a mess.

826
00:56:36,649 --> 00:56:40,005
We'll roast you and we'll gobble you up.
You rascal!

827
00:56:40,249 --> 00:56:43,002
You're off somewhere, you're off!
How many time have I told you, Mum,

828
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:46,126
not to take the cockerel with you
into the bed! There you are - now...

829
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:48,604
- Oh, oh, oh! Ah, this is...

830
00:56:49,129 --> 00:56:50,847
- So i?s shit, so what?

831
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:53,324
As if I had nothing better to do then
the washing and cleaning! There!

832
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,640
...If you gave him proper grub...
- You've got into this funny habit

833
00:56:57,129 --> 00:56:58,801
of taking everything with you
into the bed!

834
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:00,800
- Okay, so we'll gobble him up!

835
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:03,361
- Gobble him up, gobble him up...

836
00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:04,928
Once i?s a cat, the other time
i?s a cockerel,

837
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:06,601
if i?s not a cockerel,
then i?s the dog!

838
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:09,363
A good thing we haven't got a cow!

839
00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:12,648
The headmistress can't come singing.

840
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:17,045
If it rains, put away Granny. Listen,
don't let her get wet, ïyou hear me?

841
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:18,887
- Sure.
- Yes, sure!

842
00:58:50,649 --> 00:58:52,207
Alena.

843
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:56,126
- Raining, raining, raining,
raining, raining!

844
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:59,321
And I'll tell on you that you've let me
get wet

845
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:02,009
and you'll get a licking!
- You what?

846
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:06,366
Where were you?
I was in the cow shed and...

847
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:09,803
- I'm off duty!
- Yes, you are, aren't you!

848
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:11,647
- You're a regular jealous buffoon,
if you want to know something!

849
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:14,562
I told you I had to fix something up in
the interest of the cooperative.

850
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:15,280
- Was it in the interest
of the cooperative

851
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:16,688
when you dragged him into the wood?

852
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:18,959
- Me dragging him?
What ïyou think I am?

853
00:59:19,529 --> 00:59:21,599
- I saw you embracing him!

854
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:24,809
I couldn't have let him alone like...

855
00:59:25,049 --> 00:59:27,165
- So you had to rally your chums, eh?

856
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:29,963
D'you think I'm your private property,
or what?

857
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:32,167
I'll tell you this:
I think you're a regular shit

858
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,648
and you don't reach even up
to his ankles!

859
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:35,606
- I see!
Just like that!

860
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:39,088
As long as I know where I stand, but
no one's going to make a stooge of me,

861
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:42,720
get it? Neither you, nor themselves!
Remember that!

862
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:49,282
Well?
Have you got something?

863
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,484
And did you look everywhere?
Carefully?

864
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:54,402
And what about yesterday?
Did he say anything?

865
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:55,998
- He kept talking about his thesis

866
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:58,239
and that he had a fight with his father
over it...

867
00:59:59,049 --> 01:00:00,368
- What happened next?
- Nothing.

868
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,360
- So you used a wrong tack!
- You go and tackle him yourself

869
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:03,928
if you're so clever!
I'm fed up!

870
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:05,442
- What about us - ïyou think we're
enjoying ourselves?

871
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,719
So we'll pack it in and we'll lose our
image,

872
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,164
special bonus and all we'll have left
will be ridicule

873
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:11,284
from the rest of the district!

874
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:13,803
We can't let this happen.
- You know something?

875
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:17,807
Le?s help him
with this nonsense of his.

876
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:21,962
Simon!
- Go and give him a hand!

877
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:24,040
Let me, I'll hold it for you.
- Simon, come here!

878
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:29,444
If it fails now, they'll lock us all up.

879
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:31,128
Fiddlesticks.

880
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:35,362
- Crazy, horsing around with cows!

881
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:37,758
Stop nagging us.
- But I won't go inside, not me!

882
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:39,362
- But...
- I'm slaving like a dog...

883
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:43,845
C'mon, you're too slow.

884
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,599
Gee, no, not here!

885
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,088
Don't!

886
01:00:56,249 --> 01:00:57,682
Mind the step.

887
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:02,926
We'll turn on the tape-recorder
and we'll talk...

888
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:06,441
Gee, there are some sausages at home
with pickled onions... C'mon!

889
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:09,882
- Well, sausage you say, you bitch?

890
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,362
Get up!

891
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:57,128
Don't be mad, Blazena,

892
01:01:58,209 --> 01:02:00,006
I'm terribly in love with you.

893
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:20,563
If I manage all right, I'll stop at the
dentis?s.

894
01:02:21,649 --> 01:02:23,799
Is this fit for driving to town

895
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:26,477
and for parking it there?
I keep telling you...

896
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:28,760
I always wash it, so you can give it
a wash for a change!

897
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:32,888
- Come on, what the hell... this...
You keep putting it into the barn,

898
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:34,846
there are the hens, but I won't let
this upset me!

899
01:02:34,929 --> 01:02:36,078
- The hens're yours,
the rabbits are mine!

900
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,363
- If you didn't guzzle the beer
all the time,

901
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:39,405
everything'd be plain sailing.
- Look, for chrissake, go, go, go!

902
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,162
- Stop fussing!
- Molly?

903
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,362
Wha?re you up to?

904
01:02:45,569 --> 01:02:47,764
- Mum!
Mum!

905
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:49,601
- I'm surprised, Molly, that you passed
your driving test!

906
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:53,284
- She's not here! Mum!
That teacher must have been blind.

907
01:02:54,449 --> 01:02:56,485
- Bang, bang!
- I?s alive!

908
01:02:57,689 --> 01:02:59,566
C'mon, yes, bang.

909
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:02,846
- The stove's fallen down, fallen down...
- It sure's fallen down.

910
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:05,165
You were turning and tossing and
the stove's fallen down.

911
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:07,117
Our poor little girl!

912
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:08,961
- You wanted to do me in!
- We didn't, we didn't!

913
01:03:17,729 --> 01:03:19,208
Don't cry!

914
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:30,965
He's a nitwit!

915
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:33,687
- You go on, I'm all right.

916
01:03:35,129 --> 01:03:36,608
- There...

917
01:03:45,609 --> 01:03:47,725
I'll fetch the whip, why should I be
using my hand,

918
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:53,040
Will I or won't I?
C'mon, look at me, look at me!

919
01:03:53,169 --> 01:03:56,127
- Aniline paints.
- What? What paints?

920
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:59,804
- Those we're using at school,
the poisonous ones.

921
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:03,440
- Got forbid, he wants to poison us all!

922
01:04:04,209 --> 01:04:06,848
Good lord, wha?re you punishing me for?

923
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:10,001
How many did you give them?
- Only green and blue.

924
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:14,283
- This is annoying,
you try to get something to eat

925
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:19,438
you get poisoned by toxic green paints!
Poisons!

926
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:22,128
But I'm not going to lose my nerves with
you!

927
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:24,445
Just you wait when Dad gets sober,
you'll get a proper licking!

928
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:27,607
Poor little things!

929
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:32,848
You little bugger!
Why do you do this to an old woman?

930
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:36,120
Who's fond of you and has always stood
up for you?

931
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:38,519
Pffft, pffft, what a mess!

932
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,964
Christ, this is awful!

933
01:04:42,769 --> 01:04:46,000
Wha?re you up to again, Mum?
Come on, show me!

934
01:04:47,729 --> 01:04:50,687
Under the eiderdown,
Mum, stop pretending,

935
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:52,248
I know very well you're not asleep.

936
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:54,288
Well, c'mon!

937
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:57,008
Show me the hand!

938
01:04:57,289 --> 01:04:59,644
No, not this one, the other one!
The one under the eiderdown!

939
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,289
- No, for chrissake!
- Don't chrissake me!

940
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:04,803
What is it you've got there
under the eiderdown? D'you hear me!

941
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:07,961
- Just you wait, I'll die,
you'll lose my pension

942
01:05:08,249 --> 01:05:09,762
and you'll start pining for me.

943
01:05:09,849 --> 01:05:11,919
- Why're you yelling,
nobody's doing you any harm,

944
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:13,442
you're not going to... again...

945
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,600
It was twenty years last Christmas,

946
01:05:15,689 --> 01:05:16,838
I know it all only too well,
show me the hand!

947
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:18,965
What is it you've got there
under the eiderdown?

948
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,802
Don't annoy me, Mum!
- Listen, leave her alone!

949
01:05:22,929 --> 01:05:25,159
You're kicking up such a rumpus as
if you were killing a bullock!

950
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:27,320
- You bet I will!
She's got something under the eiderdown.

951
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:30,327
- Oh, shit!

952
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:33,367
- Yes, she's got it there!
Vladimir! Vladimir, she's got it there!

953
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:36,529
She's got a shit! On my life!
- So I've got a shit, so what?

954
01:05:36,609 --> 01:05:40,488
- Dear me, you'll drive me mad!
It can't be true, i?s impossible,

955
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:44,160
Please be so kind as,
to shut up!

956
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:46,439
What a place for a person to be!
Who do you think is going to

957
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:47,962
wash that for you again?
What do you mean I'm beating you?

958
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:50,324
Me, beat you?
I'll give you such a slap!

959
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:52,728
- I'm going to the cow shed.

960
01:05:56,649 --> 01:06:01,040
Hey, hey, you're talking your time,
mate!

961
01:06:01,209 --> 01:06:03,359
- Don't hey me, what ïyou mean, taking
my time, we all have our worries,

962
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:06,208
but I don't talk about mine.
C'mon, get into the back seat!

963
01:06:06,409 --> 01:06:11,085
All right.
C'mon!

964
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:13,362
Le?s go!

965
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:21,400
I must be dreaming!
- Le?s go!

966
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:26,438
- But this was not my idea!

967
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:28,322
- Is it in keeping with raising
the quality of the environment?

968
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:29,967
Yes, it is!

969
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:33,927
Will it help this experiment of yours?
It will!

970
01:06:35,009 --> 01:06:37,842
Are we supposed to help Simon, chairman?
Yes, we are!

971
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:41,243
Gee, what a beauty, engineer,

972
01:06:41,689 --> 01:06:44,362
nobody else has a cow shed like this!

973
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:02,127
Get going then!

974
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:35,005
Well done, sonny, well done!

975
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:36,921
- Well, Simon?
Well, chaps?

976
01:07:37,049 --> 01:07:38,721
- Eighteen per cent above average!

977
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:41,522
If it goes on like this, then, then,
i?s an award for us, chairman!

978
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:44,760
- Congratulations, Simon,
you know I've always believed in you!

979
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:47,409
I'll tell you something though,
but for our colleague secretary here...

980
01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:48,968
No, no, no, no, don't say anything,
come off it, well!

981
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:51,961
- My father was also convinced
that it was daft!

982
01:07:52,049 --> 01:07:53,482
- What?

983
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,560
Chairman, i?s not working again!

984
01:07:56,929 --> 01:07:58,999
Chairman, they've switched it off again!

985
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:02,724
- Look, a power cut again,
i?s impossible, mate!

986
01:08:03,409 --> 01:08:06,242
- Where are the fuses I wonder?
Hey, come and have a look at it, right?

987
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:32,442
Venca!
- What is it? I'm busy!

988
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:34,008
Didn't you hear me?
- Venca!

989
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:36,007
- There's something I want to tell you...

990
01:08:36,289 --> 01:08:37,961
- Look, stop kidding me!

991
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:39,762
I?s an old story!

992
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:42,803
- I'm not kidding you!

993
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:45,401
And should be nice to me.

994
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:47,682
- So what is it?

995
01:08:52,969 --> 01:08:55,927
- Here, here he is and i?s going to be
a boy, tha?s for sure.

996
01:08:56,129 --> 01:08:57,687
- God forbid!

997
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:00,039
- What?
- Well, a baby!

998
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:02,008
- You mean i?s mine?

999
01:09:02,249 --> 01:09:04,319
- Who else's?
- You bet it is!

1000
01:09:04,649 --> 01:09:06,367
- You think I'm a tart or what?

1001
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:08,360
- Look, nobody's going to make a stooge
of me! I've told you before!

1002
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:09,888
- You bastard! You pompous brat!

1003
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:11,561
I'll never forgive you as long
as I live!

1004
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:16,088
- Blame it on this blue-eyed boy
of yours who's got himself in trouble!

1005
01:09:28,049 --> 01:09:29,767
Hey, Venca, wha?re you doing?

1006
01:09:29,849 --> 01:09:31,282
- The fuses!

1007
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:40,046
Miluna!
Miluna!

1008
01:09:44,489 --> 01:09:45,968
- Hi!

1009
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:47,847
- Jump on, quick!

1010
01:09:50,769 --> 01:09:53,761
- Look, whadya think you're doing?

1011
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:55,960
You stud!

1012
01:09:57,169 --> 01:09:58,682
What is it you're telling me, woman?!

1013
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:01,283
- Let the earth swallow me up if I'm
kidding!

1014
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:04,408
Let my hand dry up and let me lose
the sight of both my eyes...

1015
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:06,161
- I know! Rather just one eye, eh?

1016
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,927
- He was yelling it like mad!

1017
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:10,921
They mus?ve heard him
in the cow shed too!

1018
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:13,609
What a disgrace, Father!

1019
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:15,880
- Kalis!

1020
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:26,245
Stop showing yourself,

1021
01:10:26,329 --> 01:10:28,285
I say you're making an exhibition
of yourself!

1022
01:10:28,369 --> 01:10:30,724
- What ïyou mean, I'm showing off!

1023
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:32,123
- You sure are not, but I can see you

1024
01:10:32,209 --> 01:10:33,403
making an exhibition of yourself
in the window!

1025
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,042
- Okay, so I can be seen!

1026
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:36,960
- Tha?s what I say, you're showing off!

1027
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:44,282
Where're you off to in such a hurry?
- Going out.

1028
01:10:44,729 --> 01:10:46,367
- Make sure you're back in an hour!

1029
01:10:48,809 --> 01:10:51,118
Hey, mate, go and tell Simon

1030
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,207
I'll meet him in the coppice tonight,

1031
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:55,722
I must talk to him!

1032
01:10:57,249 --> 01:10:58,807
We'll manage, don't worry!

1033
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,766
But please, just stop crying!

1034
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:06,084
- You don't know Venca!
He's as stubborn as a mule!

1035
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:10,358
You to explain it to him!
They're all afraid of you here.

1036
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:12,327
- Of me?
- They say, you're the vanguard

1037
01:11:12,449 --> 01:11:14,201
and your father's in the Ministry.

1038
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:16,757
- What?
What made you think so?

1039
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:19,001
- The whole village says so!

1040
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,646
That you're sending secret coded
messages through Helenka to the town.

1041
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:24,242
They're afraid to lose the award.
- What?

1042
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:25,808
Me and secret coded messages?

1043
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:30,567
Listen, if my father knew I was here,
working on my paper,

1044
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:33,040
he'd go off his head.

1045
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:35,760
I only write Mum, pretending I'm our
aunt who lives near Volyne.

1046
01:11:36,049 --> 01:11:38,085
C'mon, we'll think of something!

1047
01:11:51,929 --> 01:11:53,248
But I never got involved with him!

1048
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:54,762
- You did, you didn't,
the whole village's gossiping about it,

1049
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:55,361
so it must be true!

1050
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:56,484
- Indeed!
- Have you any idea how they'll envy you

1051
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:58,639
when you become Mrs. Planickova?
- What ïyou mean, Planickova?

1052
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:01,482
I love Venca!
- Just you dare!

1053
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:03,321
This brute,
he's a disgrace to the village!

1054
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:06,125
- Indeed!
But you didn't mind him fixing the car,

1055
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:10,327
fridge and TV for you, eh?
A nice, handy boy...

1056
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,888
- Simon's a somebody!

1057
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:15,000
- I don't want him,
he's got a girlfriend in Prague!

1058
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:16,682
- Never mind!
You leave this up to me!

1059
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:19,602
Jirka,

1060
01:12:22,449 --> 01:12:24,485
hand the bunch of flowers to the lady
who'll get out of the poshest car

1061
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,687
and mind you make a beeline for home
that very minute! Come here!

1062
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,602
And don't you dare stay horsing around
in this outfit.

1063
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:30,168
There you are and be off with you!

1064
01:12:33,089 --> 01:12:35,045
Hey, take an umbrella for her to shade
off the heat.

1065
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:44,288
Pfffft!

1066
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:48,928
C'mon!

1067
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:56,642
Hi.
- Hi.

1068
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,044
Just a moment, young man!

1069
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:12,360
Don't worry, Simon, don't worry!

1070
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:15,600
Look, I'm here to offer you help!

1071
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,807
I?s my Christian duty,
ïyou understand?

1072
01:13:19,209 --> 01:13:22,565
- Help? Why?
- In your, ehem, precarious situation,

1073
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,765
wha?s been done cannot be undone!

1074
01:13:24,849 --> 01:13:27,238
Fortunately, there is the sacrament
of matrimony.

1075
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:29,126
And the wedding can practically take
place straight away!

1076
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:32,918
In our little church,
I've already taken the necessary steps.

1077
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:35,366
And everything will be as it should!

1078
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:37,041
- Is that all?

1079
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:39,804
- What more ïyou need?
Dear me!

1080
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:45,238
Public opinion will calm down
and love and peace...

1081
01:13:46,529 --> 01:13:48,918
- Thank you for your kind offer, Father,

1082
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:50,681
but I don't want to marry yet.

1083
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:55,008
Let alone in church.
And I'm leaving today.

1084
01:13:57,369 --> 01:14:00,361
- Our Lady, can you see that?

1085
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,167
I'll never!

1086
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:17,888
Hold it!

1087
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:32,408
He's not acceptable!

1088
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:40,248
Cecilka!
- Yes, Father.

1089
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:47,878
Call the operator to put as through to
the Regional Agricultural Board,

1090
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:50,802
priority treatment!
- For chrissake!

1091
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:03,528
Hand me the fern!
We'll fix it up here with a wire.

1092
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:07,321
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

1093
01:15:07,649 --> 01:15:10,368
- Good morning, engineer!
- Good morning!

1094
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:14,041
- Simon, they tell me you're thinking
of settling down here.

1095
01:15:14,809 --> 01:15:16,322
Or am I wrong?

1096
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:19,526
- Who told you?
- The grapevine.

1097
01:15:20,289 --> 01:15:24,407
When you finish school, we'll give you
a job, see?

1098
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:28,961
What we need are young, promising
specialists!

1099
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:33,841
You'll get a good salary to start with,
a good flat, so how about it?

1100
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,442
- D'you happen to know where I can find
Venca?

1101
01:15:35,769 --> 01:15:37,407
- Venca?
- Venca's over there.

1102
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:38,968
- Over there in the back!

1103
01:15:55,129 --> 01:15:57,279
When?
- At one.

1104
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,440
- I'll be there at one on the dot.
So she sees I keep my word!

1105
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:22,800
Pair up!

1106
01:16:30,969 --> 01:16:32,402
Yeah!

1107
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:41,277
Tha?s them, tha?s them,
they're coming, they're coming!

1108
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:50,758
Coming, gosh, coming, coming!
Coming, coming, oh, oh, oh!

1109
01:16:51,529 --> 01:16:52,325
Joe!
- What is it?

1110
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:53,728
- Pull your tummy in!
- Oh come on!

1111
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,288
- D'you hear me, pull your tummy in!

1112
01:16:55,369 --> 01:16:57,519
- Stop nagging me!
- And spit the chewing gum out!

1113
01:16:57,849 --> 01:16:59,407
- If I can't smoke,
at least let me chew!

1114
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:00,968
- Just like you!

1115
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:03,120
Just like her, she must be the first!

1116
01:17:03,729 --> 01:17:05,208
Smile!

1117
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,166
Mezerova, get in line!
I'm the odd one out, Miss!

1118
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,968
- Le?s start running!
Smile!

1119
01:17:34,529 --> 01:17:36,884
Welcome, Director, glad to see you.

1120
01:17:36,969 --> 01:17:38,846
- So am I.
- Thank you.

1121
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:43,402
- Come on then.

1122
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:48,768
- I've a favour to ask.
- Sure, sure.

1123
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:51,557
- Tell me where this rogue of mine is.
Hi, hi!

1124
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:53,287
- Pardon?
- My son Simon.

1125
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:56,560
They phoned this morning to say that he
was up to a lot of mischief here!

1126
01:17:56,649 --> 01:18:00,119
- You don't say so.
Mischief, comrades, that can't be true!

1127
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:03,886
- On the contrary, Simon's been
very helpful to the cooperative.

1128
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:06,365
Sure, helpful.
Thanks to him we've put an experiment

1129
01:18:06,609 --> 01:18:10,761
into practice: The influence
of the quality of the environment

1130
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:13,403
increase in the milk yield.
Yeah, didn't we?

1131
01:18:13,649 --> 01:18:16,959
And there you are - you've appreciated
the result yourself.

1132
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,123
- So he did succeed in the end, rascal!

1133
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:24,400
Welcome.
- Sweet little things!

1134
01:18:24,569 --> 01:18:26,799
- Would you like some...
- No, thank you.

1135
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:28,885
- Glad to have you with us.
- Thank you.

1136
01:18:32,009 --> 01:18:34,807
They say he's been, ehem,
up to some mischief

1137
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:39,161
with a local girl.
- You don't say so!

1138
01:18:39,249 --> 01:18:40,682
- Yes.
- I don't know anything about it.

1139
01:18:40,769 --> 01:18:44,079
- There's been a fight, eh?
Has there been a fight, eh?

1140
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:46,322
Has there been a fight?

1141
01:18:46,649 --> 01:18:48,321
- So you say he's waiting
in the cow shed, right?

1142
01:18:48,409 --> 01:18:49,046
- Yes.

1143
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:52,565
- Oh no, not in the cow shed,
I saw them a while ago,

1144
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:56,528
driving towards the coppice over there.
- Coppice?

1145
01:18:57,209 --> 01:18:59,279
- Sure, the coppice.

1146
01:19:01,929 --> 01:19:03,920
- They were driving, are driving
in the... towards the coppice.

1147
01:19:25,449 --> 01:19:26,404
We said one, didn't we?

1148
01:19:26,489 --> 01:19:27,888
- Have you any idea how crowded
the doctor's surgery was?

1149
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:31,679
- I see. Well, if you've dragged me
all this way just to tell me that

1150
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:35,884
you're having an abortion,
you count me out!

1151
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:39,007
- Have you got it?
Show it to him then.

1152
01:19:39,409 --> 01:19:41,047
He really is a terrible fathead!

1153
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,564
- But I love him all the same!

1154
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:45,607
- Save your tears,
I was not born yesterday.

1155
01:19:46,849 --> 01:19:48,760
What is it?
- A certificate.

1156
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:51,966
- I can see that!
- Saying that I'm three months pregnant.

1157
01:19:56,289 --> 01:19:57,927
And when did I arrive here?

1158
01:19:59,769 --> 01:20:02,522
They're after you, the whole village!
Clear off, quickly!

1159
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:03,878
- Which's the shortest way
to the station?

1160
01:20:03,969 --> 01:20:06,119
- You can't make it,
they'll surround it in a moment!

1161
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:10,043
- Take me bike!
Jirka'll show you the way,

1162
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:14,001
we'll stay behind for a while.

1163
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:44,045
There they are! There they are!
Quickly!

1164
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:57,640
Tha?s them! Tha?s them! What a shame!

1165
01:20:57,929 --> 01:21:01,444
- We just caught them when...
Pfffft!

1166
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:05,322
Bloody hell!
Who are they?

1167
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:08,527
I can't see without my specs.
- Wha?s this supposed to mean?

1168
01:21:08,849 --> 01:21:11,488
- I can't see him.
- Sorry!

1169
01:21:13,489 --> 01:21:18,085
What a disgrace! I'll kill you!
- Oh no.

1170
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:20,121
You'd be murdering your own grandson
though, grandma!

1171
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:23,798
- What?
On your way home!

1172
01:21:26,009 --> 01:21:30,958
Young love - what paradise!

1173
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:42,568
Give it back to him with my thanks.
Cheerio!

1174
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:44,640
- Cheerio, mate! And come back...
- Don't worry,

1175
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:46,640
I've still got my things here!
But not a word to anyone!

1176
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:49,687
- We're not stopping!
We're not stopping! Hoops!

1177
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,639
THE END
