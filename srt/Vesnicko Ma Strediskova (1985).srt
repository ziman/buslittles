5
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,320
You're trotting about like goat.

6
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,800
Missed it up again, doctor?

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,600
- Like hell I have.

8
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
- Finished - start her up.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
- Thanks.

10
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,760
Good morning.

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
Let's start feet together,
arms extended,

12
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,440
palms up.

13
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
Raise you arms...
- Washed your feet?

14
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,280
I can tell.
Makes a difference for the driver.

15
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,600
What about the ears?

16
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,960
You always forget something.

17
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Those sails must not be neglected.

18
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Yesterday's load was cement.

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,280
If it rains,
concrete'll set behind you ears.

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
They'll have to chisel it off.

21
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,360
You should've been born a horse.

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
But the Lord changed his mind.

23
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Beneath him the beautiful distant places
lie,

24
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,840
round which the mountains darkly rise.

25
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,160
By woods encircled all around.

26
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,000
Amidst the flower-spattered ground.
The bright lake sleeps in slumber sound.

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,880
The waters rippling
to its shores're striving to meet.

28
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,240
Until at last
they marge in one luminous sheet.

29
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Only the turtle-dove does not coo forth
its call to love anymore.

30
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Don't shit yourself, cardboard dude!

31
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,880
Take these for your ears.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,880
If you wear them, the ears'll stick
to your head beautifully.

33
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,080
A pine grove rustles on the lake's
still shore,

34
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,320
Whence glorious psalm of speckled thrush
ascends.

35
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,320
A portly tree stands on the rock -
an old eak.

36
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,200
Through the green vale scattering
the blossoms white,

37
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,760
Guding the wild geese over the woods
in flight.

38
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Aren't you cold?

39
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,280
- I am, but nobody wants to warm me up.

40
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,520
- Why dodn't you say something?
- You're a right one, eh?

41
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,760
You're all smoke and no fire.
See you.

42
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Living it up, eh?

43
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,400
- I wish!
My wife had a boy yesterday.

44
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,680
We celebrated a little.

45
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,560
- Are redheads celebrated too?
I'm surprised.

46
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,800
- What's up?
- A little celebration.

47
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,480
Celebrate, with your work!

48
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
- Your mate!

49
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
- I didn't see him over there.

50
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,320
- Look at him!
Look at the nitwit!

51
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,280
That... that...
If it was stone, you'd've been dead!

52
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,040
You...
An animal has more brains!

53
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,520
You oaf!

54
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,760
Gone's the furor of that Age
which Time bore far away.

55
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,200
Far-far off even its dream -
as a shadow did it fade,

56
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,680
As the image of white citiens
in the waters'depths arrayed,

57
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,760
As the last thoughts of the dead,

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,560
The names that once they bore,
The roll and roar of battle...

59
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
That's all I remember.

60
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
Feasting on the beauty again, eh?

61
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,440
- I wonder of she has brakes at all?

62
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
- Get the rope.

63
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,520
The rope!

64
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,880
You'll come to a bad end, doctor.

65
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,960
- We all will.

66
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,360
The gate-post was one week old.

67
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,560
It cost me 500.

68
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm through with Rakosnik.
Take it from me -

69
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
let someone else have the pleasure.

70
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,840
- I know it's not easy for you.

71
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,040
But who should I entrust him to?
- I don't care!

72
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,920
I've had this millstone around my neck
for 5 years!

73
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
A saint youldn't put up with it!
- I know how you feel.

74
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,480
But who should I entrust him to?
Duda's too young.

75
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
Duda's too young.
Can I entrust him

76
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,960
to your husband?
- He'd kill him.

77
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,440
He's terribly bad-tempered.

78
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,400
- It'd serve him right!
- Have you really

79
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
flattened the Prague weekender'fence?

80
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,840
- Come on...

81
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,080
You know that...
The boy needs a father's touch.

82
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,760
You've got it.

83
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,600
You can handle him
and he listens to you.

84
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,320
- Nothing doing -
let me have Sestak back.

85
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,760
A moron too, but at least he can sing.

86
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Nobody's truck's as clean as yours.

87
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
You can't take that away from Otik.

88
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,240
- Till the hervest's over,
not a minute longer.

89
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
There you are.

90
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Here I am.
Been waiting long?

91
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,840
They delivered the meat.

92
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,360
- Who gave them to you?
- Mr. Pavek.

93
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,440
They say he was mad with rage.

94
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,080
He doesn't want you anymore.

95
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
The'll hand you over to someone else.

96
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,320
He was fuming.

97
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,560
You'll be Turek's mate - I guess.

98
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,720
You' II have a hard time!
I've brought you some shirts and socks.

99
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
You've nothing to wear.

100
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,160
And don't think,
Turek's not going to baby you.

101
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
You know.

102
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,840
I'll bring the rest tomorrow -
was too busy to wash them.

103
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,000
Turek's been known to hit his mates.

104
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,080
What's this?
Where's it from?

105
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,880
Come here, Otik!

106
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,480
Did you have woman here?

107
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,720
Come on.

108
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
Come.
Swear -

109
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,120
by the picture of your poor late
parents: Did you have woman here?

110
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Look into my eyes:
Yes or no?

111
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,080
O.K., let's go and wash up.

112
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,960
Don't go into the front parlour
too often - it gets untidy easily.

113
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,880
Clear the mess of the table yourself,
after we've washed up.

114
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,600
Why don't you take off this finery?

115
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
Let me do it for you.

116
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
That's better.

117
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,680
C'mon -

118
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
I haven't got much time.

119
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Come on.

120
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,320
A man, and he can't break
a pigeon's neck.

121
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
And a pigeon breeder to boot!

122
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,240
Dash it, I forgot
what I wanted to tell you!

123
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
It can wait though, I'll tel you later.

124
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,680
The laundry's done.
I'll bring the bedclothes afterwards.

125
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,560
The rabbit and dumplings're in the oven.

126
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
Warm them up properly.

127
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,640
Otik!
A superb film - Rumanian.

128
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,280
Have you got a ticket?
No.

129
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,640
You must see it.

130
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Where have I...?
Here.

131
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,600
Good thing I've bought it for you.
Don't miss the newsreel.

132
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,640
Put you suit on, quick.
Let's go.

133
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,000
It's partly travel,
partly erotic.

134
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,040
I'd like to see it once more,

135
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,920
but I must go to a lecture on livestock
instead.

136
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,680
My old box's out of order.

137
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,240
A bad tube, I guess.

138
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,440
Otas!
In no case leave before the film's over!

139
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,360
The end's the best.

140
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
Enjoy yourself.

141
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Mrs. Hruskova!
Mrs. Hruskova!

142
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
What's it like?

143
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,440
- They nearly cancelled it.

144
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,080
All told, I sold six tickets.

145
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,560
- Jo?
Aha.

146
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,520
Bye then.

147
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,840
What am I picking?
- Nettles, for the Easter stuffing.

148
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,680
- But I don't use that much.

149
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
- Is the film showing?

150
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,840
- Yes, but it was nearly cancelled.
- How come?

151
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,440
I myself sent six people.
- They all came.

152
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
Vasku.

153
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,200
This'll give me herpes again.
- You beast!

154
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,240
- I couldn't wait to be with you...

155
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,920
Don't be scared, Sonia.
Don't worry.

156
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,960
Just have a bang, Eugene!

157
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
- Mind you graves, raven.

158
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,520
Driving forward's easy,
but you got to have a knack for backing.

159
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
- Dinner's ready, Dad.

160
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,560
Dad, they say
you bumped into Mr. Rumlena's gate-post.

161
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,520
It isn's true, is it?
- Just eat and mind your own business.

162
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Can't eat with all this singing.

163
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Isn't it enough
to live next to the cemetery?

164
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,440
Of you can't sing anything else,
at least cut it out while we eat.

165
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,320
It's like chewing wreaths.

166
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,800
- Actually,
it's quite a wreck.

167
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,680
We went to look.

168
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,480
- So what?

169
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,880
So what?

170
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
- Good evening -

171
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,240
night, rather.

172
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,120
- Goodbye.
Well, see you.

173
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
Tuesday at nine then.
- Yes.

174
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,280
Let's go!
- Good night.

175
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
- Bring the rum.
- Sure.

176
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,280
- Why the rush?

177
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,160
- It's a PTA meeting tonight.

178
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,560
You must go, I can't.

179
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,320
Didn't get my hair done.
- To school?

180
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,480
- You go...

181
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,320
- I don't mind going.

182
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,720
They should all have their own towels.

183
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,280
Keep an eye on their homework.

184
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,200
That's all for now, thank you.

185
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,840
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

186
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,440
Make sure they dress properly.

187
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,120
Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied.
Good-bye.

188
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,320
- Good-bye.

189
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,040
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

190
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

191
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,240
What's the matter?

192
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,000
- What about her writing.
- All right.

193
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
It's neat.
- I see.

194
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,920
Gotta any problems?
- Got.

195
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,200
She has problems with pronouns.
Practise them with her.

196
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,160
Personal pronouns in particular.

197
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
- Pronouns in particular.
- I see.

198
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,840
Thanks then.

199
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,560
How d'you like it here?

200
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,520
- Quite, I hope I'll get used...

201
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,360
- What's keeping you?
- I'm just going.

202
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,000
- When'll the next PTA meeting be?

203
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,120
- In 3 months.

204
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,920
- Hm.

205
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,440
Good-bye then.
- Good-bye.

206
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,680
They say you ruined
the wekender's gate-post.

207
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,640
Is it true?

208
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,760
- Gate-post?
The whole shed, including the roof!

209
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
- Good Lord!

210
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,240
I've no mate, man.

211
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,160
He's either on strike,
or has hanged himself.

212
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,040
Shut up, you beast!

213
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,080
Otik, get up.

214
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,200
You I have lovely ears, but no money.

215
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,360
Get up, we're going for cement.

216
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,280
Water levels:
Brandys nad Labem 146/60,

217
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,160
Melnik 252/115,

218
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,320
Usti nad Labem 180/144,

219
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,440
Decin 175/171,

220
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,080
Orlice-Tyniste nad Orlici 92/10.

221
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,280
Still waiting for you to warm me up.

222
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,760
- It'll happen one day.

223
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,920
Don't eavesdrop - you a spy or what?

224
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,120
Don't forget the meeting.

225
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,160
- Will you watch my back for me?

226
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,960
- What's your mate good for?
- Nothing.

227
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,480
- Put it here.
- No jo.

228
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,520
- You brought fodder?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,680
- From Kolin?
- Yeah.

230
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,920
- A mix?
- Yeah.

231
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,520
NO SMOKING

232
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,800
That's not very clever.
- What?

233
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,240
- Putting used matches
back into the box.

234
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,720
- Why?
- You'll see one day.

235
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,920
Mr. Pavek,

236
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,840
I don't want to work with Turek.

237
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,160
- You didn't appreciate me.

238
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,560
When the harvest's over,
you'll join Turek.

239
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,160
- Me?
When the rake starts flowering.

240
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,680
- Take a look at it at home.
It may be budding.

241
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,560
- When the harvest's over, it's Turek.

242
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,440
What is it, Otik?

243
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,640
Look - Otik brought you this.

244
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,120
He likes you, poor thing.

245
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
He doesn't know how to tell you.

246
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,960
You should forgive him.

247
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
When the pressure falls before a storm,
I feel wiped out.

248
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,360
- So do I - what's next?

249
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,720
- Varicose veins.

250
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
- Look at mine.

251
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,760
- D'you wear elastic stockings?
- I do.

252
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
- D'you take Anavenol?
- I do.

253
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,320
- That's it then.
Go on.

254
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,720
- I'm serving beer.

255
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,720
Someone asks for the bill.

256
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,120
I turn my head and it won't go back.

257
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,440
- Can you turn the whole body,
like this?

258
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,720
- Sure.
- Turn the whole body then.

259
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,360
Go on.

260
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840
- I can't sleep.

261
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,840
I wake up at four
and I can't go back to sleep.

262
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
- Commonplace at this age.
I'm wakeful from half past three.

263
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,880
What's next?

264
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,760
- My joints.
Sometimes I can hardly get up.

265
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,800
- But you do?
- In the end, because, I have to.

266
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,560
- Why complain then?
There're people who can't at all.

267
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,120
- Doctor, you make light of everything.

268
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
I know best how I feel.
I'm not going to be here much longer.

269
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
- D'you want spa treatment?

270
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,520
- No, it didn't do me any good.

271
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,800
- Close down the pub
and go to the sea then.

272
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,720
- I went the year before last.
It gives me the runs.

273
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,680
- Go to the High Tatra then.
- I can't stand heights.

274
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
- You know where to go then?

275
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,680
Go to Pelhrimov
and have a look at the cramtorium -

276
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,760
so you know what it's like there.

277
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,120
Yeah?
Next!

278
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,400
Dear comrade, with reference
to the demanding plan targets...

279
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,000
- A lovely ship!

280
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,120
Where did you get if from?
- The boy made it.

281
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,720
...in the interest
of producer-end-user relations,

282
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,920
our organization needs a driver's mate.

283
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,280
- Your Honza?
- Ships're his hobby.

284
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,880
We'd like to make use of the extensive
experience of your employee,

285
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,720
comrade Rakosnik.

286
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,640
We have offered him a company flat
on a housing estate in Prague

287
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,600
and he has accepted.

288
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,280
METALWOOD, perschnel dept., Koutna.

289
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,280
- Expect Otik going to Prague

290
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,480
to save the producer-end-user-relations?

291
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,480
- Something like it.
What have you to say?

292
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,480
- Me - I'm through with him.

293
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,040
What is there for me to say?

294
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,560
- That's just it.
- What's just it?

295
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,280
- Can you imagine the boy
going to Prague?

296
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,400
Can you just imagine it?

297
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,640
He gets lost in the streets.

298
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,560
All the houses're the same
on the housing estate.

299
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,720
No one to turn to.

300
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,600
That match's not a good idea, Jaromir!

301
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,360
Terrible to think of our Otik stopping
Prague traffic.

302
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,240
To let a truck back in somewhere.

303
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,240
- I prefer not to.

304
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,840
- This letter...

305
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,800
This is the last time you to this!

306
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,360
Tohle bylo naposledy.
What's the big idea?

307
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,120
That I'd be carrying on with her,
at my age?

308
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,360
Another raid like this and you're fired!

309
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,600
This'll give me a stroke!
Co je?

310
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,320
- Just came in to ask who'll pick
the kid up from kindergarten.

311
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,280
- Granny, as always.

312
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,920
- That's what I wanted to know.

313
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
- He needs treatment.

314
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,640
That's not normal.

315
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
- Sorry.

316
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,440
- This letter did not write itself.

317
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,880
Sure - someone must've written it.
- That's just it.

318
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,720
- You look as if I'd written it myself.

319
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,680
- You didn't - some Koutna woman
wrote it, personnel dept.

320
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,720
But someone must've told them
about Otik, eh?

321
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,560
With my common sense,
it's easy to work out

322
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,920
- Now I see,
- who in this village'd benefit...

323
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,800
- I see.
You think then I fixed it up in Prague...

324
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,120
- I didn't say that.
I'm just asking.

325
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,920
- For 5 years, I've been chained to him.

326
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,240
Taught him to use knife and fork,

327
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,160
to wash, so that he wouldn't fall
under my wheels.

328
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,520
...like he was my own son...

329
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,920
...now they'll suspect me!

330
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Don't take it too seriously, dad.
- Cut it out!

331
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,160
Dancing - when a funeral's on!
Get down!

332
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,920
- Silence please - a funeral's on!

333
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,440
- Mind your business - graveyrad bully!

334
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,840
You're behaving like a ruffion.

335
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,320
Good morning, doctor.

336
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,320
How convenient
to live by the burial pit, eh?

337
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,720
- 'Morning.

338
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,960
- Shine on me the sun...

339
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,840
- And music as well!

340
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,680
The boy'll perish in Prague
within a week.

341
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,960
It's either a crazy idea, or a set-up.

342
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,400
What's it look like on the 7th step?

343
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,440
- They're there.
- How are you?

344
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,600
- Fine, but from the dizziness.

345
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,120
- As you get up?
- Yes.

346
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,920
In the morning, sit up in bed first,
stay like that for some time,

347
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
get up carefully.
- Ano.

348
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,360
- Have you still fot the pills?
- Yes.

349
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,440
- Fajn.

350
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,480
What gave you the idea that

351
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,440
the 7th step'd give it
the right temperature?

352
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,120
- Long-term trials.
It's warm on the 6th,

353
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,080
too cold on the 8th.
- I see.

354
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,320
- Karel likes experimenting, eh?

355
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,120
He's fond of trials.

356
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,040
- Good morning, doctor.
- 'Morning.

357
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,240
- How did it go for him?
- He had a beautiful funeral.

358
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,800
Give me a drink, just a drop.

359
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,560
What a lovely day!
- It's so fresh!

360
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,040
Such moments should be remembered,

361
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,080
to fall back on.

362
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,800
To warm you up in winter.
- Look!

363
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,280
Such beauties're becoming rarer,
but there's still something left.

364
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,520
Some woodland, beer's good...
...sometimes...

365
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
- I'll fetch the plates.

366
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,800
- And the girls, Karel,

367
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,360
our girls're the most beautiful
in the world.

368
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,040
The Spanish or Italian women can't match
up - they mostly have goat-like legs.

369
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,520
Did you notice how many girls
walk about braless?

370
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,120
- I did.
- Nice fashion, eh?

371
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,160
- Yeah.

372
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,040
- I'm glad it's spread
as far as our village.

373
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,200
- This gravestone artist's a pain.
Fanda -

374
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,760
your diligence's getting on my nerves.

375
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,360
- Tool busy, doctor.

376
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,320
Many cadavers, few engravers.

377
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,920
- Come and wash away the dust.

378
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,840
Where did we leave off?
- That they walk about braless.

379
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,200
- Yeah, looks like
we're not going to conclude it.

380
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,480
- Anything special you're busy with?
- An interesting gravestone -

381
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,120
with no inscription.

382
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,680
It'll be added on when the person dies.

383
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
- Did he place an advance order
for a tomb?

384
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,960
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

385
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,160
- I mustn't tell.

386
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,480
- People don't know what to do
with money.

387
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,840
He's got a house, TV, car.
What is there I haven't got, he asks?

388
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,440
A tomb.

389
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,520
Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,640
- Hi.

391
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,480
Your guardian angel's having

392
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,400
a hell of a job.

393
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,440
- The madguard needs replacing, I guess?

394
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,920
- No use, unless you got a rubber one.

395
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,120
Jesus!

396
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,280
In days past,

397
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,440
Czechs were strong and steadfast,

398
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,040
In days past,

399
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,800
"they were, for the eyes, a repast."

400
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,840
Missing your old school?

401
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,040
- I've come to ask
how my sister's doing.

402
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,440
- I see. Going to sit
for your finals, aren't you?

403
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,640
- Yes.
- What'll you do afterwards?

404
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,640
- Go to a dung college, er -
School of Agriculture.

405
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,880
- I'll keep my fingers crossed for you -
don't let the side down!

406
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,280
- I drilled the pronouns with her -

407
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,720
was it any good, I wonder?

408
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,200
Like she din't botch up her dictation
again?

409
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,400
Shal I carry your bag?
- Yes.

410
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Unusual - a brother so interested

411
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
in his sister's progress.

412
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,840
- Our parents're too busy.
It's up to me then.

413
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,160
- Hm.

414
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,400
- It's excercise-books, eh?

415
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,440
- Yes, exercise-books.

416
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,640
- What're you laughing at?
- Nothing.

417
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,520
How you're chatting me up through
your sister.

418
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,360
- I'm a nuisance, eh?
- Why?

419
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,560
You should concentrate on your studies
now -

420
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,600
and don't try to sweep older girls
off their feet.

421
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,920
Aunt, are there rooms to let?

422
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,520
- Are you my nephew?

423
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,760
Funny thing, I don't know you!
- Okay,

424
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,800
so how about some accommodation?

425
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,520
- The village's changed, young man.

426
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,120
We don't address each other
as Aunt and Uncle.

427
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,640
We use our first names
and 'comrade'instead.

428
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,800
I wouldn't insist on that.

429
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,920
The customs have changed, though.

430
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,560
Like when a man addresses a lady:

431
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,120
He stands up first and greets her.

432
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,320
- Okay then.

433
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,960
I wish you good morning.
Permit me to ask you:

434
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,440
What about some abode, ma'am?

435
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,160
- C'mon then.

436
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,700
- Do your customs allow a man to walk
behind a lady, or next to her?

437
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,500
- He may walk next to her,
of he can keep up.

438
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,600
Hi.
- Ahoj.

439
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,600
- How's life?

440
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,500
- Not bad.

441
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,400
- Yeah.
Oh, well.

442
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,200
Look where you're going,
or you'll trip up.

443
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,900
- Take it easy.
- Shut up and clear off!

444
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,400
Why're you out here with next
to nothing on?

445
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,300
- It's warm, isn't it?

446
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,800
- How come that milkso's so familiar?

447
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,800
- We've always been on first name terms!

448
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,000
- Interesting!
Where's the kid?

449
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,700
- With Granny.
- Interesting!

450
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,900
- You find everything interesting.

451
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,500
- I'm not a moron.

452
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,700
- She always goes to Granny
from kindergarten.

453
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,600
You never found that interesting before.

454
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,600
If this goes on, I'll do the same.

455
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,400
That'll make it even more interesting.

456
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,300
- Let's go for a swim.
It'll be empty now.

457
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,200
- I can't go into the water today.

458
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,700
- You can watch me then.

459
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,400
You time me.

460
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,700
Now!

461
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,400
- Jesus Vasek, don't be a fool!

462
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,700
Don't, Pepik's here!

463
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,600
Thirty-three!
- Too bad.

464
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,000
Go on!

465
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,300
- How long?
- About half a minute.

466
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,200
Please, go away.
- We've plenty of time.

467
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
- Just a carp.

468
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,100
Thirty-seven!

469
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,000
- Not bad, eh?
D'you know how long Sestak can hold out?

470
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,200
Twenty-six, a non-smoker!

471
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
- I was wrong - thirty-one!

472
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,600
- Impossible!
- Thirty-one!

473
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,100
- Watch it, then!

474
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,200
- Otik's place tonight, right?

475
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,500
- Forty-two!
- No!

476
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,800
Fine!

477
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,000
I've changed the bedclothes for you.

478
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,000
It'll be like in a hotel.
- Thanks, lady.

479
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
- He'll stay with Otik.

480
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
At least Otik'll not be so lonely.

481
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,800
It'll be for the better.

482
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,300
D'you have to paint the fence so shabby?

483
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,600
- You find it shabby?
- I told you

484
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,200
I was going to put in new planks.

485
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,200
This way, they look as if they were
in pieces.

486
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,200
- I paint them the way the are.

487
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,200
- Can't you imagine a repired fence?

488
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,900
- It looks better this way, doesn't it?
- What about the pealing plaster?

489
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,700
Is that supposed to look better?
- Don't meddle with it, Hrabetova!

490
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
What d'you charge for such a painting?

491
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,300
- Want to buy it?
- No,

492
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,700
I want you to paint my house.

493
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,300
- Which one is it?
- Over there.

494
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,400
- I couldn't cope with that one.

495
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
- If you can cope with an old ruin.

496
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,300
Why not with a decent house?

497
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,200
If you want to paint the eaves true to
life,

498
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
I've got some green paint left over.

499
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,800
- I simply couldn't.
If I don't like something,

500
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,200
there's no way I can paint it.

501
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,200
- He likes our old ruins, doesn't he?

502
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,000
- There're many things to my liking.

503
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,400
I'm not in charge of animals,
but paperwork.

504
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,300
I'm a personnel manager for livestock.

505
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,600
I've a file on each calf:
Its family background,

506
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,500
what sort of stud its father was,

507
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,400
what sort of cow its mother was.

508
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,900
- It was not our idea.

509
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,700
If they want it, just fill it in.

510
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,200
- I've been wandering about it -
I see it's yours.

511
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,000
- Thanks, where did you find it?
- You'd better not ask.

512
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,900
- Let's see about the letter
and go home.

513
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,300
- Tell them to get stuffed -
it's nonsense.

514
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
- Let's hear from Rakosnik.

515
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,300
- That means staying here till midnight.

516
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,000
- Fetch him, please.

517
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,900
- Before she drags him
out of the cinema...

518
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,100
- How d'you know he's there?

519
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,800
This game is more cheaty

520
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,300
than the others.

521
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,500
- But, Mister, it was just fun,

522
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,200
I've found more clever game.

523
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,100
Wanna know which one?
How about playing humans

524
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,300
going for a sunday swim?

525
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,800
- But how they'll get to the riverside?

526
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,700
You won't tell us who it was?

527
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,800
- He knows nothing.
He was from Prague, wasn't he?

528
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,600
What did he tell you?
To go to work in Prague?

529
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,300
What else did he tell you?

530
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,900
- Fifty-seven.

531
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,300
- What d'you mean?

532
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,300
- Cinemas - they have.

533
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,600
- Listen, Otik -

534
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,400
would you like to go to Prague?

535
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,900
You don't like your village -

536
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,800
so small, so beautiful?

537
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,900
And the little house you were born in?

538
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,200
The won't let you keep you pigeons -

539
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,300
they shit on their statues.
You don't mind that?

540
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Go now.

541
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,000
- Bye.

542
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,100
- You're making a big mistake -
you'll pay for it.

543
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,700
- What's that again?

544
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,600
- Putting used matches back
into the box.

545
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,500
- There's no doubt -

546
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,100
someone from Prague
wants Rakosnik's house.

547
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,000
I can tell you who -

548
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
this dauber sho's moved in there.

549
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,800
- D'you ever watch detective films
on TV?

550
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,400
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

551
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,700
Otherwise you couldn't say such a thing.

552
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,700
This noted painter got here
after the letter.

553
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,200
I fixed him up at Otik's place.

554
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,900
It was completely my doing.

555
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,300
Why I did this is another story.

556
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,000
I think someone else wants the house.

557
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Maybe he's among us here.

558
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
But you work it out yourselves.

559
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,800
- Thank you, Super, for your, analysis.

560
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,900
I suggest we reply the following:

561
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,100
Comrade Rakosnik is a moron.

562
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,000
He has to be supervised
by an experienced worker.

563
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,500
His mental make-up's not up to living
in town.

564
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,300
Also, he keeps pigeons,
which he couldn't in Prague.

565
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,100
Full stop.
- You can't write 'moron'.

566
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,000
I'd write 'half-wit'
- The doctor said

567
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,100
he was momentally backward.

568
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,400
- Mentally.
- Not bad - write it up.

569
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,500
C'mon, it's starting.

570
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,400
- Have they had the mirror yet?
- Not yet.

571
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,100
- I'll join you when the mirror
comes on.

572
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,000
- The American film Harpoon mirrors
that we offer you,

573
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,500
the bourgeois society

574
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,200
where the dollar's
the alpha and omega of life.

575
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,100
It was made

576
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,900
by Francis S. Jones in 1962.

577
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,200
Manhattan, 27th September.

578
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,100
- Watching?
So, I won't bother you.

579
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,700
I'll come later then.

580
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,500
- Come on in.

581
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,100
- Where's your sister's body - tell us!

582
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,500
- If I don't tell you, I can't sleep.

583
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,300
- Say it and you'll sleep.

584
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,200
- Could he leave, or shall we?

585
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
- Go and do some gluing.
He didn't want to watch anyway.

586
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,100
- Don't shoot until I tell you.

587
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,200
- They're meeting there - I saw them.

588
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,400
- Jana Turkovic?
- Yes, Jana Turkova.

589
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,500
- It's all over New York.
Photographs in the newspapers.

590
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,600
- If it gets back to Turek,
he'll kill her.

591
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,000
- Don't yell, idiot.

592
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,300
- Kaspar's a fool, too.

593
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,900
She's the mother of a young child.

594
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,200
- Where's Bradley?
Where is he?

595
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,000
He should've been here long ago.

596
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,600
- Don't wait for Bradley.
I'll take care of him.

597
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,300
- How long have they been at it?
- God knows.

598
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,900
- What's this got to do with his house?

599
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,200
- Of you no gotta dollars,
man, you're in trouble.

600
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,700
- Exactly.
I think

601
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,900
he wants to pack him off to Prague

602
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,700
to fornicate in his house.

603
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,000
Or -

604
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,700
he wants it for a friend from Prague

605
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,200
who's only spend the weekends here

606
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,400
and the mice could play during the week.
- This woman's stoned.

607
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,000
- I don't think so.
It was his suggestion

608
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,500
not to let him go.

609
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,800
- It's a cover-up.

610
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,800
- I'm sorry for the kid,
if it comes to light.

611
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,600
- Don't tell anybody!

612
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,100
- Like the tomb!

613
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,100
- They killed Bradley!

614
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,000
Hey, wait, Charlie!

615
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,000
He's been invited
by our comrade director.

616
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,000
Follow me, please.
Thanks, Karel, you're very kind.

617
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,600
You'll like it here.
Nothing to be afraid of.

618
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,800
All is managed.
Here's the personnel department.

619
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,400
But we'll go there later.
Let'go, there...

620
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,100
Good morning.
We'll go there afterwards.

621
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,400
Wait.
Well, go on.

622
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,800
Comrade director,
it's comrade Rakosnik -

623
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,600
the one with the house.

624
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,600
Will you take coffee or something
stronger?

625
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,400
- A vodka?

626
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,500
What?
- A roll.

627
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
- A roll.

628
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,300
- Welcome, comrade Rakosnik.

629
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,200
I hope...

630
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,900
...you'll like it here.

631
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,500
I'm pressed for time,

632
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,900
you'll have to see to it yourself.
- Sure.

633
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,600
- Want the car?
- Yes.

634
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,100
- Take the car!
- Yes, thank's.

635
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,700
- See you then.

636
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
- C'mon, Otik.
Good-bye.

637
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,300
- Bad habit, hand-shaking.

638
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,400
They've long given it up in the West.

639
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,600
No wonder we have epidemics of flu here.

640
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,400
A shower - that's something, eh?

641
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,400
Watch it now...
All right...

642
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,300
They haven't turned it on yet...

643
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,100
Cold water, hot water.

644
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,300
Now something you haven't seen yet.

645
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,200
It's no like in your place.

646
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
Wait till you see the kitchen:

647
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,600
Hot and cold water, a sink,

648
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,200
an elektric or gas cooker...

649
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,900
C'mon, Otik.

650
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,000
A modern kitchen, what a marvel!

651
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,900
Otiku, Otiku,
C'mon then.

652
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,200
Come on.

653
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
This is...
Come here.

654
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,500
The latest fittings...
hot and cold water,

655
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,000
extractor fan...

656
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,200
electric cooker...

657
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,200
oven with grill!

658
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,400
What a height, eh?

659
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,000
What's the matter?
What?

660
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,800
Pigeons?

661
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,600
Plenty of them - in the Old Town Square.

662
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,100
It's not so bad, Frantisek.

663
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,100
- The moment he's better,
he'll smoke and drink again.

664
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,400
You should tell him not to.
He's more likely to listen to you.

665
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,200
- If he gave it up all at once,
it'd do no good.

666
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The grave should receive
a decrepit body.

667
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,500
You'll cut down, eh?

668
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,000
A cuddly little thing, eh?

669
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,300
Very.

670
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,400
What's his name?
- He doesn't even have a name.

671
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,800
Dad found him at the railway station.

672
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,800
He adopted him and followed him
all the way home.

673
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,300
- That's a good doggy.

674
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,200
- If you like him, take him.

675
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,800
- I would't mind.

676
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,500
- Such a mongral?

677
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,200
- They're the best.
Come here.

678
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,300
An accident with the combine harvester -
they've run over Drapalik.

679
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,600
Have a look, doctor, what a sight!

680
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,200
He went uder the harvester -
- Yeah.

681
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,500
To have a look at the transmission box.

682
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,700
Turek backed into him...

683
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,000
We shouted:
"There's a man there, you oaf!","

684
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,700
but he rolled him over once more.

685
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,200
You must see it, doctor...

686
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,000
You will see something, let's go.

687
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,700
- Where's he?
- Here.

688
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,300
- What's your opinion, doctor?
- Stand up.

689
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,500
Walk about a bit.

690
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,100
- Surprised, eh?
- How steely our people are, eh?

691
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,500
- Impossible.

692
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,200
If you poured plaster into those,
he'd have a statue.

693
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,300
That'il do.

694
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,200
Bend over.

695
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,600
Does it hurt?
- No.

696
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
- And this?

697
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,800
What's so funny?
- It tickles.

698
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
- Look, go home and come back tomorrow.
Come.

699
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,300
Turn up the sleeve.
Hold this.

700
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,900
- Is it necessary?
- If it weren't,

701
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,300
I wouldn't be doing it.
You think I enjoy it?

702
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,900
You had a few, eh?

703
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,100
Keep still then.

704
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,600
All right, that's it.

705
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,900
What the hell's all this?

706
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,300
IMMORTAL DRAPALIK /PLASTER/

707
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,800
Keep shooting your mouths off

708
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,800
and we'll have the safety officer
breathing down our necks!

709
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,000
No beer out in the fields anymore!

710
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,600
Turek, is that clear?

711
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,900
- Sure.
- How come I was not called

712
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,400
in on the accident?

713
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,000
- I guess they didn't want
to wake you up -

714
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,700
if nothing actually happened.

715
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,300
- They say Turek was under
the influence.

716
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,600
You were suppposed to take a blood test.
- I did.

717
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,700
He was not under the influence.

718
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,100
He was lucky,

719
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,500
for I expect he'll lose his wife soon.

720
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,800
If he lost his licence -
that's be

721
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,300
too many blows at once.

722
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,900
- I've got my opinion of the matter.

723
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,900
- Suit yourself.

724
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,700
This is the surest sign of progress.

725
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,400
- What is?
- The tinker always came

726
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,700
this time of year -
from Slovakia.

727
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,300
Today - we have Stefan!

728
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,500
- Perhaps it will not be Stefan.

729
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,800
Maybe they'll send someone else.
- Hardly - but even if:

730
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,300
But even if:
It's a sure sign of progress.

731
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,200
- Can Stefan drink?
We've a bottle for him.

732
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,100
- You're crazy!

733
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
- He'll get plastered and do a spiral.

734
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,000
- Who did this?

735
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,500
You...

736
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,800
You lout!

737
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,100
- Let him go,
or I'll take you to pieces!

738
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,100
Let him be!

739
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,400
- Come off it!
- You me?

740
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,900
- Ouch, you oaf!

741
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,100
- Come off it, boys!

742
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,600
There's no point in it!

743
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,400
Calling yourselves cooperative farmers?

744
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,400
What is it?
- Stefan.

745
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,100
- Beat it, boys!

746
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,300
Stefan!

747
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,800
Hi, boys, how's life?

748
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,000
- Fine.

749
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,100
Reserved for redheands!

750
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,900
You can cover up adultery in town.

751
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,000
Not here.

752
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,500
Unfortunately.

753
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,900
- Does it affect the milk yield?

754
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,200
- What d'you mean?
- If not,

755
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,900
then it's my private business.

756
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
- It is and it isn't.

757
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,700
The morals of the village're
totally different.

758
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,200
- And what are they?

759
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,300
- Unspoilt.
- Aha.

760
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,300
Whose dog is it, doctor?

761
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,900
- Mine -
it was strandel at the railway station.

762
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,300
- A mixed bread, eh?

763
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,200
- What's its name?

764
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,800
- Lord Charles of the Railway Station.

765
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,800
You drinking?

766
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,000
That's all right then.

767
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Leave it at that, or you'll be sick.

768
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,800
Going to live in Prague?

769
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,000
- When the harvest's over.

770
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,900
- You're a great guy.

771
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,800
I like you.
No.

772
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,100
Try that again and we'll have it out
in the backyard.

773
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,100
Don't pour the beer out the window!

774
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,600
Look at me now!

775
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,600
What fun,

776
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,200
pouring beer out the window!

777
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,500
Hi, Stefan.

778
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,800
You've a lovely face,

779
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,100
but I like your -
er, the bottom of your pan the best

780
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,400
- Aren't you a lecher, doctor!

781
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,200
- A pan's a frying utensil.

782
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:08,900
You should know that.

783
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,500
But the other one's lovely too.

784
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,100
D'you like being taken over by him?

785
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,100
- Your sister wrote the best dictation.

786
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,600
What?

787
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,500
- Red cabbage!
- I can't hear you!

788
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,800
- A cabbage head...

789
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,800
Thinks if he's an artist
he can mess around.

790
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,300
Tell him your foot hurts.
- What?

791
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,000
What?
- To tell him,

792
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
your leg aches!
He'll leave you alone, the scum.

793
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,600
- Her behaviour's excellent, too.

794
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,200
Much better than her brother's.

795
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,200
She doesn't say 'mess around'or acum'.

796
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,700
When he clears off,
you'll come crawling.

797
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,800
I may not be interested then.

798
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,200
- And she doesn't use blackmail.

799
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,700
I won it for you.

800
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,600
- How nice!
- Cherish it -

801
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,200
it cost me fifty-two crowns.

802
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,600
- Good evening, Mr. Kalina.
- Good evening.

803
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,900
My wife told me your son wants to go
to the naval college.

804
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,700
- He's set on it.

805
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,700
- Just say,
if you need a good word put in.

806
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,900
Our director could be quite helpful.

807
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,000
- That's be fine -
there seems to be a rush of applicants.

808
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,900
- Let's have a word with him
when he comes.

809
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,900
I discovered a house for him here, see?

810
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,300
- In our village?
- Rakosnik's place.

811
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,400
- Otik's?
- Otik.

812
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,700
- I see.

813
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,100
Where from?
- From Zvolen.

814
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,200
I got married here and settled down.

815
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,400
- Were Slovak girls no good?

816
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,500
- The usual story:
I did my National Service here.

817
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,100
No the marrying type, I got involved,

818
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,700
couldn't back put.

819
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,200
- He seems to have problems
with backing, eh?

820
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,500
- Not a good idea, that match.

821
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,100
It'll backfire one day.
- Take it easy.

822
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
All right?

823
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,700
Don't go to Prague, it's better here.

824
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,900
- I must, when the harvest's over.
- Why -

825
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,600
what's wrong with this place?

826
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,700
- Mr. Pavek said
when the harvest was over.

827
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,700
That's it!

828
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,700
Where you been?
- What's that to do with you?

829
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,400
- Shut up and come here!

830
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,800
- Boys - leave me in peace
on Sunday at least.

831
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,700
- No decent pub without a decent brawl!

832
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,200
No.

833
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,200
Have a drink, Vaclav.

834
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
- I'm afraid he'll do something to her.

835
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,000
- Looks like it.

836
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,500
You've two options now:
Keep your hands off

837
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,000
or marry her.

838
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,600
You don't mind the patients urinating
into it?

839
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,400
- Have you had a divorce here?

840
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,100
- This achievement's got as far
as our village.

841
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,000
- How d'you go about it?
- An application is filed,

842
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,600
There's an application form.

843
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,000
- What about Vasek, er -
the engineer -

844
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,900
hope he won't lose his eye?

845
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,900
- You wouldn't like him one-eyed?

846
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,100
Take this to the police.
It says

847
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,300
how you hubby's knocked you about.

848
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,600
- Do I have to?
- Yeah.

849
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:07,000
Tell him I must speak to him.

850
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,000
- Which one?
- Turek.

851
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:30,300
He'll be supervised
by an experienced worker

852
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,000
He'll also be in the care
of the works doctor.

853
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:37,500
We hereby request you
to release him asap.

854
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,900
Hail Peace! Koutna.

855
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,100
- What's your opinion?

856
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:52,500
- I'll tell you something.
I'd let him go.

857
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,800
He himself wants to go.

858
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,900
Pavek's through with him.

859
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,300
We actually don't know
what to do with him.

860
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,400
I'd let him go.
- You'd let Otik...

861
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,000
...go to Prague?

862
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,600
- Let our Otik...
...go to Prague.

863
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,400
- Fancy them being so set
on this nitwit.

864
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,600
I don't get it.

865
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,900
I bet it's because of the house.

866
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,100
- Let's comme clean, comrades.

867
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,100
It is because of the house.

868
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,500
The director of METALWOOD likes it here.

869
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,800
We'd like to adapt his house
for recreational purposes.

870
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,700
- What did I say?

871
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,200
- I wouldn't be against it.

872
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,300
The farm'd benefit as well.

873
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:45,600
The'd help us -
with spare parts, he said.

874
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,200
That's the way I see it.

875
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,200
- You've not come completely clean,
have you?

876
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,800
There is some dirt, eh?

877
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,600
- I've told you what I know.
The house's involved,

878
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,800
there's no denying it.

879
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,100
- You told me the morality
of the village was different.

880
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,700
Unspoilt, eh?

881
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,900
Now you want to make a scapegoat
of a village simpleton.

882
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,900
Even as a city slicker,
I find it too strong a cuppa.

883
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,600
- He's right.
- No moralizing

884
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,400
from a destroyer of family life!

885
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,500
- He's right.
- Talk to the point.

886
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,000
It's Rakosnik we're discussing now!

887
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,200
I'm waiting for you to say
what's behind it,

888
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,800
so I don't have to stop recpecting you.

889
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,600
- Look at her!

890
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,900
You stop recpecting yourself!

891
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,200
- You're a miserable village bumkin!

892
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
- What did you say, comrade?
- You shouldn't take liberties

893
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,700
with the chairman.
- Vaclav, I ask you...

894
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,300
I told you so, Jaromir.
- I think I've burnt it.

895
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,400
- Show me.
Leave the room, women.

896
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,600
- Don't, auch!

897
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,500
- That's all right.

898
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,700
You're lucky - a near miss.

899
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,400
You will continue to function.

900
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,400
- You mean as an agronomist.

901
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,300
- That'll not be affected in the least.

902
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,700
The Alps overwhelm you, Charles.
But this here moves you.

903
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,700
Just look at it - see?

904
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,700
It's not a country, it's a garden.

905
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,000
If you have heart, you must feel it.

906
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,700
Go to hell with those chemicals.

907
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,700
A beautiful day, eh,

908
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,100
Charles?

909
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,700
The blue haze ascande
with the morning lark,

910
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,500
Till there,
on the breast of the blushing sky,

911
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,400
The carolling and the vapours die...

912
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,800
Over the still lake the mist doth away...

913
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,200
Messing about with in again, doctor?

914
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,800
- Come here!
My back's in two halves.

915
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,300
Jau.

916
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,800
Tell you something.

917
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,300
If you touch her again,

918
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,600
I won't be your friend anymore.

919
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,300
- She's still my wife.
- Sure, but you're not going...

920
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,500
But you're not gonna
knock her about!

921
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,300
Plump up the pillow for me.

922
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,300
Jau.

923
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,800
When you ran Drapalik over, d'you know
what level you had in your blood?

924
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:46,300
I'll tell them.
I'll be mean - make no mistake.

925
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,800
Hell, it hurts.
Forget driving then.

926
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,600
- She's a bitch.
- A pity there aren't shots

927
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,600
for jealousy.

928
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,900
I'd give you a horse dose.

929
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,900
Jau, je, joj.

930
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,800
The aftermath of the Brussels match

931
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,600
is clearly reflected
in the governmental crisis.

932
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,300
- Good Lord!
Karel! Ruzenka!

933
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,800
Come here!
C'mon, help me.

934
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,700
Ooj, jej.
- We need an ambulance.

935
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:21,000
Brug poisoning.
Pavek.

936
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,400
You're crazy!
- Hush!

937
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:28,000
The gear... the tube.
I'm a Lazarus.

938
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,400
Don't, you'll break me in two.

939
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,500
Karel, can you carry me?
- Yeah.

940
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,000
- Slowly!

941
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,400
Jej, jej.
- Careful.

942
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,600
- My slippers - dash!

943
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,500
- Wait!

944
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,800
- Where is he?
Over there.

945
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,800
- Help him.
- Get him here!

946
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:13,700
Jarda, c'mon!
So, what is it?

947
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,900
What did you gobble up?
- It's all right.

948
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,700
- What's all right?
- Medrin.

949
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,600
- Medrin? How many?
- Yeah, it has remained not much.

950
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,700
Can you hear me?
Who am I?

951
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:25,100
Look at me.
Who am I?

952
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,300
Who am I?

953
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,500
Well?
What're you mumbling?

954
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,100
What? Hallo!
- What?

955
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,500
Here they are.
Get up then!

956
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,400
- Come on.
- Where's he?

957
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,300
- I'm all right.
- Rot.

958
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,100
He gobbled up a little medrin.
- I'd...

959
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,000
- Cut it out, caveman.

960
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:56,000
Why, it's eased off.

961
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,000
You've put me right.
Look!

962
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,700
From the seventh?
- I don't drink from anywhere else.

963
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,500
- You've put up with him for years.

964
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,200
- That's it -

965
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,900
he's a life risk.

966
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,000
He'll say 1 word per 100 kilometres.

967
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:39,100
We're going to fetch cement
from Hradec Kralove.

968
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,000
In Beroun, he'll say: Beroun.
That's it -

969
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,500
he's done his bit.

970
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,300
I'll fall asleep at the wheel one day.

971
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,200
- But otherwise he's a grafter, eh?

972
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,200
- He loads the truck O.K.
I've trained him.

973
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,800
He's not reliable though.

974
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:02,000
Where're you off to?
- To a pond.

975
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,700
- Okay.

976
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:09,100
- He's mentally backward,
but no lunatic.

977
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,900
He's moving to Prague
because you don't want him.

978
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,500
You know that's the reason.

979
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,500
You're the only one who can stop him.

980
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,300
If someone's the only one who can,

981
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,300
he must do it.

982
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,600
- I said when the harvest was over.

983
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,500
The harvest is over.

984
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,500
Tomorrow's the last day.
I'm through.

985
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,500
Good morning, comrade director.

986
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,300
I think it's not bad...

987
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:12,100
- Quiet, Spot.
It's only some gentleman from Prague.

988
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,300
They're going to renovate the place.

989
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,800
Imported plastic thatching

990
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,100
from West Germany.

991
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,900
Tear down the W.C.

992
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,200
They'll put in a flush toilet.

993
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
What about the doorstep?
Concrete - that's it!

994
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,100
What about an English lawn?

995
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,200
Yes, we will have an english lawn.
A swimming pool to take 3 strokes in...

996
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,200
- Is it drinking water?

997
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,100
- It is.

998
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,200
Only now we have the mouth disease
around.

999
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,500
- Here we are...

1000
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,600
We'll see you about the paperwork later.

1001
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,200
Sold the house?

1002
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,900
They delivered a new car -
trying it out.

1003
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:27,800
Boys - it drives of its own accord!
