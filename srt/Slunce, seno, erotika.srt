The Film Enterpreneurs Company
DRUFIP - Prague
introduces

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,168
the dressed summer comedy

4
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:55,377
Sun

00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:55,918
Sun,
Hay

00:00:55,918 --> 00:01:04,046
Sun,
Hay,
Erotica

7
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:11,632
director

8
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:28,291
I'm sweating like a barn door...
it's disgusting...

9
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,792
I'd rather bail out...

10
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,209
She's right...give this to me...

11
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,293
...take this off...
...just let me be...

12
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,502
What are you looking at?!

13
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,294
Take something to eat!

14
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,545
Don't you have shame?

15
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,796
You only think how to show off
in front of the guys...

16
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:50,255
And she's even making a point out of it!
No shame!

17
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,381
I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

18
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,173
Is she trying to seduce our men!

19
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,549
Look that way!

20
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,298
Oh, yeah...they'll be such a nice catch...

21
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:00,508
Father, close your eyes!

22
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,216
And tell her something about this!

23
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:04,133
So why are you all looking at me?
Just look at the road ahead.

24
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,384
Yeah! So you don't get road-sick.

25
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,926
My God! They must be disturbed even
all the way in Heaven!

26
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,010
Do you see, father?

27
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:13,928
No...I don't see...

28
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,594
I'd rather not see anything...

29
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,347
Where are you going, father?

30
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,265
You don't need to! You are ours...

31
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,723
They said "all guys", Kelisova!

32
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,723
Yes!

33
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,559
No shame!... You shameless bunch!...

34
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,560
You have no shame!

35
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,852
Father, don't you dare!

36
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:53,521
I'm going crazy already!

37
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,196
The guys are hot, eh?

38
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:28,029
You bet!

39
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,947
The one with the glasses isn't bad.

40
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,573
I like the driver...

41
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,371
- Have you seen Pepa?
- He went for the keys.

42
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,122
- I want a room with a balcony!
- Of course, as you please...

43
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:04,414
I'd like to be able to see the sea...

44
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,498
Not everyone can have a view of the sea!

45
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:09,332
Jesus, here it is so beautiful!

46
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,624
Just like in Krumlov.

47
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,125
- The father... I guess, he will stay with Jozef?
- Of course, with Jozef.

48
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,625
What?!

49
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,001
I'll stay with Jozef?
Never!

50
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:22,169
With this godless soul...
...in the same room...

51
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:24,335
I don't agree!
I have to protest!

52
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:30,046
You are right, father!
To stay with this imbecile...

53
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,254
Also, certainly he must be snoring!

54
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:33,880
Well, then Jozef will stay with Kelisova...

55
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,672
There are two rooms and you are three...
figure it out between yourselves!

56
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,506
My God! Are you going crazy?

57
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,631
With this dirty pig...

58
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,549
I'd rather go sleep under a tree...

59
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,217
- Did you hear that, father?
- What's that?

60
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,384
Stop yelling, Kelisova!
You aren't back in your village!

61
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,385
Well, then, father...
...it's you with Kelisova...

62
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:56,677
...I can't see another alternative...

63
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,762
Virgin Marry from Podsrpen!
Do you hear this?!

64
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,679
Is it possible for a holy man like me...

65
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,597
...to share a bed with a woman?

66
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,097
Then flip a coin,
but mainly don't hold up everyone!

67
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,556
Please... What would they think of us -

68
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,182
We're all Czechs but we can reach an agreement.

69
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,182
Let's go.

70
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,933
Oh God, what did you put me in again...

71
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,392
Well, father, I'll sleep with my mouth
towards the wall...

72
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,310
...so that I don't make you...you know...

73
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,479
Jesus Christ!

74
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,270
It's still moving!

75
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:38,229
Ugh, so disgusting! What is this...

76
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,481
Don't touch it!
It has tentacles!

77
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,065
Jesus, what is this?!

78
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:44,565
It winked! It winked!

79
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,440
The potatoes are also moving!

80
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,024
Don't yell so much, women!

81
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,733
Let's not act like calves all the time...

82
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:55,859
You've always wanted Italian delicacies -
so here you go.

83
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,777
Now I'm curious who's gonna eat it.

84
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:02,319
What do you mean, who?  Everyone!
We aren't a bunch of hicks, are we?

85
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,528
Or maybe we are?

86
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:13,489
These are tomatoes... I know those...
...these are tomatoes, and...

87
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:14,947
...those would be...

88
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,991
Look... Look...

89
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:25,075
- Oh God...kill it...
- What?

90
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:28,576
There you go, a piece of ugly shit!

91
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:32,910
This is so disgusting, father.
Where did we come...

92
00:08:33,953 --> 00:08:35,535
Do you see?...

93
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,830
I can't eat anymore!
I'm completely full.

94
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,622
I'd rather bail out!

95
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:50,539
It's good that we stuffed our bags
with food from home...

96
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:55,416
...otherwise we'd all die of starvation!
- Sit down, Kelisova!

97
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,375
Where are you going?!

98
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,917
Well...then...with God's help,
let's do it...

99
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,460
Pepa! Don't you dare!

100
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,544
If you put this in your mouth
I won't kiss you for the rest of my life!

101
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:14,587
What a performance...
Such a big fuss...

102
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,090
...Jesus, what a pig she is...

103
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:43,136
Excuse me, madam.

104
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,806
Dear...I'm going for a vomit!

105
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,938
That's them!
The mafia guys...

106
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:27,270
- Don't say!
- We know each other, don't we?

107
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,690
How did they find us?

108
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:30,898
Come!

109
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,983
Come...
Let's run!

110
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,943
Where are you going, beauties?

111
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:43,235
...We are tourists...
...Czech tourists...

112
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,117
It isn't good to be walking like
this in a foreign city, beauties.

113
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,658
All alone!

114
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:12,325
- You need protection!
- Yes! Bodyguards!

115
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,827
And that's exactly us!

116
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,661
And now, ladies, we're inviting you
for a drink, yes?

117
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:23,203
It's not appropriate...
...we don't know each other...

118
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:27,538
Excuse us, ladies!

119
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,789
I'm Bernardo.

120
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,873
- Vincenzo.
- Miluna.

121
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:35,999
I'm Evicka...
You can call me "Eviko"...

122
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,875
Eviko...Miluna...
Eviko...Miluna...

123
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,875
Eviko...Miluna...

124
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,420
Vincenzo...Friends...

125
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,753
What can I do for you?

126
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:59,212
The usual...

127
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:05,590
- Today you should put extra effort!
- Yes, of course! Everythign will be OK!

128
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:16,468
- Jarousek has to see this...
- Only Jarousek? Everyone!

129
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,051
- So what do you think?
- It's perfect...

130
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,760
Perfect?! Filipo, fast!

131
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:47,017
So you'd like to run away?

132
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:50,851
Yes!

133
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,310
But why right now?...
They just ordered dinner...

134
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,227
What if they put drugs in it?

135
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:56,770
Drugs?

136
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,644
You'll fall asleep...they'll kidnap you...
and then, who knows...?

137
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,479
Don't say!

138
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,730
You can't know what these mafia boys would do.

139
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,938
Did they really ask you?
You're lying!

140
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,355
What did you tell them?

141
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:13,315
Well, I told them that you are the
biggest mafia bosses around here.

142
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,524
You're a moron!

143
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:18,483
So did I have to tell them that you
work as helpers at the farm?

144
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,484
Think about it!

145
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:23,359
In this way they might put the guard down.
And then you'll thank me.

146
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,985
What they think about us is their business.

147
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,527
The truth is that we could make
use of the circumstances.

148
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,028
Sure. But I'll be the boss.

149
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,403
OK.

150
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:41,155
The truth is that we could make
use of the circumstances.

151
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,948
Yeah... Blazena and Gabina...

152
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,574
Exactly!

153
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,075
Do you think we'll be able to convince them?

154
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,408
No problem!

155
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,576
Do they like us?
Yes, they like us!

156
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,993
Are we beautiful girls?
Yes, we are!

157
00:13:58,243 --> 00:14:00,827
- So?
- Miluna ...

158
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,502
You are beautiful, my sweetheart!
I have the feeling that I love you...

159
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,169
- We've heard that many times.
- Hell! I swear!

160
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:38,295
If you really love me,
you should be able to do something for me...

161
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,879
Something? Anything!
Anything in the world!

162
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,546
No, only something is enough...

163
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:45,546
I'm humble...just like Lenin...
A small thing is enough for me.

164
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:50,507
- I hate a particular woman...
- My beautiful...!

165
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,548
But you don't know her...
She is a jerk...

166
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:55,966
She destroyed my life...

167
00:14:56,216 --> 00:15:00,342
Don't cry, don't cry...
...dear Eviko...

168
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,134
Miluna, say something...

169
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:04,760
Hell...mine was destroyed too...
...by the other one...

170
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,719
- The other one?     - What?
- Well, they are two...

171
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,971
- One worse than the other.

172
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,304
So if you kidnap them...
...and liquidate them,

173
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,930
you'd only make a good deed.

174
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:21,722
Kidnap?
How?

175
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:24,556
Well, then...

176
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,516
We'll find others,
if you're so scared.

177
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,683
Eviko - let's go!

178
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:32,017
Who's scared? Say this one more time!

179
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:37,143
We'll give you all of our Slavic
charm and passion

180
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,435
when you kidnap those two bitches!

181
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:45,437
You apartments, sirs!

182
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,020
Just a moment!

183
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,938
Only afterwards...!
Come!

184
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,814
You put us in a very nice position, you idiot!

185
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,773
We thank you very much!

186
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:07,901
Disgusting violet creature!

187
00:16:08,776 --> 00:16:10,235
I still see it...

188
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:13,986
Let's thank God that we don't have a sea!

189
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:18,028
- Pass it over.
- Open your own. Over there.

190
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,696
I just want a sip!

191
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,281
Do you want to finish everything right away?

192
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,239
There won't be anything left for tomorrow!

193
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,824
What?

194
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,491
- I'm looking for the covers.
- Under the bed, eh?

195
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:41,326
The Italians must use something to cover
themselves with! I can't find anything.

196
00:16:42,994 --> 00:16:45,578
- You'll push the blanket away anyways.
- Either way, I'm going to ask.

197
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,161
Where are you going?

198
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:52,580
- You also don't have covers?
- That's why I came out - I already searched around.

199
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:55,997
It's really a strange hotel...

200
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:59,622
So at the end we'll have to sleep dressed up.
At least we brought our sweaters.

201
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:01,415
Hey... Hey...

202
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,166
How do you say "Hey" in Italian?

203
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,001
- Hello.
- Yes, Madam.

204
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,419
Ah...
Just come...

205
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,795
- This is our room, OK...but here...
- Good evening, sir.

206
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:29,088
- ...here... there is no cover...
- Ah, I see. I understand.

207
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,089
- But your bed is ready, madam.

208
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:32,840
Really? I'd like to know how?

209
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,383
Like this, madam.

210
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:43,384
So you're implying that I have to stuff
myself in there... or even both of us?

211
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:45,175
Just a moment, madam.
I'll show you.

212
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:57,429
What... What...

213
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,013
What is this?!

214
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,305
You'd like this, won't you?!

215
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,930
You wanted to see how one can fit in here
so we're showing you. Look.

216
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,848
Is this how you show us?!
What kind of hotel is this?

217
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:10,349
Excuse me, madam, but unfortunately
he's starting to get excited...

218
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,439
...This is water, eh?

219
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,481
...What are you looking at?...
Here you go, eat!

220
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,106
Leave me alone...

221
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:42,316
Are you crazy, people?
Why do you stuff yourselves so much?

222
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:45,066
As if you don't know that we'll have
a celebratory lunch?

223
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,525
Well, of course there will be one...

224
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:52,026
Just like yesterday -
the creatures dragged out of the sea...

225
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:58,153
Make sure you eat well.
We have all morning for that!

226
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:04,529
Don't go anywhere, father!
You know that you can't fight well...

227
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:06,405
Are you starting again, Kelisova?

228
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,114
Well... They show it all the time on TV...
People here beat each other...

229
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:15,199
That's in Iraq and Iran...
Here is Italy!

230
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,617
It's all the same...it also starts with an "I"...

231
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,451
So, m'am... Won't you go into the water?

232
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:28,577
Oh, yeah! So I get AIDS at this age!

233
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:41,663
Blazena! Don't go into the deep!

234
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:44,873
Just dare!
These monsters here are enough...

235
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,256
Lord...Have mercy...

236
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,715
...and save your servant from temptation!

237
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:32,385
So this is a cow farm?
This is impossible!

238
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,095
Remember not to stare and gawk at everything
like calves!

239
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,388
And if you gawk at something,
at least close you mouth, Kelisova!

240
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,596
Welcome, welcome to our place!

241
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,431
Don't say!

242
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:50,598
They really get into all situations!

243
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Well, they are with the mafia!

244
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,599
- I'm the president.
- Very nice to meet you...

245
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,600
What did I tell you - just like it is back home.

246
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:02,476
- I also want to...
- I was ahead of you...

247
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,060
Just a moment, brothers!

248
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:14,813
That's enough... that's enough!

249
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,813
Mr. President!

250
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:21,564
- Everyone in the world talks about you!
- No!...   -Yes!

251
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,856
I have to say with great
satisfaction

252
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,857
that thanks to your experiment

253
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:29,191
the "Planicek" system

254
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,526
Our farm is the best in all of Italy!

255
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,151
Vincenzo!

256
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,611
This is our chief mechanic, Vincenzo!

257
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,152
Great worker!

258
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,112
He can fix a TV, a fridge...

259
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:46,612
...and he even had two appearances on TV!

260
00:21:49,863 --> 00:21:51,863
Fix yourself up a bit and then come upstairs!

261
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:54,364
- You're going to have lunch with us!
- Yes, Mr. President, yes...

262
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,119
Bernardo!

263
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,077
This is our animal caretaker, Bernardo.

264
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:14,536
He will show you around
at the milk production department.

265
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:20,705
- Ciao
- Hi...

266
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:22,871
Please... This way.

267
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,997
Here, cleanliness is priority number one...

268
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,415
That is why we produce milk of the highest quality.

269
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:29,707
Here you are!

270
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,582
Wow, this is so beautiful!

271
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,500
If only Cecilka could see this, eh?...

272
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,292
Do you clean the cows like this every day?

273
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,418
Two times per day!

274
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,377
Hah, and we do it two times a year...

275
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,044
Shut up, you idiot!

276
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,628
"The Planicek method"

277
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:50,920
We only adjusted it a bit for our circumstances.

278
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,671
Yeah, only a little...

279
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:08,466
I really can't eat anymore, honey...

280
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:11,384
Then loosen up your pants a bit!

281
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,551
We can't leave all the food like this...

282
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:15,926
This would be a shame

283
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:19,011
Most importantly, we stuffed ourselves
with the dry schnitzels from home...

284
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,970
It's never been that a Czech villager
leaves the table before its empty!

285
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,306
Do not steal, Kelisova!

286
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,639
Big deal, father!

287
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:37,640
Should someone else take it?
This way we'll also have some dinner...

288
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,183
Wine?

289
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm waiting!

290
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,062
Just a moment, dear.

291
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,563
Bernardo!

292
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:04,689
Antonio... Come over!...Fast!

293
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:08,648
So... You got the money?

294
00:24:08,857 --> 00:24:10,524
My brothers said that they won't move a finger
for free!

295
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:12,025
No money - no deal!

296
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,151
This is the down-payment. The rest you'll
get when we get our pay checks!

297
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:20,359
Do you understand, we don't have even
a penny more!

298
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,611
When are you gonna show them to me?

299
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:25,944
Come upstairs in a bit.

300
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:28,862
It will be the ones for whom I pour wine!

301
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:31,779
And to make it sure, I'll also do this...

302
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,405
Did you understand?

303
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,327
Wine?

304
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:14,957
Hon, did you take off your shoes?!?

305
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:16,582
Just for a bit...

306
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,042
I swear, he took off his shoes!

307
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,833
You can kill a man with this stink!

308
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,001
Put on your shoes immediately!

309
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:32,420
Honey... I can't find one of them...

310
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:38,087
I beg you, please bend down and help him,
otherwise we'll all die from this smell...

311
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:40,214
Why always me?

312
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:42,506
Don't complain and do it!

313
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:48,715
As I already said, I had hairstyling for
the first time in my life...
...and that's how it looks...

314
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:57,760
Oh, mom!

315
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,760
When it's for the sake of the community...

316
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,802
Cheers!

317
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:06,720
- All is arranged!
- We'll see!

318
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:10,638
Friends,

319
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:14,097
Let's drink for the success of our
common project...

320
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:19,182
...and for your amazing Slavic women...

321
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:22,808
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

322
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,811
Is this what you call sleep...

323
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:35,852
Disgusting... The way I'm stuffed in here...

324
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:39,521
No wonder that the Italians are so thin...

325
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:45,522
Now I'm completely naked.

326
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,105
- Where are you going?
- Just leave me alone...

327
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,525
If we could only be home already...

328
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,526
Hon...

329
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,776
your golden snoring!

330
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,318
These Gypsies cry like cows!

331
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:07,319
You always have something to say...

332
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,569
How can you even live like this?

333
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,446
It's horrible sleeping with you...

334
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:17,738
It's good that tomorrow we're going back home.

335
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:20,322
You see? And I haven't yet bought anything!

336
00:27:58,665 --> 00:28:01,208
Jarusko! I see them there!

337
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,084
I don't even know the size...

338
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,210
Size...

339
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:12,210
How is the woman like?

340
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:18,962
Tits?
Well - maybe like this...

341
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:21,380
Father... father...

342
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:24,213
Heaven sends you over!

343
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:29,257
I'm looking for a sweater for Cecilka,
and I don't know the size...

344
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,799
And Kelisova just disappeared somewhere...

345
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,799
Excuse me, do you have something...

346
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:37,550
...for a regular person...
...like me... Do you understand?

347
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,967
Excuse me, madam....

348
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,259
I have something much better for you...

349
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:45,885
Come, madam....

350
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,387
Well then...thank you...after all...

351
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:54,638
Father, come with us...
He has some goods...

352
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,015
No no no! Only for ladies...

353
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:02,515
The father is ours...
...our friend...

354
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:08,558
OK! Let's go!

355
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:14,601
Here, ladies, here...

356
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,601
Thank you my lord, thank you!

357
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:18,602
This is exactly what I'm looking for!

358
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:21,103
Did you see now? We do him good and he...

359
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:23,437
Why did we take him with us...

360
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,190
Hey... Where are you?

361
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,316
- Well, where are the goods?
- Here they are!

362
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:46,484
You piece of garbage!

363
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,279
Are these your sweaters?
You scum!

364
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,115
People!

365
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,714
Your friends will not make it
to the bus today, unfortunately.

366
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:11,672
- What are we waiting for?
- Wait!

367
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:14,381
So both of them are ...?

368
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:16,382
I hope not...

369
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,300
But I guarantee that they are in
a very uncomfortable situation...

370
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:42,889
Silence! Be silent!

371
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,849
You scum... losers...!

372
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:52,850
You turn your back for a second
and they immediately kidnap someone!

373
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,315
Look there!

374
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,775
Miluna!

375
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,653
Morons...

376
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,153
This is for the sweaters!

377
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:42,737
Father, smack him hard

378
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,364
so his teeth fall out

379
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:48,656
because of what he did to you!

380
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,198
No...please...no...

381
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,282
...It was that one over there!...

382
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:56,574
Giuseppe!

383
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,242
Come here!

384
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,826
I'll show you, you scum...

385
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,661
Kneel down!
And pray!

386
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,953
And turn your other cheek too!

387
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:11,078
Father!

388
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,371
Well?

389
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:25,332
Where is the pink sweater?

390
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:35,376
They are total morons...
Nothing like this would happen if we were involved...

391
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:44,628
Because of you, you stupid!

392
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:45,920
What do you want!

393
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:47,879
They led us like idiots...

394
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,088
You thought it out very well...

395
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,464
Just look at them!

396
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:22,304
<i>My dear...</i>

397
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:26,430
<i>My dear...</i>

398
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,515
<i>Where are you...</i>

399
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,141
<i>My dear...</i>

400
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:37,267
<i>Where are you...</i>

401
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:45,477
Father, take more...

402
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:47,811
- Feel at home...
- Thank you...

403
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,103
Too bad that you can't stay for longer...

404
00:34:50,103 --> 00:34:51,937
So that's what you've done, eh?

405
00:34:55,147 --> 00:34:58,063
Hello, girls!
How did you show up here?

406
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:00,939
Can you believe it...
They kidnapped us...

407
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:02,815
...by mistake...

408
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,274
Otherwise, they are very fine people.

409
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,817
They slaughtered some chickens and grilled them...

410
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,151
...they collected some watermelons from their garden...

411
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,901
And they kidnapped me too.

412
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:21,403
They are great bandits but I already
smacked them across the mouth...

413
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,237
...But they promised that they won't do
this anymore!

414
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:27,612
- Right, young men?

415
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:30,114
What?
Can't you answer?!?

416
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:33,448
Missis teacher,
you are so good to them...

417
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,323
God will pay you back for this!

418
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,282
I have only myself to take care of them...

419
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,825
An old woman...abandoned...

420
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:42,575
...weak...

421
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:45,075
What are you staring at? Where is the salad?

422
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:47,160
Well, the most important thing is that you are OK...
I got hit on the head with a slipper.

423
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:51,827
- Look, girls! Look!
- Wow, it's so beautiful!

424
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,119
And it's my size!

425
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,536
Where did you find it?

426
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:56,454
Well, here you have to know how to shop!

427
00:35:57,037 --> 00:35:59,621
And especially how to bargain!

428
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,788
We thank you so much for the visit.

429
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:05,706
Personally, I believe that we'll meet
each other more frequently now.

430
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:11,874
I hope that we'll be able to welcome you soon
to our place in Hostice...

431
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,709
We'd be glad to come over.
Would the end of the month be convenient for you?

432
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:20,752
- Which month?
- Which one?...Well...this month, of course...

433
00:36:21,752 --> 00:36:23,419
...Let's say, on the 28th, on Saturday?

434
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,836
Earlier, unfortunately, it won't be possible.

435
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,796
It's not my fault that I'm not a mafia guy!

436
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:33,755
But you're a good liar!
So long!

437
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:35,880
Oh, the golden Czech boys...

438
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,173
You won't leave me like this,
will you?

439
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:44,549
Excuse me, please...
Where can we find father Otik?

440
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,175
What's happening?

441
00:36:46,175 --> 00:36:49,800
Some monks are looking for you, father...

442
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,718
How can I help you, dear brothers?

443
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:56,927
The bishop sends you his greetings.

444
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,802
And he sends you a small present.

445
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:04,763
To help the Holy Church of Bohemia,
Moravia... and of Slovakia!

446
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:06,680
Oh... that too!

447
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:09,513
Computer!

448
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:11,848
Com...computer?

449
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,932
Countless thanks to the bishop!

450
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,642
I'll send a thank you letter!

451
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,768
No! No!

452
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:25,393
I'll do it myself! I'll do it myself!

453
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:29,477
What are you going to do with this, father?

454
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:35,604
You will wonder!

455
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:48,273
- I still think that I love him.
- Me too...

456
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,150
So much!

457
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,989
Well, it's quite a mess...

458
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:27,617
That's strange...

459
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,034
Do you also think that you see things
which you didn't see before?

460
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,451
Or, more precisely, things we didn't want to see!

461
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:34,994
Shut up, Jozef!
You were enlisted in the public opinion committee.

462
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:38,578
Don't think that when there is democracy
you can stick your fingers in everything!

463
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,456
Don't worry, mother.

464
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:49,872
That's just a committee.

465
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,416
C'mon, mom...The comrades are here
because of you!

466
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,167
What 'comrades' are you talking about
in these days? Right, grandma?

467
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:02,084
We all know each other...

468
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:05,377
How many times should I tell you not
to give grandma...

469
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,710
...the kid's toys?
See how much saliva there is...

470
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,711
Why do you think that I gave them to her?

471
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,463
Grandma, here is one of your soldiers...

472
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,421
Eviko, write it down!

473
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:21,881
The whole yard has to be cleaned well...

474
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:25,340
The manure too... has to go behind...

475
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,757
And all of the material...
is also...all over the place...

476
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:31,716
What do you mean all over the place?
We have a construction going on - so what...

477
00:39:32,384 --> 00:39:34,092
- Material - all over the place...
- Material - all over the place...

478
00:39:34,092 --> 00:39:35,426
- Material - all over the please...

479
00:39:36,593 --> 00:39:37,802
- We have a construction, so...

480
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:42,053
- Or these...bird droppings...they...
- Bird droppings...

481
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:45,303
Oh yeah...
As if your own yard is nicely organized!

482
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,721
Of course! We are talking about
a good representation!

483
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,304
What will the Italians think about us...

484
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,889
What will they... that we live in shit, of course...

485
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:56,807
<i>-"...that we live in..."
-Don't write this down!</i>

486
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:58,723
She only erased the word "live"...

487
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:06,517
So, here we'll also have to make ...
improvements...but what?

488
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:09,893
- This is trivial!
- What do you have in mind again, Jozef?

489
00:40:11,185 --> 00:40:15,311
Here...we'll attach a hose...
...with one of those brushes...

490
00:40:15,311 --> 00:40:18,645
...we'll have a cleaning line like they do...
...then we'll only need to add some sprays and...

491
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:23,647
Don't talk bullshit again.

492
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,189
If you really want to help us,

493
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,772
then build an ordinary washroom, finally!

494
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:29,439
- Am I right, girls?
- Yes...

495
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:32,524
Washroom! For 40 years you have
been going there behind the fence

496
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:34,816
and now you start having ideas!

497
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,358
We shouldn't have taken you anywhere!

498
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:42,026
Please, comrades...girls...
That's exactly why we have gathered...

499
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:45,277
We have to think together how we can fix
everything as soon as possible.

500
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,987
Otherwise the Italians won't join
our cooperative enterprise!

501
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:53,696
Besides...Konopnikova...
we also looked at your yard...

502
00:40:53,904 --> 00:40:55,738
It's not that amazing either!

503
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:59,364
Chief! It's not me who invited any Italians!
Why should I bother?

504
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,739
When they come - I'll go home,
close the door, lock it and that's that!

505
00:41:12,576 --> 00:41:14,701
It looks like at our place only the
church yard and the cemetery are well maintained.

506
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,368
Especially the cemetery.

507
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:18,785
Well, then let's invite the Italians mainly here!

508
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:19,828
Hey, Jozef...!

509
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,829
Mayor, leave him... We already cut his bonuses...
Right, boss?

510
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:27,163
Hey, Jozef, don't piss me off anymore, OK!

511
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:29,830
What we have managed to accomplish,
we all know...

512
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:32,122
Now, what can we do about it?

513
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,165
<i>Attention, Attention!</i>

514
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:37,082
<i>A message from the local radio!</i>

515
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:40,624
<i>The village council and
the chief of the cooperative</i>

516
00:41:40,1000 --> 00:41:45,001
<i>...invite all citizens to a
special exceptional meeting...</i>

517
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:48,251
<i>...at 6 p.m. at the pub...</i>

518
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,002
<i>...Come on time!...</i>

519
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,377
Do you hear, father?

520
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,254
it's some public meeting...

521
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:02,838
especially exceptional or exceptionally special...
I couldn't get it...

522
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,089
...But it will be at the pub!

523
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,339
We don't need any meetings anymore, Cecilia!

524
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:12,716
Everything here is absolutely in order!

525
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,717
But I'm not ready yet...

526
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,342
I still need to polish the saints...

527
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:20,926
I have to whiten the altar

528
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:23,177
In any case they'll come here to see...

529
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,261
If it weren't for our Straka,
where would their "methodology" be now?

530
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:31,721
You are completely right, Cecilia!

531
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,138
I'd still drop by over there, father.

532
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:38,347
It's always worth it to know what's going on!

533
00:42:40,265 --> 00:42:44,183
Miluna... Miluna...
I also want one more...

534
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:46,850
Or better two!

535
00:42:47,308 --> 00:42:48,850
Just a moment... I'll be right with you

536
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:52,726
Bitch... She does that on purpose...

537
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:59,020
So...friends...
To summarize, I'll repeat one more time...

538
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:04,229
Every specific proposal...
or a good idea...

539
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:09,147
...how to improve things as soon as possible...
is welcome!

540
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,814
With this I end the introduction

541
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,815
and I open the discussion session.

542
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,317
Hold on... What is this?

543
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:25,193
Didn't you hear? That was the end of the
introduction. From now on, you pay for your drinks.

544
00:43:25,193 --> 00:43:27,027
And how long have I been calling you?

545
00:43:27,027 --> 00:43:30,694
You won't pay attention to the old people even
if they die of thirst!

546
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,278
Yes, Cecilia, this is how people show
their gratitude...

547
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,362
C'mon people!

548
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:39,488
At other times you can't catch a breath from
talking... is that right, women...

549
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,572
...and now your lips are locked!

550
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:45,698
Look now...

551
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,324
The bare truth is...

552
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,783
That if we don't want to lose our livelihood,

553
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:53,325
we won't be able to make it without the Italians!

554
00:43:55,408 --> 00:43:57,326
I propose...

555
00:43:57,618 --> 00:43:59,160
...to...

556
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:03,370
well, in short...to make them
drunk right away,

557
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,411
and then they'll sign off on anything we want.

558
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,870
<i>Make a note, Eviko
(just scribble something...)</i>

559
00:44:09,454 --> 00:44:11,746
"...make the Italians drunk..."

560
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:14,205
Well, there will be drinking anyways...

561
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:19,665
Look...I and Gabi think...

562
00:44:20,123 --> 00:44:23,041
umm...that we have to do something...

563
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:26,208
...such that the Italians will know that we,
here in Hostice, can be world-class...

564
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:29,751
...Right, Gabi?

565
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:30,793
Excuse me...excuse me...

566
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,918
Then let Jaruska and Vendulka sing for them...

567
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:36,378
...in folk costumes...
And I have a wind pipe at home...

568
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:38,419
Wind pipe! In these days!

569
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,046
There has to be some shock!
...A wind pipe...what were you thinking...

570
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:48,923
I and Gabi think...
that we could...establish...

571
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,466
...how do you say...

572
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:58,050
Nudist beach!

573
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:03,551
- What is this, father?
- Sodom and Gomorrah, Matousova!

574
00:45:04,593 --> 00:45:08,552
Well, we won't let this happen!
Say something, father!

575
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:11,928
Swimming in the nude is healthy!
Right, doctor?

576
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,804
Indeed! Indeed!

577
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,180
Only in your dreams...
watching nude women!

578
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,514
I haven't yet seen a nude woman, grandma.

579
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:23,014
- Me neither.
- You shut up!

580
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:26,474
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves, you losers...
Don't you have enough at home?

581
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,016
Women, isn't this so?

582
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:33,142
With this nudist beach we'll be world-class, right?

583
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:37,768
You just watch it!!!
You just dare put your foot there and I'll break
your legs, you idiot!

584
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,269
Forward to Europe! - even if nude!
I give my support!

585
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:43,936
Hon!

586
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:48,688
Well, of course, we won't go over the
top with the nudism...

587
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,980
For example, women would be able to
expose only...

588
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:56,022
from here....to here!

589
00:45:56,982 --> 00:46:01,149
And men would be able to expose from the waist down...
Congrats, boss, that was well said!

590
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:05,483
For the Italians this will be such a shock that
they won't forget it.

591
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:14,941
Virgin Marry from Podsrpen!

592
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:17,035
What did they come up with again!

593
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:20,813
It not enough for them to be...
where they are!

594
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:24,359
The end of the world!

595
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:27,840
I still can't recover from this!

596
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:32,713
- What will we do now, father?
- The best defence is offence, Cecilia!

597
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:36,120
Call up the sisters...
...and then we'll see.

598
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:37,895
Now, in the middle of the night?

599
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,427
The Holy Martyrs also made sacrifices...

600
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:43,615
And they didn't give a damn if it was
during the day or at night!

601
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:02,139
I lost my...breath...

602
00:47:02,766 --> 00:47:05,482
Most certainly they have murdered someone...

603
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,220
Girls! Who would like grog?

604
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,276
Well, we can start, father...

605
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:23,657
Do you see this as well?

606
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:31,095
You have to admit that with such material
we won't be able to enter Europe...

607
00:47:32,996 --> 00:47:35,493
...I'd put a buffet there...

608
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:39,607
...and around it...those...clocks...

609
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,803
and also...this...this...bonsai...

610
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:46,638
What are you doing?

611
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:49,758
I'm training for the junior competition, you stupid!

612
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:53,692
Hey, wait... Don't get the idea...
that you can show off like this at the beach!

613
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:55,116
There's no way!

614
00:47:55,555 --> 00:47:58,592
- Everyone will be gawking at you!
- Egotist!

615
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:03,305
- And you say you'd like to lead an international company?
- Of course!

616
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:06,754
After all, the beach was your idea...

617
00:48:08,063 --> 00:48:11,919
Who could set example if not your wife?

618
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:16,560
Example - yes! But you heard the chief - naked
women should expose only from here to here!

619
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,074
- Ah, you're such a moralist...
- What are you doing...?

620
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,835
But you... I... I can't see...

621
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,382
Are you going crazy?!?

622
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:33,329
- I hit myself, you moron!
- Do I look like a chair to you?

623
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:36,946
- You are an idiot...
- Haven't you seen in the movies...

624
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:38,263
...for example in "Emmanuelle"...

625
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:43,191
- "Emmanuelle"... You haven't seen anything...
- What are you saying...

626
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,289
Wow, chief, how did you get this?

627
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,060
Well, yesterday at home...
...we continued the discussion.

628
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,686
No way!

629
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,059
But at the end I managed to convince her!

630
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:44,304
This is... umm... Mister...

631
00:49:44,556 --> 00:49:46,309
...Mister Architect Svinuty.

632
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:50,113
Pilatova, Eva! I'm glad.
I'm the secretary of the chief...here...

633
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:53,383
- Svinuty...
- Beda...
- Svinuty...

634
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:59,017
- Is this supposed to be the object?
- Well..this is...yes, this is it.

635
00:49:59,704 --> 00:50:01,701
This is...
...from the second half of the 17th century.

636
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:09,510
Go with him...are you stupid...

637
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:12,980
You'll make it nice here, Mister Architect, right...

638
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:20,724
When did you say it has to be ready for?

639
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:25,368
- For the 28th...
- 28th of what?

640
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:27,594
This month...

641
00:50:27,594 --> 00:50:32,969
The songbird is singing, the river is murmuring,
the moon rises above the river...

642
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:37,081
Mister Architect...
...Mister Architect...

643
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:41,734
...Don't listen to them...
...and don't go inside!

644
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:44,535
Kelisova, are you conscious of your deeds?

645
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,860
You are interrupting an official meeting!

646
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:52,291
- There can be serious consequences!
- I don't give a damn about this; arrest me if you'd like to!

647
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:57,622
I have to warn him!
This is my duty to our Lord!

648
00:50:58,042 --> 00:51:00,631
What do you have to warn me about?
...if I may know...

649
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:04,442
Didn't they boast about it already?
...There are ghosts in the mill.

650
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:07,659
- At the construction cooperation we are used to ghosts.

651
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,739
Who invited Kelisova here...

652
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,691
There will be tons of work here...

653
00:51:23,486 --> 00:51:26,895
- So you say, the 28th?
- Well, we don't need much...

654
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:30,879
- One or two small change rooms...
some showers...

655
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:33,669
My preliminary estimate is...
it will cost...about...

656
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:37,698
...plus minus...A millie and a half!
- A millie...?

657
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:42,288
- My God! Such money!
Where would they get it from?

658
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:47,506
Kelisova! ...be damned...
Go to hell...

659
00:51:48,214 --> 00:51:50,878
Well, we can start with 35 thousand!

660
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:53,566
Right, chief?

661
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:58,343
Well, then don't even start with the restoration.

662
00:51:58,343 --> 00:52:01,045
Get a freelancer to paint some decors...

663
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,420
...your 35 thousand will be enough for this!

664
00:52:08,744 --> 00:52:11,575
This is a good idea, eh?

665
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,430
- Hello, grandma.
- Hello... What do you bring me, Vasko?

666
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,447
Lime, grandma...from the cooperation.

667
00:52:21,276 --> 00:52:22,614
You have to whiten your house!

668
00:52:24,896 --> 00:52:27,923
You mean, all of it? With what's in this pail?

669
00:52:28,457 --> 00:52:30,163
Well, they said at least the front...

670
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,353
And who will do it, eh?

671
00:52:32,642 --> 00:52:33,863
Well, I guess that it'll be you, grandma...

672
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:37,562
Are you crazy? Do you think that
I - an old lady - can climb up...?

673
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:40,683
I can't even hold on to the ladder...

674
00:52:41,688 --> 00:52:44,406
I can't say, grandma... Bye!

675
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:48,466
What a hooligan... Oh, Jesus...

676
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:53,787
Dear communists... My whole life they
didn't want anything from me...

677
00:52:54,934 --> 00:52:59,188
...and now if this thing collapses on me,
nobody will even notice... No!

678
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:02,783
...in other villages there's a market...

679
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:06,116
...a dead dog...
...Hello...

680
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:15,336
A market... We used to have whole fairs!
...Tell her, mayor...

681
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,389
You don't need to explain!...

682
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,024
...I don't even know why we stopped them...

683
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:22,803
You must be crazy...
What did you come up with again?

684
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:26,830
- You used to have a bakery, right?...
- Yes, we used to have...and you took it in 1948!

685
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:30,237
Us?... It was the communists...

686
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,390
I remember... I remember..
In any case, the oven already collapsed...

687
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,797
Grandma... Why do you bother?
The mayor will build a new one for you...

688
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:42,696
He - he should mind his own business!...
Leave me alone...

689
00:53:44,824 --> 00:53:47,424
Stop arguing, Krajankova!...
Stop arguing!...

690
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:52,695
You're gonna bake such pretzels that the Italians
will remember them for the rest of their lives...
You will see!

691
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:57,867
Speed up, grandma, let's move it...
The 28th is just around the corner...right, chief?

692
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:01,565
- Let's go...there's no point...
- Take this as an order from the party!

693
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:05,718
Good bye...

694
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:09,747
I'd tell on them, father!

695
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,631
To whom?

696
00:54:12,897 --> 00:54:17,038
To the Italians... So that they know
what kind of cheating is going on here!

697
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:21,954
Not that I like to tell on people...
but it's only proper to let this be know...

698
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:24,780
That's right, Marenka, that's right!

699
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:29,651
You forgot about Jozef, father...

700
00:54:30,513 --> 00:54:32,610
He was also there with them...
this do-no-good!

701
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:37,545
Yes...That's correct, Cecilka, you're right!

702
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:41,196
...J...o...z...e...f...

703
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,705
Hah! Now we have everyone!

704
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:50,305
They even invited an architect...
all the way from Budejovice...

705
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:53,337
But I got rid of him...

706
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:57,736
...because I told them that there are
ghosts in the mill!

707
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:03,174
Well, the big black dog
and the dead keeper...

708
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:04,702
You know...

709
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,386
Cecilka...Cecilka...
You have a letter...

710
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:10,467
- Thank you...
- You are welcome... Goodbye...

711
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:13,192
She wrote again...

712
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:18,439
Maria!... Maria!... Oh...

713
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:23,997
And what did she write to you, father?

714
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:28,525
Nothing special...
How the procession went...and so on...

715
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,471
...and she sends greetings to all of you...

716
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:32,467
- Ah...we are very thankful...
- You're welcome...

717
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:34,221
Is she some high-class...?

718
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,707
High-class?...She's more like a low...wild...

719
00:55:38,998 --> 00:55:40,576
Wild...

720
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:45,712
And ugly like the night!

721
00:55:46,793 --> 00:55:50,463
Ugly?...Really?

722
00:55:50,668 --> 00:55:54,526
God made the decision whom to give what, Kelisova!

723
00:55:57,474 --> 00:55:59,978
So you say - a big black dog?...

724
00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:09,054
The advancement of humanity is fascinating,
right, chief?

725
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:12,304
Look, look...It moves on its own...

726
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:14,676
This is much better than computers.

727
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:18,488
Don't get on my nerves, Jozef!
You already have one computer, right?

728
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:22,143
Computer! What kind of computer is this...
It can't do anything.

729
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:24,545
They have a computer...

730
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:26,422
They have, they have!

731
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:28,785
Lately you've become like our women...

732
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:33,481
"Chief...they have a pool"...
"Chief...they have a toilet"...

733
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:37,436
How can I buy you a computer
when the cooperation is almost bankrupt?

734
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,593
We don't have anything and you're
constantly whining about a computer...

735
00:56:40,884 --> 00:56:43,588
Let him go to the pastor if
he wants to use a computer...

736
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:46,347
We took him into the village council - so
he should now work harder!

737
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:48,785
Hah! I'd like to see how he'll manage to borrow the computer...

738
00:56:55,464 --> 00:56:56,507
Ease down your hormones!

739
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:59,567
I'd like to know why the pastor needs a computer!

740
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,813
The most important thing now is to fetch some
money from the Italians!

741
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,220
Otherwise even ten computers won't help us!

742
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,874
Yes! He should stop provoking here!

743
00:57:08,874 --> 00:57:11,249
It's better if he goes down to the mill and
paints the backdrops, lazy ass...

744
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:12,908
Let me be...

745
00:57:13,715 --> 00:57:15,577
Eviko, I have something for youaah!

746
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:20,242
That's...

747
00:57:20,992 --> 00:57:22,371
...that's unbelievable...

748
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:25,681
My Bernardo!

749
00:57:30,398 --> 00:57:34,336
...and he'd like to get married to me, but
first he'd like to talk to his mother...

750
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:37,857
...he has already bought two rings and he'd
like us to go to Nigeria for the honeymoon!...

751
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:40,894
Miluna!...I think, I must be going crazy!...

752
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:47,843
Don't cry...yours will also write to you...

753
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,693
No...he won't...

754
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:53,829
...I treated him too badly...

755
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,636
- Seem like I'm never going to get married...
- Miluna...don't cry...

756
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:02,885
You know what?...
I won't get married in Italy without you!

757
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,040
I promise!

758
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:13,036
- You are so nice...
- I know...

759
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:18,258
Travel agency?
That's a very good idea!

760
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:20,064
That's what I've been talking to you about all afternoon!

761
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:21,803
Just look at Vachoutovy...

762
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,045
They don't work - they lay down all day.

763
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,029
We could take this on...

764
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:30,952
Let's go around the whole village and offer
everyone that we'll find clients for them...

765
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,715
They won't have to worry about anything and
we'll collect commission. What do you say?

766
00:58:36,486 --> 00:58:39,804
And all summer you'll sleep outside?
Girls, leave this alone.

767
00:58:39,804 --> 00:58:42,558
Your kidneys and ovaries will catch a cold...
There's mosquitoes...

768
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,995
I baked buns for you. They are delicious...

769
00:58:45,995 --> 00:58:49,447
They burned a tiny bit
but you'll like them for sure...

770
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:52,908
- I don't know... I don't want to get fat...
- Don't worry...

771
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:58,422
Don't say, Gabi... There's no fat;
I made them from packaged powder....

772
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:04,378
- Look how well Vendulka eats.
- ...sugar...

773
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,125
Sweetie, I'll bring it right away...

774
00:59:11,697 --> 00:59:15,154
Gabi, Vendulka, eat well, girls...
before they get cold.

775
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:28,233
Give him credit...

776
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:32,027
What a mess...
...where did I put it...

777
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,702
Kajo, have you seen my red notebook?

778
00:59:35,314 --> 00:59:39,043
Yes, I'm bringing it... Here you are, darling.

779
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:42,242
Thank you. So we're set! We'll roll up our sleeves
and we'll roll it out!

780
00:59:43,225 --> 00:59:47,897
Hello girls...how is it...
Oh, theses are those "delicious and a bit burned"

781
00:59:48,848 --> 00:59:50,145
- If we're going to make it big...then...we'll need...
- What?

782
00:59:52,082 --> 00:59:53,463
A computer!

783
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,301
Yeah, you're right...

784
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,128
I know where from... The father...

785
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:01,830
Yeah, as if he's going to lend something to anyone...

786
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,046
Then we'll buy it ourselves...

787
01:00:04,388 --> 01:00:06,932
After all, you're saying that this is a gold mine.

788
01:00:07,682 --> 01:00:10,794
- We'll just hop over to Germany and that's it...
- Right...

789
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:13,418
Another useless thing to take care of...

790
01:00:13,837 --> 01:00:16,198
That's not true!

791
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:19,819
You saw how it worked for them!
Everything is programmed!

792
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,223
Feeding... Milking... Everything!

793
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:25,972
The computer will half the amount of work!

794
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:29,985
Just for a few bunnies?
They'll die off anyways...

795
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:34,200
What do you mean "a few"?
We agreed to make it big, right?

796
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:39,407
- And what will you do with so many bunnies?
- Don't worry, I've already thought it out.

797
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:47,028
Just look - the summer camp...the hospital...
the cafeterias...the pub...they'll eat it all...

798
01:00:50,321 --> 01:00:54,396
Such a computer costs money
...hard currency...do you have any? Bullshit!

799
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:58,318
Why hard currency?...
We have other things!

800
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,193
Mother!

801
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,176
Where did you place your teeth?

802
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:04,967
<i>"Vachoutova: steals vegetables"
"Jirka: lies, misses classes, smokes"</i>

803
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,326
<i>"Radlova: Looks at other men"</i>

804
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,292
The chief sent over the scouts to help us: 7 times...

805
01:01:12,512 --> 01:01:16,008
I sent a report to the chair of VRSR: 22 times...

806
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:20,239
I lent the church chairs for the meetings of MNV: 11 times...

807
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:23,910
...No!...12 times!

808
01:01:24,816 --> 01:01:27,282
Afterwards they returned them with vomit all over!

809
01:01:27,282 --> 01:01:29,206
Take a note of this too!

810
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:31,593
Exactly, Cecilia...with vomit all over...so...

811
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:32,634
v...o...m...

812
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:36,586
Is this OK, father?...What do you say?

813
01:01:36,586 --> 01:01:37,826
What?...

814
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:45,587
...Jesus...I beg you...not yet...

815
01:01:45,587 --> 01:01:48,414
Jesus Christ, what happened?

816
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,177
That's just me - your Cecilka!

817
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:54,098
Where...Where did you find this?

818
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:58,649
It was in the attic, father...left over
by the Americans...

819
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:10,984
- Mom, dad, there is a ghost in the mill!
- I'll show you what is a ghost!

820
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:13,698
Take your dinner, sit down and eat
before it gets cold!

821
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:17,129
Look...there's a light there...look...

822
01:02:17,824 --> 01:02:20,885
Right...This is Jozef - he has a light
and he's painting the backdrops.

823
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:37,407
You...you are in a bad shape...

824
01:02:38,595 --> 01:02:39,653
Come...come here...

825
01:02:39,653 --> 01:02:41,471
Here...Take a gulp...

826
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:44,466
Do you know who am I?!?

827
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:47,528
Of course, stupid...Lenin!

828
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,526
Here you go...drink...

829
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:53,897
Just drink. I'm sure that you
don't have this back home...

830
01:02:58,301 --> 01:03:00,803
Wait!...I also have to...

831
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,448
Don't think that you'll drink
everything yourself!

832
01:03:05,412 --> 01:03:06,847
Lenin!

833
01:03:07,626 --> 01:03:09,294
He took my bottle!

834
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:11,546
Where are you, Lenin?

835
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:17,217
<i>-Do you understand anything?
- Lenin ?!?</i>

836
01:03:17,765 --> 01:03:18,991
<i>-Don't pay attention, honey...
- Lenin!</i>

837
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:22,929
This must be some provocation...

838
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:01,736
- Hey, Jarus, did you understand?
- Yes...

839
01:04:01,736 --> 01:04:03,397
Tell them that these are the last ones.

840
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:06,006
- If they need more, they should go to the council.
- OK, I got it already...

841
01:04:06,006 --> 01:04:08,502
Take extra care...They are like new...

842
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:11,907
After all nobody ever read them...

843
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,090
Missis teacher...
Missis teacher...

844
01:04:20,512 --> 01:04:21,962
What is going on?

845
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:28,177
<i>Here...a book fell out...some Gotvald...
/President of Czechoslovakia, 1948-1953/ </i>

846
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:31,345
Pepik...Pepik...come over please

847
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,735
Please hop over there for Mr. Gotvald
so he doesn't roll in the dust...

848
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:41,172
- This is quite catchy...
- Jaruska, I beg you!

849
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:43,605
Classic literature - for the barn!

850
01:04:44,323 --> 01:04:46,979
What to do with them
...I'd simply burn them...

851
01:04:47,211 --> 01:04:49,882
We are democrats and we don't burn books!

852
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:54,147
Venda said that anyways they won't take them
even at the book exchange...

853
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:57,756
So before we bring them for recycling, at least
they'll serve a good deed

854
01:04:58,973 --> 01:05:00,346
So, dear ladies...

855
01:05:00,622 --> 01:05:03,111
Lesson...number...one!

856
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:05,032
The correct pose...

857
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,415
...and how to walk at the nudist beach - with a smile!

858
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:12,606
And we can use these books as helping tools!

859
01:05:12,936 --> 01:05:14,878
We put them on our heads, ladies...

860
01:05:15,084 --> 01:05:16,895
...and we take steps forward...

861
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:21,345
...we straighten up nicely...

862
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:25,173
With elegance...we bring our
breasts forward...and we go!

863
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:31,557
C'mon, ladies...let's go...

864
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,173
Perfect...very well...
...precisely like this...

865
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:38,878
...bravo...yes...
The next lady, please...

866
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:42,353
...with smiles on your faces, please,
show your teeth...very well...

867
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:48,297
...if a book falls down, no worries -
we have many more... The next one please...

868
01:05:49,102 --> 01:05:53,615
Move, move, ladies...gently...
...gently...breasts forward...

869
01:05:54,269 --> 01:05:57,146
...the next one...step forward...

870
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:17,554
If the Italians see this

871
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:20,918
They'll give us everything they have
and they'll run away.

872
01:06:21,492 --> 01:06:23,277
What a presentation...

873
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:27,073
Look how well these ladies learned to do it...

874
01:06:35,595 --> 01:06:37,791
Why not...it's in their blood!

875
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:57,109
Honey, what is he saying?...

876
01:07:01,238 --> 01:07:02,333
Yes yes yes...

877
01:07:03,678 --> 01:07:06,223
Honey, isn't this too small for such a price?

878
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:12,298
- Well yeah...I hope that all the bunnies will fit in there.
- Don't worry. Everything is OK.

879
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,662
Won't it speak German?
We won't understand crap then...

880
01:07:19,379 --> 01:07:21,858
How are you going to pay?
In cash or with a check?

881
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:24,290
With gold!

882
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:41,207
- Yes...but...
- What do you mean "but"?!?

883
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,958
Is this gold - yes it is!

884
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:45,748
So make the calculations faster because
we don't have all day!

885
01:07:48,387 --> 01:07:50,830
- This not enough...
- Not enough???

886
01:07:52,057 --> 01:07:54,307
When have you seen so much gold at once?

887
01:07:54,526 --> 01:07:58,229
And these are teeth from my dad...
from the time of Austro-Hungaria...

888
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,133
And the kind of gold they used to have back then!
Not like the one now!

889
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:07,506
You will have to top it up...

890
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:09,926
Top it up?!?

891
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:13,335
I'd like to know what kind of money he's asking for this junk!

892
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:19,876
Eight "Gotvald"! /800 Czech crowns/

893
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,054
25 "Gotvald"...

894
01:08:31,243 --> 01:08:33,054
125 Deutschmarks...

895
01:08:33,388 --> 01:08:36,097
What??? You said 125?

896
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:40,082
This is much more, dear German!

897
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,987
You know... 1 "Gotvald" is 5 Deutschmarks...

898
01:08:43,488 --> 01:08:48,640
Not 5! It's 8!
I know that very well!

899
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:53,075
Our friends from the pig farm went to Austria
last week and they gave them 8!

900
01:08:53,603 --> 01:08:56,744
Eight! Do you understand?
We aren't any tricksters!

901
01:08:57,077 --> 01:08:58,250
How do you say this in German?

902
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:03,123
We are honest villagers from Hostice!
Do you understand?

903
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,989
Eight!!!

904
01:09:13,184 --> 01:09:16,776
This is what I call talent ...
As if it's alive...

905
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:21,129
Well, you see...So many years it didn't
work out and now, all of the sudden...

906
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:27,847
- And whose are those?
- What do I know...

907
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,708
Those are ours! And they like it here very much!

908
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,679
Next year they'll come over again.

909
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:42,808
If things go on like this, soon we won't be
able to understand anyone...

910
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,492
Do I have to study German at this age!

911
01:09:46,138 --> 01:09:48,334
Chief, it's so good that everything will be ready...

912
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:50,740
...before my Bernardo arrives!

913
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:55,767
- Well...what day is today?
- Tuesday!
- ...we have to do...

914
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:02,139
Has to be cut down...

915
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,246
- We went to...to...
- I know, I know...

916
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:14,958
In Munich.

917
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:23,445
Don't press so hard...
it can break!

918
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,821
- Did you wash your hands?
- Let me be at last!

919
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:29,538
Do you see? ... now it disappeared...

920
01:10:29,838 --> 01:10:32,399
I told you not to let him use it!
He'll break it?

921
01:10:32,632 --> 01:10:34,004
By the way, it's very easy!

922
01:10:34,004 --> 01:10:35,756
At school we play super games on it.

923
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:38,780
You play games with such an expensive machine?

924
01:10:39,095 --> 01:10:41,906
Don't you ever think about it at home!
I'll have to break your arms!

925
01:10:42,812 --> 01:10:46,895
- Look, there's a little window...
- I see that too, but what to do with it?

926
01:10:47,651 --> 01:10:50,308
It's spelled out...press "RETURN" and go on...

927
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,309
I knew it that it'll be in German...

928
01:10:52,557 --> 01:10:55,079
Do you know how to say "bunny" in German?

929
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:03,660
Yes, that's it...now you can use it as a typewriter...

930
01:11:07,587 --> 01:11:10,912
Dad...you made a spelling error...

931
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:15,319
Oh my God! You spell "male" with an 'i'!

932
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:21,111
Well, what? Try to spell it with a 'y'!
It's even more stupid!

933
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:24,797
Can't you remember how to spell...

934
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,966
Which one is the the word "male"?

935
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:33,457
Here!

936
01:11:33,812 --> 01:11:36,387
Have you ever seen a "male" with a sticking out 'I'?

937
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:40,340
Cover it... They don't need to know that we
have a computer!

938
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,431
- Why...it's not like we've stolen it...
- They don't need to know! ...Come in!

939
01:11:45,025 --> 01:11:45,993
Hello.

940
01:11:47,013 --> 01:11:48,138
Hello...

941
01:11:48,497 --> 01:11:51,584
I just drop by for a bit...seeing that
you came back from Germany...

942
01:11:52,197 --> 01:11:54,782
So I wanted to ask you if you'd be
interested in signing a contract

943
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:56,929
with our travel agency "Sun city"...

944
01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:01,096
- What contracts?
- Well, if you'd like to rent out your house for the summer.

945
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:04,577
- To Germans...French...foreigners...
- We'll need to think about it!

946
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:08,341
- 40 Deutschmarks per day! 75% of the people already signed up...

947
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:11,077
And the chief too, right?

948
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,583
"Sun city" is completely reliable...

949
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:18,491
We took over the accommodation logistics for the
visit of the Italians...

950
01:12:18,854 --> 01:12:21,676
We'll accommodate the Italians
at the houses of our clients...

951
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,661
And then there will be foreigners...not too many...

952
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,893
And during this time we'll have to leave
in the attic or what?

953
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:31,015
We can stay down at the river in a tent...
See how well off Vachoutovy are now...

954
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:34,483
Precisely! And they don't even speak a word of German!
...Do tell!

955
01:12:34,699 --> 01:12:38,150
You don't need to touch anything.
Just let the visitors use the house.

956
01:12:38,651 --> 01:12:40,718
The most important thing is to make them feel like home.

957
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:46,849
Well...we can clean up...whiten the walls,
put some flowers on the sills and that's it.

958
01:12:47,107 --> 01:12:48,778
During the summer at the river it's warm...
We'll survive a few weeks.

959
01:12:49,977 --> 01:12:52,750
Of course! If others can, why not us!

960
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,237
Show us... Where do we need to sign...

961
01:13:12,118 --> 01:13:16,290
Cecilia!...Oh God!...Where did you get this beast...

962
01:13:16,568 --> 01:13:19,875
I already told you that I arranged for something...

963
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,625
Jeremiaska from Samot let me borrow him...

964
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:29,934
- He can eat a whole person!
- Nonsense, father...after all, he's still a puppy...

965
01:13:30,342 --> 01:13:32,713
Puppy...Cecilka...get him off...

966
01:13:36,776 --> 01:13:39,007
Someone can really get a stroke!

967
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:43,341
That's right! He can also howl...

968
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:47,320
C'mon, darling, howl a bit...howl...right...

969
01:13:50,674 --> 01:13:52,765
Is this a howl, Cecilia...

970
01:13:53,202 --> 01:13:56,967
You need to howl for real...from deep inside...

971
01:14:05,728 --> 01:14:09,165
Not so high...it has to be deep...

972
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:17,457
Oh my God...They don't even know where
they put me...

973
01:14:17,709 --> 01:14:20,693
...I want back down...I'm afraid...

974
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:24,332
What are you afraid of, grandma,
all of us are here...

975
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,704
This is only a dry run...

976
01:14:27,704 --> 01:14:29,580
To see if we can survive the real thing...

977
01:14:30,139 --> 01:14:32,942
Tomorrow we'll stay in the tent at the river
...only for a few days...

978
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:37,909
And then all of us will feel very well...
Do you understand?

979
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:42,260
- I'm afraid...I'm afraid...I'll run away...
- Where would you run away?

980
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:45,475
You should be happy, mother,
that we took you out in fresh air...

981
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:51,254
Do you hear it too? It's very strange...

982
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:52,753
These are the village dogs...

983
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:55,064
...the village dogs...
They howl at the moon...

984
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:57,146
But it's quite weird...

985
01:15:00,736 --> 01:15:03,097
Hah, I can't help it but I feel
now we are like during the war...

986
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:07,785
During the war you won't be able to eat like a pig...
Give me some bread for mother.

987
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:13,671
Mother!... Jesus...
...where did she go again!

988
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:19,305
Mother, where did you crawl again?

989
01:15:19,889 --> 01:15:22,169
One has to go crazy from this!

990
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:27,454
Oh Jesus! My back...

991
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:37,076
- This is the dog from the mill
- It'd be better if it had already eaten you...

992
01:15:37,076 --> 01:15:39,448
But, really, it's quite strange...
Don't you hear?

993
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,986
What's happening!

994
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:48,211
Ungodly powers!...
An earthly creature cannot howl like this!

995
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:52,304
Father!...Father!...Jesus!

996
01:15:55,607 --> 01:15:59,115
- Father! Father!
- This is Marenka...

997
01:15:59,611 --> 01:16:01,977
Something must have happened again...

998
01:16:03,352 --> 01:16:06,454
Father! Open the door!

999
01:16:07,952 --> 01:16:11,358
- What's going on, Kelisova?
- Open the door... Father...

1000
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:15,279
There is a real ghost in the mill!

1001
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,965
Nonsense, woman!
There are no ghosts!

1002
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,350
Marenka...

1003
01:16:32,114 --> 01:16:34,440
This isn't normal.

1004
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:38,563
Men! Let's go!

1005
01:16:59,926 --> 01:17:04,738
- Hey...Look!
- Be quiet...you'll scare them away...

1006
01:17:09,863 --> 01:17:13,934
These are very nice ghosts!

1007
01:17:48,933 --> 01:17:50,572
These are the girls from the village!

1008
01:17:50,572 --> 01:17:53,399
- Irina!...
- Anka! This is our Anka...

1009
01:17:54,227 --> 01:17:58,054
Come, I'll spank you well! Go home immediately...

1010
01:18:03,852 --> 01:18:06,048
Is this a mask or what?

1011
01:18:22,669 --> 01:18:25,404
I was going to die, father...

1012
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:30,353
Take this... And both of you should drink it...

1013
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,907
Where do you keep your medicine for sweating?

1014
01:18:34,279 --> 01:18:38,162
There...behind the glass...
...below the little Saint Teresa...

1015
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:48,409
- If you could only see that, father...
- What?

1016
01:18:49,844 --> 01:18:55,123
The blond one...
An exact copy of my deceased Alois...

1017
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,372
- Bless you.
- That's true...

1018
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:08,947
- Where should I put it?...Here?...
- Over there...behind that...

1019
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:16,693
Do you think this is a pedestrian zone?
Stop running around...

1020
01:19:21,628 --> 01:19:23,377
What did you bring?

1021
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:25,927
And why are you putting it up in front of our tent?

1022
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,935
It's been decided that the beach will be here,
so what can I do?

1023
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:33,458
- I'm just carrying out the orders...
- What orders are you talking about...

1024
01:19:33,843 --> 01:19:35,935
This is owned by the cooperation!

1025
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:38,684
Be happy that we leave you here.

1026
01:19:38,993 --> 01:19:41,369
And on top of that for free!

1027
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,764
People!

1028
01:19:45,764 --> 01:19:49,311
Don't worry, you can stay here!
But there is one condition...

1029
01:19:49,644 --> 01:19:52,423
You all must be naked...
That's what's written here!

1030
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:57,341
- Jesus, he must be crazy...
- Who do you think is crazy?

1031
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:59,798
First you voted for it...

1032
01:20:00,343 --> 01:20:01,234
...then you signed it...

1033
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:02,359
...so here you go!

1034
01:20:02,682 --> 01:20:06,289
You chased one out of one's house,
now he's rolling on the ground like a thug

1035
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:09,335
and at the end you want us to be naked!

1036
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,679
What's the big deal? This is completely
normal, isn't it?

1037
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,395
- Here everyone thinks like 100 years backward...
- Jesus! Mom, did you see that?

1038
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:21,815
Did you see, girls?
It's not a problem at all.

1039
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:26,358
As for me, I'll take off my clothes right away!
There's nothing I can be ashamed of!

1040
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:41,687
Now mom, if you go ahead as well
I'll end up in the hospital!

1041
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:45,435
- The healthy body builds the healthy spirit, dear ladies.
- Doctor... you too?

1042
01:20:56,242 --> 01:21:00,073
I haven't undressed in front of so many
men in my whole life, dear!

1043
01:21:00,351 --> 01:21:03,070
So what? Big deal! Look around.

1044
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:19,108
Oh Jesus!
Sodom and Gomorrah!

1045
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:25,180
- What's going on here?
- Honey, everybody got crazy...

1046
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,400
Everyone is going around naked
and they want us to be naked too...

1047
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:32,365
C'mon, don't cry...

1048
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:37,097
If that's the deal - then we'll move
our stuff behind the postings!

1049
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:39,298
Over there it's not required anymore.

1050
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:43,674
Well, honey...
That was an awesome idea!

1051
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:50,368
You're an idiot!

1052
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:04,931
Father!...Father!...It's happening!

1053
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:10,123
Father!...Father!...It's happening, father...

1054
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:13,624
- Father! ...It's happening!...
- What's happening, Kelisova?

1055
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:15,246
- Father!
- What?

1056
01:22:15,707 --> 01:22:18,956
- Sodom and Gomorrah! Everyone is getting naked!
- No!

1057
01:22:19,244 --> 01:22:23,963
- Men and women, all of them... completely nude.
- Fast, Kelisova!

1058
01:22:29,637 --> 01:22:31,459
Get on!

1059
01:22:34,901 --> 01:22:38,881
- I feel young again, father.
- Yes...yes...

1060
01:23:00,798 --> 01:23:02,700
Attention!
This is a notice!

1061
01:23:03,017 --> 01:23:07,401
All participants in the training for the
nudist beach

1062
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:11,213
Please go immediately for a
general rehearsal at the mill!

1063
01:23:11,592 --> 01:23:12,681
I repeat...

1064
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:17,777
The participants in the nudist training
should go immediately to the mill!

1065
01:23:26,729 --> 01:23:29,540
I'm very curious who will go there fist...
It's not going to be me!

1066
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:32,914
Hah, you...Nobody sends you there anyways...

1067
01:23:36,768 --> 01:23:40,487
Women! I'm not going to be the first one!
- Me neither...Show me, what do you have there?

1068
01:23:40,487 --> 01:23:42,348
This is for the aerobics.

1069
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:46,188
I said that I'm going to help out,
I'm going to cook and bake...

1070
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,329
But I'm not going to be running around nude!

1071
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,262
- We're here for the Italians...
- But the whole village is full of gawkers!

1072
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:55,776
My God, women! You practised for so long
at the barn...

1073
01:23:55,982 --> 01:23:58,428
...and now you start to make problems!

1074
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:02,881
Didn't you have a training!
You already practised...

1075
01:24:03,863 --> 01:24:08,521
- Yes, but we weren't nude then.
- Well, and now you will be! So what?

1076
01:24:09,517 --> 01:24:12,153
Girls...Girls...Be quiet!

1077
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,608
Let's see, how did we practice?...Get ready...

1078
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:18,980
...with a smile...let us show the world

1079
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:21,759
...that even a simple Czech woman...

1080
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:23,226
...can act like a...

1081
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:25,193
...lady!

1082
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,713
Ladies! You won't impress any Italians
with your pitchforks!

1083
01:24:29,347 --> 01:24:31,994
Girls, I'm going home!
There's younger girls; they can show off.

1084
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:36,650
No way!
That's not according to our agreement!

1085
01:24:37,801 --> 01:24:40,024
Stop, women! Don't act like this...

1086
01:24:40,024 --> 01:24:42,315
There will be bonuses for this,
so what's the big deal?

1087
01:24:47,367 --> 01:24:52,090
What's your problem? Until now
everyone was getting naked and nobody cared.

1088
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:55,332
We didn't agree to this!
Gabi, don't you dare!

1089
01:24:56,518 --> 01:24:58,982
If you don't stop this, I'll get a divorce!

1090
01:24:59,212 --> 01:25:02,047
Did you see this hog? He makes us do it,
but he won't let his wife do it!

1091
01:25:02,525 --> 01:25:05,605
- He should get nude! Yes!
- Why me?

1092
01:25:06,024 --> 01:25:10,175
Are you crazy?
...People...people!...Help!

1093
01:25:10,895 --> 01:25:13,412
People!....Ouch!...Matouskova?!?

1094
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:20,350
Quiet, people...it's starting...

1095
01:25:28,341 --> 01:25:30,658
Women!...Open!...Women!

1096
01:25:32,496 --> 01:25:33,832
People!...Let me pass...

1097
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:35,510
This must be a mistake...

1098
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,517
This wasn't a part of the practice!

1099
01:25:37,517 --> 01:25:40,839
This man is fighting for his life!

1100
01:25:41,991 --> 01:25:43,380
Open!

1101
01:25:55,578 --> 01:25:57,944
- Jesus!
- Help!

1102
01:25:58,547 --> 01:26:00,704
What are you doing, man!

1103
01:26:04,671 --> 01:26:08,433
The Italians are gonna like this, eh?

1104
01:27:14,535 --> 01:27:16,575
Oh my God!

1105
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:25,887
Please be patient.

1106
01:27:25,887 --> 01:27:27,180
Dear friends,

1107
01:27:27,397 --> 01:27:28,989
Due to technical difficulties...

1108
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:33,410
We are going to start the program
with a show of the beach hostesses.

1109
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,799
So, let's start, please...Girls!

1110
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,504
C'mon...don't be shy...Come

1111
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:38,404
Chief!

1112
01:28:38,716 --> 01:28:41,561
- Chief!
- What?

1113
01:28:41,923 --> 01:28:43,966
- A screwup!
- What are you talking about?

1114
01:28:44,186 --> 01:28:46,328
The Italians! At the village!

1115
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,054
Wait...How come?

1116
01:28:49,054 --> 01:28:53,832
Take these! It's the mayor's order,
and I don't want to have problems!

1117
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:59,144
Thank you...Thank you very much, madam!

1118
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:03,455
However, if you could offer something to drink instead?

1119
01:29:03,665 --> 01:29:06,886
They didn't tell me anything about any drinks!
If you are thirsty, the well is over there!

1120
01:29:33,628 --> 01:29:36,041
Segnora Maria!

1121
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:38,324
- Father!
- Segnora!

1122
01:29:40,325 --> 01:29:44,773
Father, I'm so happy to see you again!
Maria!

1123
01:29:48,865 --> 01:29:51,643
This is my Cecilia...

1124
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,722
My dear...

1125
01:29:58,969 --> 01:30:03,051
The father...he's been telling me
so much about you...

1126
01:30:12,183 --> 01:30:14,625
What a surprise, eh?

1127
01:30:15,384 --> 01:30:17,167
Oh yeah!

1128
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:22,066
So girls...let's go...

1129
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,594
...with a beautiful smile...the way we practised...

1130
01:30:26,241 --> 01:30:27,969
...don't be shy...

1131
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:31,171
Sodom and Gomorrah!

1132
01:30:32,951 --> 01:30:34,652
I've already seen this...

1133
01:30:34,652 --> 01:30:36,747
- Who are these?
- These are girls working on the farm...

1134
01:30:36,747 --> 01:30:41,183
- They are interested in art...
- This is a new tradition here...

1135
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,338
Well, first you said we have to be
world-class, now you say not...

1136
01:30:44,588 --> 01:30:46,698
C'mon, girls, let's go have a drink...

1137
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,225
I'm OK!

1138
01:31:53,444 --> 01:31:56,149
If you agree, we can sign the agreement right away!

1139
01:31:56,848 --> 01:32:00,961
Well...but...we haven't been able to
fix everything yet.

1140
01:32:03,405 --> 01:32:05,684
You don't need to fix anything! Anything!

1141
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:09,342
How come? How come?

1142
01:32:10,144 --> 01:32:14,399
You haven't seen anything here yet...right?

1143
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:19,545
We know everything! We hired a company to
do a research about you

1144
01:32:19,899 --> 01:32:22,115
And we even know the things which aren't true!

1145
01:32:22,671 --> 01:32:25,066
We plan to make a museum out of your village!

1146
01:32:29,574 --> 01:32:31,205
A museum in the middle of nature!

1147
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,102
The whole world will be coming over

1148
01:32:33,363 --> 01:32:35,769
To see the birthplace of the Planicek method.

1149
01:32:36,663 --> 01:32:40,649
And tourists...this means money!

1150
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:47,108
And from your toxic milk we'll be making
amazing buttons!

1151
01:32:47,465 --> 01:32:49,714
Super business!

1152
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:55,633
- But, what's going to happen with us?
- What do I know?

1153
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:59,180
Nothing...just like before. Everything
must remain the way it has been.

1154
01:32:59,432 --> 01:33:00,944
Together with the personnel!

1155
01:33:01,146 --> 01:33:03,258
Do you agree?

1156
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:07,955
Wait! Do you know what this means?

1157
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,993
After all, we don't want to be the clowns for
the rest of Europe!

1158
01:33:11,472 --> 01:33:13,876
So what? We've been doing this for 40 years for free.

1159
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:17,048
Why shouldn't we do it now for money? Right?

1160
01:33:21,009 --> 01:33:25,227
- What are you waiting for?!?
- Don't blabber, and write!

1161
01:33:25,227 --> 01:33:28,323
Pepa...my glasses...

1162
01:33:29,789 --> 01:33:31,601
With your right hand!

1163
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:50,516
God...
It's already here!

1164
01:33:50,903 --> 01:33:53,856
It's already here!
It's already here!

1165
01:33:54,074 --> 01:34:01,687
/It's already here!
This was the slogan of the first democratic
demonstration in Prague on Nov. 17, 1989 when
the government of Husak was removed from power./

1166
01:34:02,465 --> 01:34:04,633
...Now I'm going to prepare
your pillow...

1167
01:34:04,967 --> 01:34:07,300
...you'll sleep like in Heaven.

1168
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:11,926
...now we'll fix the hair...

1169
01:34:16,386 --> 01:34:18,262
Venco! Did you cut the grass?

1170
01:34:18,678 --> 01:34:20,137
Just stop bugging me about the grass!

1171
01:34:20,387 --> 01:34:21,595
Yeah...just stop...

1172
01:34:21,846 --> 01:34:24,304
I won't anything to do tonight...

1173
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,765
- The lady...
- I can see!

1174
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:53,812
Hi. May I?

1175
01:34:58,896 --> 01:35:00,647
Hmm... Thanks...

1176
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:04,732
It's nice...

1177
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:07,065
May you be happy...

1178
01:35:07,774 --> 01:35:09,941
Hmm... Thanks...

1179
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:45,367
C'mon, don't cry...

1180
01:35:45,367 --> 01:35:47,451
Here you have a child...and Venca...

1181
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:50,909
What a car!
If one could only have one...

1182
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:54,161
You'll have a better one!
We all will have...

1183
01:35:54,619 --> 01:35:57,454
We'll have a future that we've never
even dreamed about!

1184
01:35:58,078 --> 01:35:59,370
I already see it...

1185
01:36:01,371 --> 01:36:04,205
It will be Heaven on Earth when you look around!

1186
01:36:04,663 --> 01:36:06,331
A happy future!

1187
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:08,248
There will be three cars here...

1188
01:36:09,123 --> 01:36:10,790
...a pool...with air conditioning...

1189
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:14,166
...and we'll get a telephone even in the barn!

1190
01:36:16,292 --> 01:36:20,709
The whole world will admire us!!!

1191
01:36:21,376 --> 01:36:23,084
We won't get lost again!

1192
01:36:23,793 --> 01:36:27,252
Even more so - now that we stand with one foot...

1193
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:35,880
...in Europe!!!
