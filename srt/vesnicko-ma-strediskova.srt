5
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:28,933
You're trotting about like goat.

6
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,415
Missed it up again, doctor?

7
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,216
- Like hell I have.

8
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:05,739
- Finished - start her up.

9
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:06,859
- Thanks.

10
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:39,383
Good morning.

11
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,185
Let's start feet together,
arms extended,

12
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,065
palms up.

13
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:49,024
Raise you arms...
- Washed your feet?

14
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,906
I can tell.
Makes a difference for the driver.

15
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,227
What about the ears?

16
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:03,587
You always forget something.

17
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:08,628
Those sails must not be neglected.

18
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:11,029
Yesterday's load was cement.

19
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,909
If it rains,
concrete'll set behind you ears.

20
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:17,469
They'll have to chisel it off.

21
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,990
You should've been born a horse.

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,910
But the Lord changed his mind.

23
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:37,433
Beneath him the beautiful distant places
lie,

24
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:42,473
round which the mountains darkly rise.

25
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:45,794
By woods encircled all around.

26
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:52,634
Amidst the flower-spattered ground.
The bright lake sleeps in slumber sound.

27
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:56,516
The waters rippling
to its shores're striving to meet.

28
00:03:57,236 --> 00:04:00,876
Until at last
they marge in one luminous sheet.

29
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:05,917
Only the turtle-dove does not coo forth
its call to love anymore.

30
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:13,999
Don't shit yourself, cardboard dude!

31
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,518
Take these for your ears.

32
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:22,519
If you wear them, the ears'll stick
to your head beautifully.

33
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:55,724
A pine grove rustles on the lake's
still shore,

34
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,966
Whence glorious psalm of speckled thrush
ascends.

35
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:05,966
A portly tree stands on the rock -
an old eak.

36
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:10,848
Through the green vale scattering
the blossoms white,

37
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:14,408
Guding the wild geese over the woods
in flight.

38
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:21,128
Aren't you cold?

39
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:23,929
- I am, but nobody wants to warm me up.

40
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,169
- Why dodn't you say something?
- You're a right one, eh?

41
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,410
You're all smoke and no fire.
See you.

42
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,176
Living it up, eh?

43
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:09,056
- I wish!
My wife had a boy yesterday.

44
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,336
We celebrated a little.

45
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,217
- Are redheads celebrated too?
I'm surprised.

46
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,457
- What's up?
- A little celebration.

47
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,137
Celebrate, with your work!

48
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,223
- Your mate!

49
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:05,105
- I didn't see him over there.

50
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,985
- Look at him!
Look at the nitwit!

51
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:24,947
That... that...
If it was stone, you'd've been dead!

52
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,707
You...
An animal has more brains!

53
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,189
You oaf!

54
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:38,429
Gone's the furor of that Age
which Time bore far away.

55
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,870
Far-far off even its dream -
as a shadow did it fade,

56
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,351
As the image of white citiens
in the waters'depths arrayed,

57
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,432
As the last thoughts of the dead,

58
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,232
The names that once they bore,
The roll and roar of battle...

59
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:01,393
That's all I remember.

60
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,039
Feasting on the beauty again, eh?

61
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,119
- I wonder of she has brakes at all?

62
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
- Get the rope.

63
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
The rope!

64
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,564
You'll come to a bad end, doctor.

65
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,645
- We all will.

66
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,053
The gate-post was one week old.

67
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,254
It cost me 500.

68
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:31,096
I'm through with Rakosnik.
Take it from me -

69
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:33,137
let someone else have the pleasure.

70
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,538
- I know it's not easy for you.

71
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,738
But who should I entrust him to?
- I don't care!

72
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,617
I've had this millstone around my neck
for 5 years!

73
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,737
A saint youldn't put up with it!
- I know how you feel.

74
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:45,179
But who should I entrust him to?
Duda's too young.

75
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,259
Duda's too young.
Can I entrust him

76
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,659
to your husband?
- He'd kill him.

77
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,139
He's terribly bad-tempered.

78
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:55,100
- It'd serve him right!
- Have you really

79
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,821
flattened the Prague weekender'fence?

80
00:10:58,101 --> 00:10:59,541
- Come on...

81
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:04,782
You know that...
The boy needs a father's touch.

82
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,462
You've got it.

83
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,302
You can handle him
and he listens to you.

84
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,023
- Nothing doing -
let me have Sestak back.

85
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,463
A moron too, but at least he can sing.

86
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:18,983
Nobody's truck's as clean as yours.

87
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,783
You can't take that away from Otik.

88
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,945
- Till the hervest's over,
not a minute longer.

89
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,745
There you are.

90
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,751
Here I am.
Been waiting long?

91
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,551
They delivered the meat.

92
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,071
- Who gave them to you?
- Mr. Pavek.

93
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,151
They say he was mad with rage.

94
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,792
He doesn't want you anymore.

95
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:17,192
The'll hand you over to someone else.

96
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:20,033
He was fuming.

97
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:25,274
You'll be Turek's mate - I guess.

98
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:30,435
You' II have a hard time!
I've brought you some shirts and socks.

99
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,475
You've nothing to wear.

100
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:37,876
And don't think,
Turek's not going to baby you.

101
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:39,796
You know.

102
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,556
I'll bring the rest tomorrow -
was too busy to wash them.

103
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,717
Turek's been known to hit his mates.

104
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,798
What's this?
Where's it from?

105
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:52,598
Come here, Otik!

106
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,199
Did you have woman here?

107
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,440
Come on.

108
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,161
Come.
Swear -

109
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,840
by the picture of your poor late
parents: Did you have woman here?

110
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,642
Look into my eyes:
Yes or no?

111
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,802
O.K., let's go and wash up.

112
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:30,684
Don't go into the front parlour
too often - it gets untidy easily.

113
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:36,604
Clear the mess of the table yourself,
after we've washed up.

114
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,325
Why don't you take off this finery?

115
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,086
Let me do it for you.

116
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,888
That's better.

117
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:57,408
C'mon -

118
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,288
I haven't got much time.

119
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:03,530
Come on.

120
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:19,052
A man, and he can't break
a pigeon's neck.

121
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:20,652
And a pigeon breeder to boot!

122
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:26,972
Dash it, I forgot
what I wanted to tell you!

123
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,374
It can wait though, I'll tel you later.

124
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:34,414
The laundry's done.
I'll bring the bedclothes afterwards.

125
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:37,293
The rabbit and dumplings're in the oven.

126
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,055
Warm them up properly.

127
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:49,376
Otik!
A superb film - Rumanian.

128
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,016
Have you got a ticket?
No.

129
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,376
You must see it.

130
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,337
Where have I...?
Here.

131
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:57,338
Good thing I've bought it for you.
Don't miss the newsreel.

132
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,378
Put you suit on, quick.
Let's go.

133
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:03,738
It's partly travel,
partly erotic.

134
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,779
I'd like to see it once more,

135
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:09,659
but I must go to a lecture on livestock
instead.

136
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,419
My old box's out of order.

137
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:19,981
A bad tube, I guess.

138
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,182
Otas!
In no case leave before the film's over!

139
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,102
The end's the best.

140
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,223
Enjoy yourself.

141
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:46,905
Mrs. Hruskova!
Mrs. Hruskova!

142
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,745
What's it like?

143
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:54,186
- They nearly cancelled it.

144
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,827
All told, I sold six tickets.

145
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:59,307
- Jo?
Aha.

146
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:03,267
Bye then.

147
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:35,592
What am I picking?
- Nettles, for the Easter stuffing.

148
00:16:35,752 --> 00:16:37,432
- But I don't use that much.

149
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,633
- Is the film showing?

150
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:42,593
- Yes, but it was nearly cancelled.
- How come?

151
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:45,194
I myself sent six people.
- They all came.

152
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:51,315
Vasku.

153
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,957
This'll give me herpes again.
- You beast!

154
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,001
- I couldn't wait to be with you...

155
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,685
Don't be scared, Sonia.
Don't worry.

156
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:59,726
Just have a bang, Eugene!

157
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:08,526
- Mind you graves, raven.

158
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:13,288
Driving forward's easy,
but you got to have a knack for backing.

159
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,208
- Dinner's ready, Dad.

160
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,330
Dad, they say
you bumped into Mr. Rumlena's gate-post.

161
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,291
It isn's true, is it?
- Just eat and mind your own business.

162
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,454
Can't eat with all this singing.

163
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,054
Isn't it enough
to live next to the cemetery?

164
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:57,214
Of you can't sing anything else,
at least cut it out while we eat.

165
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:05,095
It's like chewing wreaths.

166
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,578
- Actually,
it's quite a wreck.

167
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,458
We went to look.

168
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,258
- So what?

169
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:26,660
So what?

170
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,299
- Good evening -

171
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,019
night, rather.

172
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,899
- Goodbye.
Well, see you.

173
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,460
Tuesday at nine then.
- Yes.

174
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,060
Let's go!
- Good night.

175
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,381
- Bring the rum.
- Sure.

176
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,062
- Why the rush?

177
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,942
- It's a PTA meeting tonight.

178
00:19:50,543 --> 00:19:52,343
You must go, I can't.

179
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,104
Didn't get my hair done.
- To school?

180
00:19:57,384 --> 00:19:59,263
- You go...

181
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:01,103
- I don't mind going.

182
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,507
They should all have their own towels.

183
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,067
Keep an eye on their homework.

184
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:20,987
That's all for now, thank you.

185
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,628
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

186
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,228
Make sure they dress properly.

187
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,908
Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied.
Good-bye.

188
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:33,109
- Good-bye.

189
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:35,829
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

190
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,749
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

191
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,031
What's the matter?

192
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,791
- What about her writing.
- All right.

193
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,232
It's neat.
- I see.

194
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:53,713
Gotta any problems?
- Got.

195
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:57,992
She has problems with pronouns.
Practise them with her.

196
00:20:58,352 --> 00:20:59,953
Personal pronouns in particular.

197
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:02,433
- Pronouns in particular.
- I see.

198
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:05,634
Thanks then.

199
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,355
How d'you like it here?

200
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:12,315
- Quite, I hope I'll get used...

201
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:16,155
- What's keeping you?
- I'm just going.

202
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,797
- When'll the next PTA meeting be?

203
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:21,917
- In 3 months.

204
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:24,717
- Hm.

205
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,238
Good-bye then.
- Good-bye.

206
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:50,481
They say you ruined
the wekender's gate-post.

207
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,441
Is it true?

208
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:57,562
- Gate-post?
The whole shed, including the roof!

209
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,442
- Good Lord!

210
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,051
I've no mate, man.

211
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:56,971
He's either on strike,
or has hanged himself.

212
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:42,858
Shut up, you beast!

213
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,900
Otik, get up.

214
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,020
You I have lovely ears, but no money.

215
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,181
Get up, we're going for cement.

216
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:08,102
Water levels:
Brandys nad Labem 146/60,

217
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:11,983
Melnik 252/115,

218
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:16,144
Usti nad Labem 180/144,

219
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:20,264
Decin 175/171,

220
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:24,905
Orlice-Tyniste nad Orlici 92/10.

221
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,105
Still waiting for you to warm me up.

222
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:31,585
- It'll happen one day.

223
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,747
Don't eavesdrop - you a spy or what?

224
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:46,949
Don't forget the meeting.

225
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:17,993
- Will you watch my back for me?

226
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,794
- What's your mate good for?
- Nothing.

227
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:34,315
- Put it here.
- No jo.

228
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,356
- You brought fodder?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:42,517
- From Kolin?
- Yeah.

230
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,757
- A mix?
- Yeah.

231
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:48,358
NO SMOKING

232
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:58,639
That's not very clever.
- What?

233
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,080
- Putting used matches
back into the box.

234
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,560
- Why?
- You'll see one day.

235
00:26:16,323 --> 00:26:17,763
Mr. Pavek,

236
00:26:21,962 --> 00:26:26,684
I don't want to work with Turek.

237
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:30,004
- You didn't appreciate me.

238
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:32,404
When the harvest's over,
you'll join Turek.

239
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:37,005
- Me?
When the rake starts flowering.

240
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,526
- Take a look at it at home.
It may be budding.

241
00:26:54,888 --> 00:26:56,408
- When the harvest's over, it's Turek.

242
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,296
What is it, Otik?

243
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:55,497
Look - Otik brought you this.

244
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,978
He likes you, poor thing.

245
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,578
He doesn't know how to tell you.

246
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,820
You should forgive him.

247
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:34,223
When the pressure falls before a storm,
I feel wiped out.

248
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:37,224
- So do I - what's next?

249
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:40,584
- Varicose veins.

250
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:42,985
- Look at mine.

251
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,626
- D'you wear elastic stockings?
- I do.

252
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,105
- D'you take Anavenol?
- I do.

253
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:52,185
- That's it then.
Go on.

254
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,587
- I'm serving beer.

255
00:28:58,307 --> 00:29:00,587
Someone asks for the bill.

256
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,988
I turn my head and it won't go back.

257
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:06,308
- Can you turn the whole body,
like this?

258
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:11,589
- Sure.
- Turn the whole body then.

259
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,229
Go on.

260
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,710
- I can't sleep.

261
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,711
I wake up at four
and I can't go back to sleep.

262
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,231
- Commonplace at this age.
I'm wakeful from half past three.

263
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,752
What's next?

264
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:35,633
- My joints.
Sometimes I can hardly get up.

265
00:29:35,713 --> 00:29:38,673
- But you do?
- In the end, because, I have to.

266
00:29:38,873 --> 00:29:41,434
- Why complain then?
There're people who can't at all.

267
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,995
- Doctor, you make light of everything.

268
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:50,235
I know best how I feel.
I'm not going to be here much longer.

269
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:54,875
- D'you want spa treatment?

270
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:57,396
- No, it didn't do me any good.

271
00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:59,677
- Close down the pub
and go to the sea then.

272
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:02,597
- I went the year before last.
It gives me the runs.

273
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,557
- Go to the High Tatra then.
- I can't stand heights.

274
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:08,718
- You know where to go then?

275
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:15,559
Go to Pelhrimov
and have a look at the cramtorium -

276
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,639
so you know what it's like there.

277
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,999
Yeah?
Next!

278
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,281
Dear comrade, with reference
to the demanding plan targets...

279
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:31,881
- A lovely ship!

280
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:35,002
Where did you get if from?
- The boy made it.

281
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:39,603
...in the interest
of producer-end-user relations,

282
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:41,803
our organization needs a driver's mate.

283
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:45,163
- Your Honza?
- Ships're his hobby.

284
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,764
We'd like to make use of the extensive
experience of your employee,

285
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:50,604
comrade Rakosnik.

286
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:54,525
We have offered him a company flat
on a housing estate in Prague

287
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,485
and he has accepted.

288
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:01,166
METALWOOD, perschnel dept., Koutna.

289
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:04,167
- Expect Otik going to Prague

290
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:07,367
to save the producer-end-user-relations?

291
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,368
- Something like it.
What have you to say?

292
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,369
- Me - I'm through with him.

293
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,928
What is there for me to say?

294
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:18,448
- That's just it.
- What's just it?

295
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:24,170
- Can you imagine the boy
going to Prague?

296
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,290
Can you just imagine it?

297
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,530
He gets lost in the streets.

298
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,451
All the houses're the same
on the housing estate.

299
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,611
No one to turn to.

300
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:37,492
That match's not a good idea, Jaromir!

301
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:41,253
Terrible to think of our Otik stopping
Prague traffic.

302
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:46,132
To let a truck back in somewhere.

303
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:48,133
- I prefer not to.

304
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,734
- This letter...

305
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,694
This is the last time you to this!

306
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:00,256
Tohle bylo naposledy.
What's the big idea?

307
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:04,016
That I'd be carrying on with her,
at my age?

308
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:06,256
Another raid like this and you're fired!

309
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:08,496
This'll give me a stroke!
Co je?

310
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:12,217
- Just came in to ask who'll pick
the kid up from kindergarten.

311
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,177
- Granny, as always.

312
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,817
- That's what I wanted to know.

313
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:19,178
- He needs treatment.

314
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:21,538
That's not normal.

315
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:23,538
- Sorry.

316
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:28,340
- This letter did not write itself.

317
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,780
Sure - someone must've written it.
- That's just it.

318
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,620
- You look as if I'd written it myself.

319
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,582
- You didn't - some Koutna woman
wrote it, personnel dept.

320
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:44,621
But someone must've told them
about Otik, eh?

321
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:47,462
With my common sense,
it's easy to work out

322
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:49,823
- Now I see,
- who in this village'd benefit...

323
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:53,703
- I see.
You think then I fixed it up in Prague...

324
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:56,024
- I didn't say that.
I'm just asking.

325
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:59,824
- For 5 years, I've been chained to him.

326
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:03,145
Taught him to use knife and fork,

327
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:07,066
to wash, so that he wouldn't fall
under my wheels.

328
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:09,426
...like he was my own son...

329
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,826
...now they'll suspect me!

330
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,945
Don't take it too seriously, dad.
- Cut it out!

331
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,067
Dancing - when a funeral's on!
Get down!

332
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:21,827
- Silence please - a funeral's on!

333
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:24,348
- Mind your business - graveyrad bully!

334
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,748
You're behaving like a ruffion.

335
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:29,229
Good morning, doctor.

336
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:33,230
How convenient
to live by the burial pit, eh?

337
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,630
- 'Morning.

338
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:57,873
- Shine on me the sun...

339
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,760
- And music as well!

340
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,606
The boy'll perish in Prague
within a week.

341
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,887
It's either a crazy idea, or a set-up.

342
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:29,327
What's it look like on the 7th step?

343
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:36,369
- They're there.
- How are you?

344
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:40,528
- Fine, but from the dizziness.

345
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,048
- As you get up?
- Yes.

346
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:46,850
In the morning, sit up in bed first,
stay like that for some time,

347
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,090
get up carefully.
- Ano.

348
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,291
- Have you still fot the pills?
- Yes.

349
00:35:53,411 --> 00:35:54,371
- Fajn.

350
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:03,413
What gave you the idea that

351
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:06,373
the 7th step'd give it
the right temperature?

352
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:09,053
- Long-term trials.
It's warm on the 6th,

353
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,014
too cold on the 8th.
- I see.

354
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,254
- Karel likes experimenting, eh?

355
00:36:13,574 --> 00:36:15,054
He's fond of trials.

356
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:17,974
- Good morning, doctor.
- 'Morning.

357
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:21,176
- How did it go for him?
- He had a beautiful funeral.

358
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:22,736
Give me a drink, just a drop.

359
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,496
What a lovely day!
- It's so fresh!

360
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:34,978
Such moments should be remembered,

361
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,018
to fall back on.

362
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:42,738
To warm you up in winter.
- Look!

363
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:50,220
Such beauties're becoming rarer,
but there's still something left.

364
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,460
Some woodland, beer's good...
...sometimes...

365
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,822
- I'll fetch the plates.

366
00:36:59,262 --> 00:37:00,742
- And the girls, Karel,

367
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:05,302
our girls're the most beautiful
in the world.

368
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:09,983
The Spanish or Italian women can't match
up - they mostly have goat-like legs.

369
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:14,463
Did you notice how many girls
walk about braless?

370
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:20,064
- I did.
- Nice fashion, eh?

371
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:22,104
- Yeah.

372
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:26,986
- I'm glad it's spread
as far as our village.

373
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:35,148
- This gravestone artist's a pain.
Fanda -

374
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:39,707
your diligence's getting on my nerves.

375
00:37:40,347 --> 00:37:42,307
- Tool busy, doctor.

376
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:48,269
Many cadavers, few engravers.

377
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:50,869
- Come and wash away the dust.

378
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:03,792
Where did we leave off?
- That they walk about braless.

379
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:07,151
- Yeah, looks like
we're not going to conclude it.

380
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:13,433
- Anything special you're busy with?
- An interesting gravestone -

381
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:17,073
with no inscription.

382
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:20,633
It'll be added on when the person dies.

383
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:23,634
- Did he place an advance order
for a tomb?

384
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:25,915
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

385
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,115
- I mustn't tell.

386
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,435
- People don't know what to do
with money.

387
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:36,796
He's got a house, TV, car.
What is there I haven't got, he asks?

388
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,396
A tomb.

389
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,480
Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,600
- Hi.

391
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,449
Your guardian angel's having

392
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,369
a hell of a job.

393
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,410
- The madguard needs replacing, I guess?

394
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,890
- No use, unless you got a rubber one.

395
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:43,096
Jesus!

396
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:37,264
In days past,

397
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:41,424
Czechs were strong and steadfast,

398
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:46,026
In days past,

399
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:48,786
"they were, for the eyes, a repast."

400
00:42:26,072 --> 00:42:28,832
Missing your old school?

401
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:31,031
- I've come to ask
how my sister's doing.

402
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,433
- I see. Going to sit
for your finals, aren't you?

403
00:42:33,513 --> 00:42:35,633
- Yes.
- What'll you do afterwards?

404
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,633
- Go to a dung college, er -
School of Agriculture.

405
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,874
- I'll keep my fingers crossed for you -
don't let the side down!

406
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:45,275
- I drilled the pronouns with her -

407
00:42:45,635 --> 00:42:47,715
was it any good, I wonder?

408
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,195
Like she din't botch up her dictation
again?

409
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:52,396
Shal I carry your bag?
- Yes.

410
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:54,876
Unusual - a brother so interested

411
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:56,477
in his sister's progress.

412
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,837
- Our parents're too busy.
It's up to me then.

413
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:01,157
- Hm.

414
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,397
- It's excercise-books, eh?

415
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:07,437
- Yes, exercise-books.

416
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:11,639
- What're you laughing at?
- Nothing.

417
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,519
How you're chatting me up through
your sister.

418
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:18,359
- I'm a nuisance, eh?
- Why?

419
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,560
You should concentrate on your studies
now -

420
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,601
and don't try to sweep older girls
off their feet.

421
00:43:41,043 --> 00:43:43,923
Aunt, are there rooms to let?

422
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:49,525
- Are you my nephew?

423
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:51,765
Funny thing, I don't know you!
- Okay,

424
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:53,805
so how about some accommodation?

425
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:56,526
- The village's changed, young man.

426
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,127
We don't address each other
as Aunt and Uncle.

427
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:01,646
We use our first names
and 'comrade'instead.

428
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:03,806
I wouldn't insist on that.

429
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,927
The customs have changed, though.

430
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:09,567
Like when a man addresses a lady:

431
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:12,128
He stands up first and greets her.

432
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:14,328
- Okay then.

433
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,969
I wish you good morning.
Permit me to ask you:

434
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:22,449
What about some abode, ma'am?

435
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,171
- C'mon then.

436
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:33,711
- Do your customs allow a man to walk
behind a lady, or next to her?

437
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:36,512
- He may walk next to her,
of he can keep up.

438
00:44:51,214 --> 00:44:53,615
Hi.
- Ahoj.

439
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,615
- How's life?

440
00:44:58,014 --> 00:44:59,514
- Not bad.

441
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:06,416
- Yeah.
Oh, well.

442
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,218
Look where you're going,
or you'll trip up.

443
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,919
- Take it easy.
- Shut up and clear off!

444
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,420
Why're you out here with next
to nothing on?

445
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:30,320
- It's warm, isn't it?

446
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,820
- How come that milkso's so familiar?

447
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,820
- We've always been on first name terms!

448
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,021
- Interesting!
Where's the kid?

449
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:41,722
- With Granny.
- Interesting!

450
00:45:44,222 --> 00:45:45,922
- You find everything interesting.

451
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:47,522
- I'm not a moron.

452
00:45:51,324 --> 00:45:52,724
- She always goes to Granny
from kindergarten.

453
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:54,624
You never found that interesting before.

454
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,624
If this goes on, I'll do the same.

455
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,424
That'll make it even more interesting.

456
00:46:07,426 --> 00:46:10,326
- Let's go for a swim.
It'll be empty now.

457
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,226
- I can't go into the water today.

458
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:15,727
- You can watch me then.

459
00:46:46,832 --> 00:46:48,432
You time me.

460
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:01,733
Now!

461
00:47:10,835 --> 00:47:13,436
- Jesus Vasek, don't be a fool!

462
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:17,737
Don't, Pepik's here!

463
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,641
Thirty-three!
- Too bad.

464
00:47:44,641 --> 00:47:46,041
Go on!

465
00:47:52,242 --> 00:47:54,343
- How long?
- About half a minute.

466
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:57,242
Please, go away.
- We've plenty of time.

467
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:02,843
- Just a carp.

468
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:08,145
Thirty-seven!

469
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:16,045
- Not bad, eh?
D'you know how long Sestak can hold out?

470
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:20,247
Twenty-six, a non-smoker!

471
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,446
- I was wrong - thirty-one!

472
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,647
- Impossible!
- Thirty-one!

473
00:48:28,647 --> 00:48:30,147
- Watch it, then!

474
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:36,249
- Otik's place tonight, right?

475
00:48:42,649 --> 00:48:44,550
- Forty-two!
- No!

476
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:46,851
Fine!

477
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:57,052
I've changed the bedclothes for you.

478
00:48:57,352 --> 00:49:01,052
It'll be like in a hotel.
- Thanks, lady.

479
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:03,853
- He'll stay with Otik.

480
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:06,053
At least Otik'll not be so lonely.

481
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,854
It'll be for the better.

482
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:16,355
D'you have to paint the fence so shabby?

483
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:18,655
- You find it shabby?
- I told you

484
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,255
I was going to put in new planks.

485
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:22,257
This way, they look as if they were
in pieces.

486
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,256
- I paint them the way the are.

487
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:27,256
- Can't you imagine a repired fence?

488
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:30,956
- It looks better this way, doesn't it?
- What about the pealing plaster?

489
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:35,758
Is that supposed to look better?
- Don't meddle with it, Hrabetova!

490
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,058
What d'you charge for such a painting?

491
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,359
- Want to buy it?
- No,

492
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,759
I want you to paint my house.

493
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:47,360
- Which one is it?
- Over there.

494
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:53,460
- I couldn't cope with that one.

495
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,560
- If you can cope with an old ruin.

496
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,360
Why not with a decent house?

497
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,262
If you want to paint the eaves true to
life,

498
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:03,262
I've got some green paint left over.

499
00:50:05,662 --> 00:50:07,862
- I simply couldn't.
If I don't like something,

500
00:50:07,862 --> 00:50:10,264
there's no way I can paint it.

501
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:13,264
- He likes our old ruins, doesn't he?

502
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:16,064
- There're many things to my liking.

503
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,471
I'm not in charge of animals,
but paperwork.

504
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:02,371
I'm a personnel manager for livestock.

505
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,672
I've a file on each calf:
Its family background,

506
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:07,572
what sort of stud its father was,

507
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:09,472
what sort of cow its mother was.

508
00:51:09,672 --> 00:51:11,973
- It was not our idea.

509
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:15,774
If they want it, just fill it in.

510
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:21,273
- I've been wandering about it -
I see it's yours.

511
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:25,075
- Thanks, where did you find it?
- You'd better not ask.

512
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,975
- Let's see about the letter
and go home.

513
00:51:30,275 --> 00:51:32,376
- Tell them to get stuffed -
it's nonsense.

514
00:51:32,576 --> 00:51:34,576
- Let's hear from Rakosnik.

515
00:51:34,876 --> 00:51:36,376
- That means staying here till midnight.

516
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,077
- Fetch him, please.

517
00:51:40,877 --> 00:51:42,978
- Before she drags him
out of the cinema...

518
00:51:43,378 --> 00:51:45,178
- How d'you know he's there?

519
00:51:49,878 --> 00:51:53,879
This game is more cheaty

520
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,379
than the others.

521
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,579
- But, Mister, it was just fun,

522
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,281
I've found more clever game.

523
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:06,181
Wanna know which one?
How about playing humans

524
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,381
going for a sunday swim?

525
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:10,882
- But how they'll get to the riverside?

526
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,783
You won't tell us who it was?

527
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,884
- He knows nothing.
He was from Prague, wasn't he?

528
00:52:20,783 --> 00:52:24,683
What did he tell you?
To go to work in Prague?

529
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:29,385
What else did he tell you?

530
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:32,985
- Fifty-seven.

531
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,385
- What d'you mean?

532
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:40,387
- Cinemas - they have.

533
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:45,687
- Listen, Otik -

534
00:52:49,987 --> 00:52:53,488
would you like to go to Prague?

535
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:02,989
You don't like your village -

536
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,891
so small, so beautiful?

537
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:09,991
And the little house you were born in?

538
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,292
The won't let you keep you pigeons -

539
00:53:19,692 --> 00:53:22,392
they shit on their statues.
You don't mind that?

540
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:27,893
Go now.

541
00:53:29,594 --> 00:53:31,094
- Bye.

542
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:39,195
- You're making a big mistake -
you'll pay for it.

543
00:53:39,895 --> 00:53:40,796
- What's that again?

544
00:53:40,896 --> 00:53:42,697
- Putting used matches back
into the box.

545
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:45,597
- There's no doubt -

546
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:49,196
someone from Prague
wants Rakosnik's house.

547
00:53:49,596 --> 00:53:51,096
I can tell you who -

548
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:54,298
this dauber sho's moved in there.

549
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,898
- D'you ever watch detective films
on TV?

550
00:53:58,998 --> 00:54:00,498
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

551
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,799
Otherwise you couldn't say such a thing.

552
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,800
This noted painter got here
after the letter.

553
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,301
I fixed him up at Otik's place.

554
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,001
It was completely my doing.

555
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:17,400
Why I did this is another story.

556
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:21,102
I think someone else wants the house.

557
00:54:22,002 --> 00:54:24,002
Maybe he's among us here.

558
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:26,502
But you work it out yourselves.

559
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:29,904
- Thank you, Super, for your, analysis.

560
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:33,004
I suggest we reply the following:

561
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:35,204
Comrade Rakosnik is a moron.

562
00:54:35,404 --> 00:54:38,104
He has to be supervised
by an experienced worker.

563
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,605
His mental make-up's not up to living
in town.

564
00:54:40,705 --> 00:54:43,406
Also, he keeps pigeons,
which he couldn't in Prague.

565
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:46,205
Full stop.
- You can't write 'moron'.

566
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:49,106
I'd write 'half-wit'
- The doctor said

567
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:51,206
he was momentally backward.

568
00:54:51,406 --> 00:54:54,506
- Mentally.
- Not bad - write it up.

569
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,608
C'mon, it's starting.

570
00:55:04,908 --> 00:55:07,510
- Have they had the mirror yet?
- Not yet.

571
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,210
- I'll join you when the mirror
comes on.

572
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,110
- The American film Harpoon mirrors
that we offer you,

573
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,610
the bourgeois society

574
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,311
where the dollar's
the alpha and omega of life.

575
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:24,211
It was made

576
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:27,012
by Francis S. Jones in 1962.

577
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:34,314
Manhattan, 27th September.

578
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:39,214
- Watching?
So, I won't bother you.

579
00:55:39,314 --> 00:55:40,814
I'll come later then.

580
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:42,614
- Come on in.

581
00:55:45,515 --> 00:55:48,215
- Where's your sister's body - tell us!

582
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:51,615
- If I don't tell you, I can't sleep.

583
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,416
- Say it and you'll sleep.

584
00:55:56,216 --> 00:56:00,317
- Could he leave, or shall we?

585
00:56:01,517 --> 00:56:04,318
- Go and do some gluing.
He didn't want to watch anyway.

586
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:21,220
- Don't shoot until I tell you.

587
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:24,321
- They're meeting there - I saw them.

588
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:26,521
- Jana Turkovic?
- Yes, Jana Turkova.

589
00:56:27,321 --> 00:56:29,621
- It's all over New York.
Photographs in the newspapers.

590
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,722
- If it gets back to Turek,
he'll kill her.

591
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:41,124
- Don't yell, idiot.

592
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:45,423
- Kaspar's a fool, too.

593
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:47,024
She's the mother of a young child.

594
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:50,325
- Where's Bradley?
Where is he?

595
00:56:51,225 --> 00:56:53,125
He should've been here long ago.

596
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:57,725
- Don't wait for Bradley.
I'll take care of him.

597
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,427
- How long have they been at it?
- God knows.

598
00:57:02,227 --> 00:57:04,027
- What's this got to do with his house?

599
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,328
- Of you no gotta dollars,
man, you're in trouble.

600
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:10,829
- Exactly.
I think

601
00:57:11,029 --> 00:57:14,028
he wants to pack him off to Prague

602
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:16,829
to fornicate in his house.

603
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:19,129
Or -

604
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:22,829
he wants it for a friend from Prague

605
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,330
who's only spend the weekends here

606
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:29,531
and the mice could play during the week.
- This woman's stoned.

607
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:33,131
- I don't think so.
It was his suggestion

608
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:34,631
not to let him go.

609
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:37,933
- It's a cover-up.

610
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:42,932
- I'm sorry for the kid,
if it comes to light.

611
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:44,733
- Don't tell anybody!

612
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:52,234
- Like the tomb!

613
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,235
- They killed Bradley!

614
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,150
Hey, wait, Charlie!

615
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,151
He's been invited
by our comrade director.

616
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,151
Follow me, please.
Thanks, Karel, you're very kind.

617
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:41,751
You'll like it here.
Nothing to be afraid of.

618
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,951
All is managed.
Here's the personnel department.

619
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:47,552
But we'll go there later.
Let'go, there...

620
00:59:47,652 --> 00:59:50,252
Good morning.
We'll go there afterwards.

621
00:59:53,053 --> 00:59:54,553
Wait.
Well, go on.

622
01:00:11,155 --> 01:00:13,956
Comrade director,
it's comrade Rakosnik -

623
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:16,757
the one with the house.

624
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,758
Will you take coffee or something
stronger?

625
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:29,559
- A vodka?

626
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,660
What?
- A roll.

627
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
- A roll.

628
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,459
- Welcome, comrade Rakosnik.

629
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:42,361
I hope...

630
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:46,061
...you'll like it here.

631
01:00:47,161 --> 01:00:50,662
I'm pressed for time,

632
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:53,062
you'll have to see to it yourself.
- Sure.

633
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:54,763
- Want the car?
- Yes.

634
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,263
- Take the car!
- Yes, thank's.

635
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:57,863
- See you then.

636
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:00,664
- C'mon, Otik.
Good-bye.

637
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:06,465
- Bad habit, hand-shaking.

638
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,565
They've long given it up in the West.

639
01:01:12,065 --> 01:01:14,765
No wonder we have epidemics of flu here.

640
01:01:35,069 --> 01:01:37,570
A shower - that's something, eh?

641
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:40,569
Watch it now...
All right...

642
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:46,471
They haven't turned it on yet...

643
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:50,271
Cold water, hot water.

644
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,471
Now something you haven't seen yet.

645
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:57,373
It's no like in your place.

646
01:01:57,973 --> 01:01:59,973
Wait till you see the kitchen:

647
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:02,773
Hot and cold water, a sink,

648
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:04,373
an elektric or gas cooker...

649
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:10,074
C'mon, Otik.

650
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:14,174
A modern kitchen, what a marvel!

651
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:20,075
Otiku, Otiku,
C'mon then.

652
01:02:20,976 --> 01:02:22,376
Come on.

653
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:25,177
This is...
Come here.

654
01:02:25,577 --> 01:02:28,677
The latest fittings...
hot and cold water,

655
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:31,177
extractor fan...

656
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:34,379
electric cooker...

657
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:38,378
oven with grill!

658
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:42,579
What a height, eh?

659
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:48,180
What's the matter?
What?

660
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,981
Pigeons?

661
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:56,781
Plenty of them - in the Old Town Square.

662
01:02:57,682 --> 01:03:00,282
It's not so bad, Frantisek.

663
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:06,282
- The moment he's better,
he'll smoke and drink again.

664
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:11,584
You should tell him not to.
He's more likely to listen to you.

665
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:15,384
- If he gave it up all at once,
it'd do no good.

666
01:03:16,184 --> 01:03:19,184
The grave should receive
a decrepit body.

667
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:23,686
You'll cut down, eh?

668
01:03:25,286 --> 01:03:27,186
A cuddly little thing, eh?

669
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:30,487
Very.

670
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:33,587
What's his name?
- He doesn't even have a name.

671
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,987
Dad found him at the railway station.

672
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:39,988
He adopted him and followed him
all the way home.

673
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:42,488
- That's a good doggy.

674
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:45,388
- If you like him, take him.

675
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:46,988
- I would't mind.

676
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,690
- Such a mongral?

677
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:53,390
- They're the best.
Come here.

678
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,492
An accident with the combine harvester -
they've run over Drapalik.

679
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,794
Have a look, doctor, what a sight!

680
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:26,396
He went uder the harvester -
- Yeah.

681
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:28,696
To have a look at the transmission box.

682
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:30,896
Turek backed into him...

683
01:04:30,896 --> 01:04:33,196
We shouted:
"There's a man there, you oaf!","

684
01:04:33,997 --> 01:04:35,896
but he rolled him over once more.

685
01:04:35,896 --> 01:04:37,397
You must see it, doctor...

686
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:39,197
You will see something, let's go.

687
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,899
- Where's he?
- Here.

688
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,500
- What's your opinion, doctor?
- Stand up.

689
01:05:03,102 --> 01:05:04,701
Walk about a bit.

690
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:10,301
- Surprised, eh?
- How steely our people are, eh?

691
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:15,703
- Impossible.

692
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:21,404
If you poured plaster into those,
he'd have a statue.

693
01:05:26,004 --> 01:05:27,505
That'il do.

694
01:05:37,005 --> 01:05:38,405
Bend over.

695
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:44,807
Does it hurt?
- No.

696
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:48,107
- And this?

697
01:05:49,608 --> 01:05:52,009
What's so funny?
- It tickles.

698
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:54,209
- Look, go home and come back tomorrow.
Come.

699
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,510
Turn up the sleeve.
Hold this.

700
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:11,111
- Is it necessary?
- If it weren't,

701
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,511
I wouldn't be doing it.
You think I enjoy it?

702
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:16,112
You had a few, eh?

703
01:06:18,913 --> 01:06:20,313
Keep still then.

704
01:06:22,213 --> 01:06:23,813
All right, that's it.

705
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:47,117
What the hell's all this?

706
01:06:53,118 --> 01:06:54,519
IMMORTAL DRAPALIK /PLASTER/

707
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:58,019
Keep shooting your mouths off

708
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,019
and we'll have the safety officer
breathing down our necks!

709
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,219
No beer out in the fields anymore!

710
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:06,820
Turek, is that clear?

711
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,120
- Sure.
- How come I was not called

712
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,620
in on the accident?

713
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,221
- I guess they didn't want
to wake you up -

714
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,921
if nothing actually happened.

715
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:18,522
- They say Turek was under
the influence.

716
01:07:19,522 --> 01:07:22,823
You were suppposed to take a blood test.
- I did.

717
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:26,923
He was not under the influence.

718
01:07:28,523 --> 01:07:30,324
He was lucky,

719
01:07:31,724 --> 01:07:34,724
for I expect he'll lose his wife soon.

720
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:38,024
If he lost his licence -
that's be

721
01:07:38,124 --> 01:07:39,524
too many blows at once.

722
01:07:46,826 --> 01:07:49,126
- I've got my opinion of the matter.

723
01:07:50,727 --> 01:07:52,127
- Suit yourself.

724
01:07:57,528 --> 01:08:00,928
This is the surest sign of progress.

725
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:03,628
- What is?
- The tinker always came

726
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:08,930
this time of year -
from Slovakia.

727
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:12,530
Today - we have Stefan!

728
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,730
- Perhaps it will not be Stefan.

729
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,030
Maybe they'll send someone else.
- Hardly - but even if:

730
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,532
But even if:
It's a sure sign of progress.

731
01:08:21,032 --> 01:08:23,432
- Can Stefan drink?
We've a bottle for him.

732
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,332
- You're crazy!

733
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:28,133
- He'll get plastered and do a spiral.

734
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:30,232
- Who did this?

735
01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:37,734
You...

736
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:44,034
You lout!

737
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:48,336
- Let him go,
or I'll take you to pieces!

738
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:51,336
Let him be!

739
01:08:52,136 --> 01:08:53,636
- Come off it!
- You me?

740
01:09:04,638 --> 01:09:06,138
- Ouch, you oaf!

741
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,342
- Come off it, boys!

742
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,842
There's no point in it!

743
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:28,641
Calling yourselves cooperative farmers?

744
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,642
What is it?
- Stefan.

745
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,346
- Beat it, boys!

746
01:09:55,046 --> 01:09:56,546
Stefan!

747
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:31,051
Hi, boys, how's life?

748
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:35,251
- Fine.

749
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:08,357
Reserved for redheands!

750
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:41,162
You can cover up adultery in town.

751
01:11:41,862 --> 01:11:43,263
Not here.

752
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:45,763
Unfortunately.

753
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:48,163
- Does it affect the milk yield?

754
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:50,464
- What d'you mean?
- If not,

755
01:11:50,564 --> 01:11:52,165
then it's my private business.

756
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:54,265
- It is and it isn't.

757
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:57,964
The morals of the village're
totally different.

758
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,464
- And what are they?

759
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:02,566
- Unspoilt.
- Aha.

760
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,569
Whose dog is it, doctor?

761
01:12:22,469 --> 01:12:24,169
- Mine -
it was strandel at the railway station.

762
01:12:24,868 --> 01:12:26,568
- A mixed bread, eh?

763
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:29,470
- What's its name?

764
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:32,070
- Lord Charles of the Railway Station.

765
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:05,075
You drinking?

766
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:09,276
That's all right then.

767
01:13:10,876 --> 01:13:12,876
Leave it at that, or you'll be sick.

768
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,080
Going to live in Prague?

769
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,280
- When the harvest's over.

770
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:44,182
- You're a great guy.

771
01:13:45,482 --> 01:13:47,082
I like you.
No.

772
01:13:54,783 --> 01:13:57,383
Try that again and we'll have it out
in the backyard.

773
01:14:11,786 --> 01:14:13,386
Don't pour the beer out the window!

774
01:14:13,486 --> 01:14:14,886
Look at me now!

775
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:17,886
What fun,

776
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:19,487
pouring beer out the window!

777
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:21,788
Hi, Stefan.

778
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:01,093
You've a lovely face,

779
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:04,393
but I like your -
er, the bottom of your pan the best

780
01:15:05,193 --> 01:15:07,694
- Aren't you a lecher, doctor!

781
01:15:08,195 --> 01:15:10,495
- A pan's a frying utensil.

782
01:15:10,595 --> 01:15:12,195
You should know that.

783
01:15:14,895 --> 01:15:16,796
But the other one's lovely too.

784
01:15:27,797 --> 01:15:29,397
D'you like being taken over by him?

785
01:15:30,897 --> 01:15:33,398
- Your sister wrote the best dictation.

786
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:36,899
What?

787
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,799
- Red cabbage!
- I can't hear you!

788
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:44,100
- A cabbage head...

789
01:15:49,101 --> 01:15:51,100
Thinks if he's an artist
he can mess around.

790
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,601
Tell him your foot hurts.
- What?

791
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:55,301
What?
- To tell him,

792
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,301
your leg aches!
He'll leave you alone, the scum.

793
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:58,902
- Her behaviour's excellent, too.

794
01:15:59,002 --> 01:16:00,502
Much better than her brother's.

795
01:16:00,802 --> 01:16:02,503
She doesn't say 'mess around'or acum'.

796
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:19,005
When he clears off,
you'll come crawling.

797
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:21,104
I may not be interested then.

798
01:16:21,505 --> 01:16:23,506
- And she doesn't use blackmail.

799
01:17:08,813 --> 01:17:11,013
I won it for you.

800
01:17:11,713 --> 01:17:13,914
- How nice!
- Cherish it -

801
01:17:14,914 --> 01:17:16,514
it cost me fifty-two crowns.

802
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:21,914
- Good evening, Mr. Kalina.
- Good evening.

803
01:17:22,414 --> 01:17:27,216
My wife told me your son wants to go
to the naval college.

804
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:30,016
- He's set on it.

805
01:17:30,216 --> 01:17:33,016
- Just say,
if you need a good word put in.

806
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:35,216
Our director could be quite helpful.

807
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:39,318
- That's be fine -
there seems to be a rush of applicants.

808
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:42,218
- Let's have a word with him
when he comes.

809
01:17:42,318 --> 01:17:44,218
I discovered a house for him here, see?

810
01:17:44,418 --> 01:17:47,619
- In our village?
- Rakosnik's place.

811
01:17:48,019 --> 01:17:49,719
- Otik's?
- Otik.

812
01:17:50,519 --> 01:17:52,019
- I see.

813
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,420
Where from?
- From Zvolen.

814
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,521
I got married here and settled down.

815
01:18:02,821 --> 01:18:05,722
- Were Slovak girls no good?

816
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:07,822
- The usual story:
I did my National Service here.

817
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:10,422
No the marrying type, I got involved,

818
01:18:10,422 --> 01:18:12,022
couldn't back put.

819
01:18:12,823 --> 01:18:15,524
- He seems to have problems
with backing, eh?

820
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:18,823
- Not a good idea, that match.

821
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:22,424
It'll backfire one day.
- Take it easy.

822
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:34,126
All right?

823
01:18:35,626 --> 01:18:38,026
Don't go to Prague, it's better here.

824
01:18:38,226 --> 01:18:41,228
- I must, when the harvest's over.
- Why -

825
01:18:41,328 --> 01:18:42,928
what's wrong with this place?

826
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:47,028
- Mr. Pavek said
when the harvest was over.

827
01:19:12,532 --> 01:19:14,032
That's it!

828
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:30,035
Where you been?
- What's that to do with you?

829
01:19:30,235 --> 01:19:31,735
- Shut up and come here!

830
01:19:36,035 --> 01:19:40,136
- Boys - leave me in peace
on Sunday at least.

831
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:44,037
- No decent pub without a decent brawl!

832
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:51,537
No.

833
01:19:53,938 --> 01:19:55,539
Have a drink, Vaclav.

834
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,840
- I'm afraid he'll do something to her.

835
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,341
- Looks like it.

836
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:09,841
You've two options now:
Keep your hands off

837
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:11,341
or marry her.

838
01:20:15,441 --> 01:20:17,942
You don't mind the patients urinating
into it?

839
01:20:29,243 --> 01:20:30,744
- Have you had a divorce here?

840
01:20:30,844 --> 01:20:33,445
- This achievement's got as far
as our village.

841
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:42,347
- How d'you go about it?
- An application is filed,

842
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:43,947
There's an application form.

843
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:48,346
- What about Vasek, er -
the engineer -

844
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:50,246
hope he won't lose his eye?

845
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:52,247
- You wouldn't like him one-eyed?

846
01:20:58,848 --> 01:21:00,449
Take this to the police.
It says

847
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:02,649
how you hubby's knocked you about.

848
01:21:03,449 --> 01:21:04,949
- Do I have to?
- Yeah.

849
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:10,351
Tell him I must speak to him.

850
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:17,350
- Which one?
- Turek.

851
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:33,654
He'll be supervised
by an experienced worker

852
01:21:33,854 --> 01:21:36,354
He'll also be in the care
of the works doctor.

853
01:21:37,054 --> 01:21:40,855
We hereby request you
to release him asap.

854
01:21:41,255 --> 01:21:43,255
Hail Peace! Koutna.

855
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:45,455
- What's your opinion?

856
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:55,856
- I'll tell you something.
I'd let him go.

857
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:03,158
He himself wants to go.

858
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,258
Pavek's through with him.

859
01:22:05,859 --> 01:22:07,659
We actually don't know
what to do with him.

860
01:22:08,559 --> 01:22:11,760
I'd let him go.
- You'd let Otik...

861
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,359
...go to Prague?

862
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:15,960
- Let our Otik...
...go to Prague.

863
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,760
- Fancy them being so set
on this nitwit.

864
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,960
I don't get it.

865
01:22:21,461 --> 01:22:23,261
I bet it's because of the house.

866
01:22:23,461 --> 01:22:25,462
- Let's comme clean, comrades.

867
01:22:27,062 --> 01:22:28,462
It is because of the house.

868
01:22:29,662 --> 01:22:31,862
The director of METALWOOD likes it here.

869
01:22:31,962 --> 01:22:36,164
We'd like to adapt his house
for recreational purposes.

870
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,064
- What did I say?

871
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:41,564
- I wouldn't be against it.

872
01:22:42,064 --> 01:22:44,664
The farm'd benefit as well.

873
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:48,965
The'd help us -
with spare parts, he said.

874
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,565
That's the way I see it.

875
01:22:52,166 --> 01:22:54,566
- You've not come completely clean,
have you?

876
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,166
There is some dirt, eh?

877
01:22:56,366 --> 01:22:58,967
- I've told you what I know.
The house's involved,

878
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:01,167
there's no denying it.

879
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:07,468
- You told me the morality
of the village was different.

880
01:23:08,668 --> 01:23:10,068
Unspoilt, eh?

881
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,269
Now you want to make a scapegoat
of a village simpleton.

882
01:23:16,469 --> 01:23:20,270
Even as a city slicker,
I find it too strong a cuppa.

883
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:23,971
- He's right.
- No moralizing

884
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:25,771
from a destroyer of family life!

885
01:23:26,071 --> 01:23:27,871
- He's right.
- Talk to the point.

886
01:23:27,771 --> 01:23:29,372
It's Rakosnik we're discussing now!

887
01:23:29,872 --> 01:23:31,572
I'm waiting for you to say
what's behind it,

888
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:33,172
so I don't have to stop recpecting you.

889
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:35,973
- Look at her!

890
01:23:36,373 --> 01:23:39,274
You stop recpecting yourself!

891
01:23:43,073 --> 01:23:45,573
- You're a miserable village bumkin!

892
01:23:47,373 --> 01:23:50,375
- What did you say, comrade?
- You shouldn't take liberties

893
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:53,075
with the chairman.
- Vaclav, I ask you...

894
01:23:57,376 --> 01:24:00,677
I told you so, Jaromir.
- I think I've burnt it.

895
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:02,777
- Show me.
Leave the room, women.

896
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:04,977
- Don't, auch!

897
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:11,877
- That's all right.

898
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:15,078
You're lucky - a near miss.

899
01:24:15,178 --> 01:24:16,779
You will continue to function.

900
01:24:18,379 --> 01:24:20,779
- You mean as an agronomist.

901
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:24,679
- That'll not be affected in the least.

902
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:39,083
The Alps overwhelm you, Charles.
But this here moves you.

903
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:44,083
Just look at it - see?

904
01:24:44,883 --> 01:24:48,083
It's not a country, it's a garden.

905
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:53,385
If you have heart, you must feel it.

906
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:56,085
Go to hell with those chemicals.

907
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:10,086
A beautiful day, eh,

908
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:13,487
Charles?

909
01:25:19,788 --> 01:25:23,089
The blue haze ascande
with the morning lark,

910
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:26,889
Till there,
on the breast of the blushing sky,

911
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,791
The carolling and the vapours die...

912
01:25:40,492 --> 01:25:44,192
Over the still lake the mist doth away...

913
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:03,595
Messing about with in again, doctor?

914
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:08,196
- Come here!
My back's in two halves.

915
01:26:11,796 --> 01:26:12,696
Jau.

916
01:26:14,596 --> 01:26:16,196
Tell you something.

917
01:26:17,398 --> 01:26:19,698
If you touch her again,

918
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:21,998
I won't be your friend anymore.

919
01:26:22,598 --> 01:26:25,698
- She's still my wife.
- Sure, but you're not going...

920
01:26:26,299 --> 01:26:27,899
But you're not gonna
knock her about!

921
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:30,700
Plump up the pillow for me.

922
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,700
Jau.

923
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:43,201
When you ran Drapalik over, d'you know
what level you had in your blood?

924
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:49,702
I'll tell them.
I'll be mean - make no mistake.

925
01:26:51,002 --> 01:26:53,202
Hell, it hurts.
Forget driving then.

926
01:26:55,704 --> 01:26:58,004
- She's a bitch.
- A pity there aren't shots

927
01:26:58,104 --> 01:27:00,004
for jealousy.

928
01:27:01,304 --> 01:27:03,305
I'd give you a horse dose.

929
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:08,305
Jau, je, joj.

930
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:53,212
The aftermath of the Brussels match

931
01:27:53,212 --> 01:27:56,013
is clearly reflected
in the governmental crisis.

932
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:03,714
- Good Lord!
Karel! Ruzenka!

933
01:28:13,515 --> 01:28:16,215
Come here!
C'mon, help me.

934
01:28:17,015 --> 01:28:19,116
Ooj, jej.
- We need an ambulance.

935
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:24,417
Brug poisoning.
Pavek.

936
01:28:26,317 --> 01:28:27,818
You're crazy!
- Hush!

937
01:28:28,318 --> 01:28:31,418
The gear... the tube.
I'm a Lazarus.

938
01:28:32,919 --> 01:28:34,819
Don't, you'll break me in two.

939
01:28:38,419 --> 01:28:40,919
Karel, can you carry me?
- Yeah.

940
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:46,421
- Slowly!

941
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,821
Jej, jej.
- Careful.

942
01:28:54,421 --> 01:28:56,022
- My slippers - dash!

943
01:28:58,623 --> 01:28:59,923
- Wait!

944
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:09,223
- Where is he?
Over there.

945
01:29:11,024 --> 01:29:13,224
- Help him.
- Get him here!

946
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:17,125
Jarda, c'mon!
So, what is it?

947
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:19,325
What did you gobble up?
- It's all right.

948
01:29:19,525 --> 01:29:21,125
- What's all right?
- Medrin.

949
01:29:21,225 --> 01:29:23,027
- Medrin? How many?
- Yeah, it has remained not much.

950
01:29:23,027 --> 01:29:26,127
Can you hear me?
Who am I?

951
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,527
Look at me.
Who am I?

952
01:29:29,227 --> 01:29:30,727
Who am I?

953
01:29:31,027 --> 01:29:32,928
Well?
What're you mumbling?

954
01:29:33,128 --> 01:29:35,528
What? Hallo!
- What?

955
01:29:38,028 --> 01:29:39,928
Here they are.
Get up then!

956
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:41,829
- Come on.
- Where's he?

957
01:29:43,729 --> 01:29:45,729
- I'm all right.
- Rot.

958
01:29:46,429 --> 01:29:49,530
He gobbled up a little medrin.
- I'd...

959
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:52,431
- Cut it out, caveman.

960
01:29:56,131 --> 01:29:59,431
Why, it's eased off.

961
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:05,432
You've put me right.
Look!

962
01:30:14,134 --> 01:30:16,134
From the seventh?
- I don't drink from anywhere else.

963
01:30:25,736 --> 01:30:27,936
- You've put up with him for years.

964
01:30:28,137 --> 01:30:29,637
- That's it -

965
01:30:30,637 --> 01:30:33,336
he's a life risk.

966
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:38,438
He'll say 1 word per 100 kilometres.

967
01:30:39,838 --> 01:30:42,538
We're going to fetch cement
from Hradec Kralove.

968
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:46,438
In Beroun, he'll say: Beroun.
That's it -

969
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:48,939
he's done his bit.

970
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,740
I'll fall asleep at the wheel one day.

971
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,640
- But otherwise he's a grafter, eh?

972
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,641
- He loads the truck O.K.
I've trained him.

973
01:30:58,641 --> 01:31:00,241
He's not reliable though.

974
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:05,442
Where're you off to?
- To a pond.

975
01:31:06,142 --> 01:31:07,142
- Okay.

976
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:12,542
- He's mentally backward,
but no lunatic.

977
01:31:13,943 --> 01:31:16,344
He's moving to Prague
because you don't want him.

978
01:31:16,444 --> 01:31:17,944
You know that's the reason.

979
01:31:18,644 --> 01:31:20,944
You're the only one who can stop him.

980
01:31:21,444 --> 01:31:23,744
If someone's the only one who can,

981
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:25,745
he must do it.

982
01:31:26,346 --> 01:31:28,046
- I said when the harvest was over.

983
01:31:28,546 --> 01:31:29,946
The harvest is over.

984
01:31:30,446 --> 01:31:32,945
Tomorrow's the last day.
I'm through.

985
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,950
Good morning, comrade director.

986
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:04,751
I think it's not bad...

987
01:32:10,652 --> 01:32:15,552
- Quiet, Spot.
It's only some gentleman from Prague.

988
01:32:17,353 --> 01:32:18,753
They're going to renovate the place.

989
01:32:19,754 --> 01:32:21,254
Imported plastic thatching

990
01:32:21,554 --> 01:32:24,554
from West Germany.

991
01:32:26,454 --> 01:32:29,356
Tear down the W.C.

992
01:32:30,455 --> 01:32:32,655
They'll put in a flush toilet.

993
01:32:34,455 --> 01:32:36,455
What about the doorstep?
Concrete - that's it!

994
01:32:38,456 --> 01:32:40,557
What about an English lawn?

995
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:45,657
Yes, we will have an english lawn.
A swimming pool to take 3 strokes in...

996
01:32:49,058 --> 01:32:50,658
- Is it drinking water?

997
01:32:51,058 --> 01:32:52,558
- It is.

998
01:32:56,559 --> 01:32:58,660
Only now we have the mouth disease
around.

999
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,961
- Here we are...

1000
01:33:18,863 --> 01:33:21,063
We'll see you about the paperwork later.

1001
01:34:23,173 --> 01:34:24,673
Sold the house?

1002
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:20,381
They delivered a new car -
trying it out.

1003
01:35:26,383 --> 01:35:31,282
Boys - it drives of its own accord!
