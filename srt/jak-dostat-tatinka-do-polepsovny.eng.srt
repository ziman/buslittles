1
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:50,218
Children, before you hand in your drawings, be sure to sign your name.

2
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:56,661
But I still don't know where I'm going on holiday!

3
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:04,541
Vasek, what did you spend an hour drawing? Where are you going with your dad and mom?

4
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:09,058
Their honeymoon!

5
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:15,866
Why did you agree to such nonsense?

6
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:22,507
Going on holiday and not knowing where! What if you forget something you need?

7
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:27,602
You know what? I'll take everything I need and a bit more!

8
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:33,486
Lubos hasn't mentioned at all where you're going? At least you'd have an idea!

9
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:37,303
I have quite an accurate an idea!

10
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:45,504
I'll lie down on the grass and just sleep. Let Lubos enjoy our little child.

11
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:53,141
Sleep, you say? And for this you need a new wardrobe?

12
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:59,138
That's not all! I decided I'll be partying a lot.

13
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:07,380
No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning! I don't want to even see a kitchen.

14
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:14,727
~ Oh, you're going to Bermuda?
~ I deserve a bit of a rest!

15
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:21,977
All year it's just drill at the ballet hall, lots of stress at home and on the stage.

16
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,880
I want to live at last, too!

17
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:32,084
~ Isn't it perfect?
~ Sure it is! Perfect for a mountain tour!

18
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:38,947
~ What kind of tour?
~ Oh come on! Where did you meet? In the mountains.

19
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:44,188
- This year, you met again after eight years...
- ...after nine years.
- ...after nine years, where? In the mountains.

20
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:50,987
If you're saying Lubos is a snow man, he's not!

21
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,587
~ He was in Prague this spring.
~ He was, a few days.

22
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,180
Only to prepare an expedition to the Alps!

23
00:02:56,308 --> 00:03:01,557
~ And in the meantime, he's poking at the soil under the glacier.
~ So what?

24
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:06,843
Anna, you know you have a child with a chief of mountain rescue?

25
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,940
But otherwise, Lubos is normal!

26
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,365
If you assume he's going to put you on the train to the mountains, everything's fine.

27
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:23,727
Definitely not! We wrote to him three times insisting that we're not going to the mountains!

28
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:28,103
I'm not going to risk he'll turn Vasek into a climber!

29
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:34,477
~ What about sending Vasek with me to the cottage?
~ Absolutely not!

30
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,718
Do you even understand the situation you're in?

31
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:44,086
Starting to live with a man after eight years isn't easy.

32
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:47,737
Especially when you should get married ASAP.

33
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:54,519
First I'll get to know Lubos! Then I'll think about the wedding!

34
00:03:54,648 --> 00:04:01,599
What about Vasek? The marriage will have to be by the end holidays, before he goes back to school!

35
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:08,357
~ I've tripped a few times in my life! Now I have to decide properly!
~ Decide?

36
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:14,963
You're twenty-eight, you have an eight-year-old son, and when his father wants to marry you, you want to "think about it"?

37
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:20,663
What's to decide? Whether you're in love with him?

38
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:29,060
That hardly matters, but I just need to know I can rely on him.

39
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:38,581
Mom, why such a big suitcase? And where did you put those old pants?

40
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:44,181
Colombo, let that suitcase be.
And tidy up those things!

41
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:53,540
~ Why should I take those old pants?
~ To be able to climb the mountains.

42
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:58,941
~ Your father wrote that to you?
~ No, I came up with it myself!

43
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:07,066
~ What did he write you in the last letter?
~ That's a secret!

44
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:14,458
~ A great adventure awaits us!
~ Good! Now go wash!

45
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:21,107
~ Mommy, don't go anywhere!
~ Don't be silly?
~ But I won't be able to fall asleep!

46
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:27,542
Close your eyes and you can dream that our holiday begins tomorrow!

47
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:34,344
~ That we're all three together!
~ And when you wake up in the morning...
~ ...Dad's coming! ~ Yeah!

48
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,507
But I can't wait until the morning!

49
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:24,897
That was the nicest performance of the season!

50
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,603
I know!

51
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:31,138
Because it was the last!

52
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:42,739
Bozenka, did I leave the big blue towel lying there?

53
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,383
It's by the mirror or on the couch!

54
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:57,022
This is a very nice welcome, after 3 months!

55
00:06:57,148 --> 00:07:01,797
Haven't I imagined this moment a hundred times a day?!

56
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:07,302
I had no idea you would scream so nicely!

57
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:12,502
~ Why are there are seven beds?
~ Seven climbers!
~ Where are they?

58
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:18,447
~ Six on the train, and the seventh in the bathroom!
~ You could shower at home!

59
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:22,880
~ Vasek can't wait to see you!
~ And you can?

60
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:31,367
Me? What about me? I'll wait for you outside!

61
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:34,903
There's a bathroom!

62
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:45,738
You look like you did when you were seventeen!

63
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:52,580
Back then, I was nineteen and three months. Don't stare at me!

64
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:57,107
Finish up! I want to be out of here before the climbers get back.

65
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:04,847
~ Relax, the boys won't be here until the morning!
~ How is it that you're here?

66
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:11,701
~ Please don't mention it to Vasek! He'd be heartbroken.
~ Wait!

67
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:17,457
That's why you came early, to tell us you can't go on holiday with us?

68
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:26,147
No! I thought this night could be more than just the start of a holiday.

69
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:51,264
Dad! Dad's here!

70
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,743
Three, two, one!

71
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:03,066
~ Mom's asleep?
~ Like a log, but we'll get her up.

72
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:07,987
~ Leave that to me!
~ What's the surprise?
~ At the front of the house.

73
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:14,305
~ Are you packed? ~ I have a backpack.
~ And Mom? ~ She has a whole suitcase.

74
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:22,227
~ And your climbing gear? Do you have that?
~ Yeah, but don't tell Mom so that she doesn't panic!

75
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:42,537
~ Do I have to go home?
~ No, but you have to get up.

76
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:47,057
~ What time is it?
~ Past seven.

77
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:55,643
~ How did I get home?
~ Don't you remember anything?

78
00:09:55,768 --> 00:10:01,946
There! And for me the three hours were like an eternity without you!

79
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,484
Quiet! Vasek could wake up.

80
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:12,146
~ Mom, Mom, I got a new bike!
~ Maybe you behaved well.

81
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:16,506
~ You must have behaved well, too!
~ Why?
~ You got a bike as well!

82
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:22,498
~ A bike? What for?
~ So that you don't feel jealous.
~ That's what dad says.

83
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:30,325
What a silly idea to buy bikes before a holiday... do you want to lug them around on the train?

84
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:37,957
~ No, the train will only take your suitcase.
~ Huge suitcase! ~ What about us?
~ We'll go by bike.

85
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:43,457
~ Bikes, great!
~ Didn't I tell you?
~ No, you didn't tell me!

86
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:49,777
And the next time, don't even try. There's no way you two can get me on a bike!

87
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,704
Will there be wilderness?

88
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:45,378
~ Wilderness for you, paradise for Mom.
~ I'm so curious, I can't wait.

89
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:51,937
~ If we can ride tomorrow as far as today, we'll be there by the evening.
~ Are you kidding me?

90
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:58,143
I would also say that real adventure is rather farther.
In the Himalayas. Or in Africa.

91
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:06,177
~ Adventure is not anywhere. You have to have it in your blood.
~ I have that! ~ Me, too!

92
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:10,378
This means Mom doesn't have to ride the bike to Africa nor Asia.

93
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:13,502
Oh now I'm much happier.

94
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:18,978
People sometimes think the farther away from home you are, the greater the adventure.

95
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:25,666
~ But the greatest wonders of nature lie close by.
~ Maybe a boar! ~ Maybe.

96
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:30,326
Being able to look around is the secret of an adventurer!

97
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:37,618
- Tomorrow I'm looking around a hotel room and getting in a hot bath.
- It's not exactly a hotel...

98
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:40,605
I don't mind, at least there'll be a bathroom.

99
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:51,982
I hope you don't expect me to sleep under a tent the whole holidays.

100
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:57,958
Don't fret! You'll have a room that'll knock your eyes out!

101
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,963
I give up! Put up the tent!

102
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:09,585
~ I can't! You can't camp in a nature reserve.
~ What do you mean?

103
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:17,137
~ Are we going to spend the night in a tree?
~ Do you see that light?

104
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:26,863
~ Do you think they'll let us sleep there?
~ I'll go check it out!

105
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:33,340
I don't like knocking on strangers' doors.

106
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:38,546
Go with the flow!

107
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:52,383
Hello! Hello! Colombo here!

108
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,358
Where are you?

109
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,705
Help me, I can't get out!

110
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:11,183
~ What are you doing?
~ Lubos, hello!
~ Hey, Dad!

111
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:15,840
Folks, Krkonos Mountain has fallen! Our boy found his way home!

112
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,007
I came to show you my bride!

113
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:25,026
Bride? So then, welcome to our home!

114
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:33,000
Beník, he'll probably be my grandfather!

115
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:44,628
Make yourself at home... here's the living room and here's the kitchen!

116
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:50,584
As you can see, here you'll find everything you need!

117
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:59,426
This was my kingdom! Now it'll be yours!

118
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:02,904
A practical dresser...

119
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:08,427
For the second bed, I'll jump into the barn!

120
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:11,822
A perfect closet!

121
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:16,386
This is the room that'll make my eyes bug out?

122
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,666
~ You don't like it?
~ Terribly!

123
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:25,702
I can't be more amazed! I ride like a fool on a bike for two days.

124
00:16:25,828 --> 00:16:31,079
In the tent, ants crawl all over me, and now this? Is this the paradise of yours?

125
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:35,924
Everything's yet to come! The two of us will be alone here!

126
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:43,937
~ Can't you ever think of anything else?
~ Right now I just can't think at all!

127
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:48,822
It's going to be a great holiday!

128
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:56,724
~ Why doesn't it heat the water?
~ Because the stove doesn't work properly.

129
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,977
~ How doesn't the stove work properly?
~ The chimney's crooked!

130
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:05,446
~ Why is the chimney crooked?
~ Bloody hell, so much fuss around a bath.

131
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:12,243
~ Vasek, where are you? Into the house!
~ I hope the boy's not going to bathe in the tub?

132
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:18,744
~ Here you call *that* a tub?
~ Here, we wash under the pump.
~ So you've got the Middle Ages here.

133
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:26,104
~ What do you mean?
~ That this place hasn't been cleaned since the 30-year war.

134
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:36,818
~ Grandpa, look what I found in the loft!
~ I'm not your grandfather!

135
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:43,158
~ Check out these muscles!
~ Wow, you've got great muscles, Grandpa!

136
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:48,308
Listen, no boy has called me Grandpa, ever!

137
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:53,866
~ Why would a stranger boy call you that, Grandpa?
~ Are you not a stranger boy?

138
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,202
I'm yours!

139
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,823
I sure knew how to choose, didn't I?

140
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:06,467
~ Well, from the whole world, you couldn't have brought a greater treasure.
~ Don't say that!

141
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:12,663
~ Anna's got as much steam as a locomotive.
~ Keep your compliments and heat up the stove.

142
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:15,097
Well, I'll have to find the stove first.

143
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:20,746
~ What do you mean by "grandpa"?
~ Lubos is my dad.

144
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:27,103
His mom is my bride. No! My mom is his bride.

145
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:33,939
~ Shut your mouth and be quiet!
~ So you've got to be my grandfather. You see?

146
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:44,864
~ I'll be like your granddad.
~ Not like. You're already my real granddad!

147
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:51,143
~ Shut your mouth and be quiet!
~ Do you understand?
~ No!

148
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:59,628
No worries, Grandpa! The important thing is that you're glad you've got me.

149
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:05,937
I did wish for a grandson, but a man. Not a sissy!

150
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:11,426
~ I'm not a sissy.
~ You are! A big one!

151
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,336
Vasek!

152
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:21,246
You're not a sissy!

153
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,963
Jesus Christ!

154
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,997
What a man! Lubos, he's a great guy!

155
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,446
Lubos, look at the guy!

156
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:41,244
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?

157
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:47,339
This isn't a grandfather, it's Herod!

158
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:53,423
Anna, dear, the moon is full! It will be a beautiful summer night!

159
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:34,145
Here I am! I saved you a place in bed!

160
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:39,344
You're a good boy!

161
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:49,104
~ Don't wake my mom!
~ Why aren't you asleep?
~ I knew you'd come to me!

162
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,618
Just sleep, OK?

163
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:07,687
Daddy, when I'm thinking about something, I find it hard to sleep! You, too?

164
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:13,927
~ What are you thinking about now?
~ How to be a climber, when there aren't any mountains.

165
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:19,042
~ Wait until morning!
~ Are there some mountains around?
~ You'll see!

166
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:34,717
~ We'll start training in the morning?
~ Maybe now!
~ Really?

167
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,867
~ The correct mountaineer position now is to lie down and go to sleep.
~ It's not possible.

168
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:42,745
If so, the best climber in the world would be our mom!

169
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:45,457
~ So, the dragon loop! Now you!
~ There once was a princess.

170
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:51,663
She went to the pond, but a sprite emerged and pulled her under.

171
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:58,102
It looked like the back of a water sprite, but it was the dragon! That is why it's called a dragon loop.

172
00:22:58,228 --> 00:23:02,558
The knot should bind on the left. Now, not outwards.

173
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:05,297
Come on down! Home!

174
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:08,901
~ Is it time for breakfast?
~ We'll go after breakfast.

175
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:13,640
~ Where are we going?
~ Come on!
~ To the train station!

176
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:21,877
You've got another suitcase? Your shipment arrived this morning?

177
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:25,078
Is that kid making a fool out of me?

178
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm sure you're both fools. He's all yours.

179
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:44,938
~ I told you what to do and you do the exact opposite!
~ These aren't mountains.

180
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:50,781
No? I don't want to go to Krkonos Mountain and here I am by a rock at the cottage.

181
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:58,417
The most beautiful place is where we born! If you don't like...

182
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:06,182
Well, I was born elsewhere. I survived the room, grandpa!

183
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:09,267
But the boy will not be a climber!

184
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:15,587
I don't want to worry about a rock killing him. We're leaving!

185
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:22,180
We can't, Mom! Dad told grandpa we'd be here for half the holidays!

186
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:25,618
From now on, what I say goes!

187
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:33,862
No, Mom! Grandpa let me stay here! I'm friends with grandpa now.

188
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:37,742
I always wanted a grandpa. Mommy!

189
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:47,427
~ For half the holidays?
~ It doesn't matter, seeing how you are.

190
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:53,684
Listen, you two! You can do what you want on the land lower than the cottage.

191
00:24:53,708 --> 00:25:00,377
But if I catch you on a rock, I'll be furious! I'm serious!

192
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:07,884
~ Otherwise, it's over between us. Deal?
~ Depend on me! ~ Not me!

193
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,580
~ Well, we're leaving!
~ No!

194
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:17,401
All right, you can count on me!

195
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:31,259
~ Look, rocks.
~ Pedal!

196
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:41,400
~ There's a rock!
~ Come on!

197
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,247
There, too!

198
00:25:44,948 --> 00:25:50,068
~ Don't look and pick it up!
~ Here's the same rock.

199
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,465
Speed up!

200
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:03,921
Dad, wait! Just on the rock, then we'll go!

201
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:08,868
Don't! Are you trying to get me in trouble?

202
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:13,266
Dad, I'm made for the rocks!

203
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:19,463
~ Strength, intellect, agility, that's me.
~ But we promised.

204
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:26,046
But only about the rock by the pond. About the other rocks, we didn't promise.

205
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:30,347
Mom doesn't know the shortcut to the village.

206
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:36,498
You said that a good climber must overcome each obstacle.

207
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:42,660
~ Do you doubt me?
~ But our barrier is Mom.

208
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:48,127
I meant struggling against nature, not against your mom.

209
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:53,662
~ To have the joy of victory.
~ So I'm sure you'll have fun!

210
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:59,345
Overcoming mom, that's tougher than the 8,000 meter climb.

211
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:04,727
~ Where are you going with that jalopy?
~ To the dispensary.

212
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:07,985
It's my turn to show up with old Mána.

213
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:14,947
~ It's time for the veterans' parade again?
~ Yeah! And Mána must win!

214
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:23,418
~ It'll be enough if it charms like last year.
~ What did it win last year?
~ The prize! ~ What?

215
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:25,986
The very last place!

216
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:32,524
~ Watch out here, it's bumpy!
~ Don't worry!

217
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:42,341
~ Why is the rock called the Dragon's Tooth?
~ To scare us.

218
00:27:42,568 --> 00:27:49,377
I'm not scared of the Tooth, but I'm scared of Mom. Otherwise I would have climbed it.

219
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:54,745
Do you know what you want from me? What apology?

220
00:27:55,968 --> 00:28:02,062
Do you know how much uncertainty I had, since I had no father like other boys?

221
00:28:09,428 --> 00:28:15,918
~ I have an idea!
~ I know! We'll give mom the silent treatment until she gives in!
~ No!

222
00:28:16,048 --> 00:28:23,238
~ I'll try to get her to lift the ban.
~ Will you do it?

223
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:30,404
I'll do what I can! But you must leave your mother alone!

224
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,420
You can count on me!

225
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:39,464
Vasek! Vasek, Lubos!

226
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:47,199
~ Where are the boys?
~ They went shopping!

227
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:54,184
~ They're still not back yet?
~ They went back. They forgot bread and their backpack!

228
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:56,583
God knows what to think!

229
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:01,500
If they took a shortcut, I'll be waiting for them with dinner.

230
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:19,366
The shortcut will take about three hours. There's something funny going on here.

231
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:26,836
~ Where are the potatoes? They were here.
~ Weren't those moldy?

232
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:33,062
~ I threw them away.
~ We'll have to get some more, Pepa!

233
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:48,823
~ What's this?
~ It's Pepa.

234
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:54,980
~ I scrubbed the entire house.
~ Vasek likes wild boars.

235
00:29:55,108 --> 00:30:00,182
I annoyed three of the chairpersons before I got this winner.

236
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:05,905
~ A black pig is rare.
~ Mom, can't you see it!?

237
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:12,979
I have three guys around my neck and I have to worry about a pig! He said Bermuda!

238
00:30:13,008 --> 00:30:18,640
So this woman had such a poor childhood.

239
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:25,940
You should certainly not begrudge him. You don't know what he wants his soul.

240
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:32,101
I know! He'd like chimpanzees to swing on the chandelier in the bedroom.

241
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:36,985
I wanted to breed whales when I was his age.

242
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:42,299
That hardly surprises me. What he didn't inherit from his father you still have!

243
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:46,525
Has either one of you ever washed the floor?

244
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:54,262
So you didn't have to! You're single mother, I don't mind.

245
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:59,939
Who you got the baby with, I'm not interested. I'll quietly play grandfather.

246
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:04,107
But in this cottage, what the man says matters! And that man is me.

247
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:10,139
Anna! Anna!

248
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:14,062
Anna! Annie! Honey! I have an idea!

249
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:21,341
~ Where did you come by that?
~ You see that pine! Meet me there in ten minutes.

250
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:27,418
~ Am I playing hide and seek with you all?
~ No, just me.

251
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:32,383
Vasek's in the woods with grandpa getting beechnuts! Do you understand?

252
00:31:32,508 --> 00:31:37,882
~ No!
~ I sent them away.
~ Are you asking me on a date?

253
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:45,184
Honey, don't be surprised. I'm a world beater at 2 kilometers.

254
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:53,538
~ But I have muffins on the stove.
~ You know what I think? You know what I think?

255
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,862
About getting something to eat!

256
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:59,363
No, not here!

257
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:10,241
~ Mom, help! Mom!
~ This isn't Colombo, it's Juantorena.

258
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:14,227
Not this way! It'll track in dirt from the barn.

259
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:19,186
~ What did I promise you?
~ That you'd talk my mom into it.

260
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:24,223
~ What were you thinking?
~ That I'd been lost in the woods.

261
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:34,388
~ Grandpa, can we borrow Pepa?
~ Why, for playing?
~ No, to hunt wild boar.

262
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:38,560
It would be the highlight of the whole holiday.

263
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:45,797
~ Do you know how to go about it?
~ No! Grandpa has a plan.

264
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:49,264
I'm glad Pepa's tame.

265
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:54,858
~ Where are you, ants?
~ Grandpa, how would you do it?

266
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:57,627
I have three working tools:...

267
00:32:57,848 --> 00:33:05,463
a trained body, an obsession to test everything in the world, and strong nerves.

268
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:10,847
~ I can see that!
~ You're a climber?

269
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:16,637
Why are all the climbers looking at me? I'm a roofer.

270
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:20,304
So that rope in the loft's yours?

271
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:28,618
Come here, Detective, and tell me why is Lubos still running after your mom?

272
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:31,104
Dad's persuading Mom.

273
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:36,660
Today we definitely have to go out. You'd could come to the pond!

274
00:33:36,688 --> 00:33:43,480
~ I have to wait until Vasek falls asleep.
~ He'll drop off soon, he's pretty tired.

275
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:47,901
~ Where did you get the sugar?
~ In the shop.

276
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:54,176
There are goods in that anthill? Maybe next time I'll go there with you.

277
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:59,600
~ Shut your mouth and come to bed quickly.
~ Not to bed!

278
00:33:59,728 --> 00:34:06,306
~ Can't you hear me? Not another word, let's go!
~ Mom!

279
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:17,984
When Anna discovers that you climb on the rocks with the kid, you wouldn't be here an hour.

280
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:23,226
~ It would upset you?
~ No, but what if you take the kid?

281
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:26,977
We don't have to see him, you know.

282
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:32,546
If this bothers you, just go to sleep!

283
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,426
Lubos!

284
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:58,585
Lubos!

285
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:17,776
~ Lubos, what did Anna do with the whale?
~ With what whale?

286
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:22,082
I thought I brought up a real man.

287
00:35:22,108 --> 00:35:27,259
~ If you knew Anna was expecting your baby, would you accept that?
~ Of course I would!

288
00:35:27,688 --> 00:35:33,121
That's what I like! Because the guy who does not care about his child...

289
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:37,676
~ wouldn't get my hand.
~ But I didn't know.

290
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:56,425
I've had enough!

291
00:35:56,548 --> 00:36:03,377
~ I can tan your butt!
~ If you knew how scared I was today.

292
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:08,059
I could have fallen asleep sooner than Mom, but I resisted.

293
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:14,321
It's clear now! At night you don't have to wait for me.

294
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:21,718
~ I'm taking this.
~ What?
~ The sugar!

295
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:25,423
~ Why?
~ To protect it from the ants.

296
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:33,582
~ What are you thinking?
~ I'm scared to go shopping with Mom.

297
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:40,427
Just now that I'm starting to climb well, I don't want it all to come to a screeching halt.

298
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:46,345
Oh, come on, silly! Forget the ants!

299
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:52,687
And remember! A real man is fearless.

300
00:36:55,348 --> 00:37:02,220
Oh, so you've already talked to Mom?

301
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:09,402
I haven't succeeded yet.

302
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:18,761
Don't be sad! I'm sure you'll talk to her. I believe in you.

303
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:29,283
What if I left Anna here with Vasek through the holidays?

304
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:34,622
~ You don't want to take her with you?
~ Anna doesn't want to hear about old Krkonos.

305
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:40,298
~ Since I won't be here.
~ And what does Anna think?

306
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:46,744
~ Nothing, she doesn't know about it!
~ I'm not going to get involved!

307
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:53,137
You don't have to, especially when you sleep with Vasek for the night.

308
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:57,785
You'll be worried in the morning.

309
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:06,967
~ And when's the wedding?
~ We're still planning it!

310
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:12,100
~ You're so old fashioned.
~ You two are very modern!

311
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:19,543
~ You have an eight-year-old child and you're planning a wedding.
~ We knew each other for ten days.

312
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:25,743
We only met up again this year. We ran into each other at the ski resort.

313
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:31,557
~ Suddenly I have an eight-year-old boy.
~ Save this story for Vasek.

314
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:34,624
I want you to have the boy on paper.

315
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:41,999
I'll still be adopting my own child. After all, she sleeps with me!

316
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:44,942
She will, but only after the wedding!

317
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:51,461
I'll start believing in miracles. Remember that night in Cinderella?

318
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:58,027
~ I liked Cinderella!
~ You picked the ants out of the sugar? Why?

319
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:05,181
~ So you wouldn't go shopping with us.
~ Why shouldn't I go with you?

320
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:10,065
~ Vasek thought...
~ No interpreting, I'll listen to the original.

321
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:16,497
I thought that you could sleep in the daytime. You deserve a rest.

322
00:39:17,808 --> 00:39:23,898
~ We've got us a nice boy, don't you think?
~ Let's go shopping again today, OK, Dad?

323
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:30,303
~ We can skip it.
~ What about milk? I want milk!

324
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:36,505
Do you understand that? He's always had a sensitivity to milk. Listen...

325
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:41,704
~ can we drink grandpa's fresh milk?
~ No!

326
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:46,821
~ Dad said that good...
~ Don't strain those hands!

327
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:50,397
They must drink a pint of milk a day.

328
00:39:50,428 --> 00:39:55,861
What are you doing listening to this guy?

329
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:08,662
You have tremendous influence over him.

330
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,181
"Climbers, climbers, climbers...

331
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:18,745
"with three strong pitons.

332
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:25,057
"He'll fall in the sand of his native village, and we'll see him no more...

333
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,507
"doo-dah."

334
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:31,785
You do remember your promise? No rock climbing!

335
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:37,521
~ On the rock!
~ No, on the rocks!
~ Today we're not going anywhere.

336
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:45,024
~ We'll help mother by peeling potatoes.
~ No, no potatoes! I want milk!

337
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:51,018
~ I'll drink it by the liter.
~ What if Vasek goes shopping alone?

338
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:55,346
Your father and I could manage, just the two of us.

339
00:40:56,568 --> 00:41:00,238
Anna, you're just great!

340
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:06,207
If you like peeling potatoes, I might as well go alone.

341
00:41:06,828 --> 00:41:09,786
It won't work! He can't go alone!

342
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:17,501
~ No short cuts back to the road.
~ Why not?

343
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:23,146
Mom didn't lift the ban, so we get commended.

344
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:30,004
I like praise, don't you? Hey, Mána!

345
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:34,428
Out of the way! Look out!

346
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:43,736
~ Can I look at Mána?
~ No, I can't stop.

347
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:49,303
~ What's Mána do at a fire?
~ No one knows!

348
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:56,282
~ Up until yesterday, we climbed the rocks.
~ I thought I could convince Mom.

349
00:41:56,508 --> 00:42:01,404
You have to try harder. Look at me, I'll never give up.

350
00:42:01,528 --> 00:42:04,877
Before you get angry, think about Mom.

351
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:10,061
~ Why?
~ You'll be better off!

352
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:16,140
As of yesterday, we were barred the rock by the pond.

353
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:23,026
~ But this morning we're banned everywhere!
~ My mom always prohibits something.

354
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:29,924
She never let me say I was looking for a dad! Now she's glad to have you!

355
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:35,266
She'll be happy to see that I'm able to do it like you.

356
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:40,018
~ You know what I see? Snakes!
~ Where?
~ Next to each other.

357
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:53,460
I'll check it out.

358
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:59,739
Now, Vasek, remember what I said. Three strong pitons!

359
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:02,826
Good pitons.

360
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,421
Careful now! Hands up!

361
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:16,864
Now pick up the loop!

362
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:22,862
Hold it in your left hand and with the right grasp the knot.

363
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,820
Good! Like that!

364
00:44:30,508 --> 00:44:36,617
At the bottom it won't work, you've gotten up here. You've got some slack.

365
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:42,018
That's right!

366
00:44:45,468 --> 00:44:50,578
Replace your hands! Now rotate around the corner.

367
00:44:54,748 --> 00:45:01,246
Come on! Good! Dude!

368
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:09,259
Lubos, a double fracture! His ribs in a cast.

369
00:45:09,388 --> 00:45:15,421
~ Hovorka's in the hospital.
~ Where?
~ I don't know! I can't concentrate!

370
00:45:15,548 --> 00:45:22,226
~ Here's the info. Stop!
~ When?
~ You can't walk up.

371
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:30,341
~ What happened, Dad?
~ Well, buddy, that's the breaks!

372
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:40,878
You know what I wish? That I could have those eight years back.

373
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:47,917
~ Vasek didn't like being with me very much.
~ Understandable! There's something I want to tell you.

374
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:54,760
I thought you were irresponsible! Now I know that you keep your word.

375
00:45:55,388 --> 00:46:01,305
I still checked at the rock by the pond. I suspected you unfairly.

376
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:05,778
~ I'm not saying a thing.
~ Explain how you got back all right...

377
00:46:06,108 --> 00:46:09,724
while Vasek and Grandpa were chasing a wild boar?

378
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:14,436
Because the only wild boar is our grandpa!

379
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:18,558
But when you go shopping, someone always comes back with torn pants!

380
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:25,004
~ And you always came back tired.
~ What's wrong with Vasek?

381
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:29,785
~ Nothing! He fell asleep!
~ Nothing? You say it just like that?

382
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:39,480
We've been waiting a long time for this moment. Are you sure you just want to talk?

383
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:45,578
~ You wanted to say something to me.
~ Later! This is important!

384
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:51,478
~ That's why we only see each other at lunch and dinner.
~ And breakfast.

385
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:58,047
You think I enjoy sitting when you do all that guy stuff all day.

386
00:46:58,468 --> 00:47:03,007
I'm hardly enjoying myself when I'm on my own.

387
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:15,146
Damnit! How do they do this in other families?

388
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:19,978
They must have special training about people.

389
00:47:20,808 --> 00:47:26,627
~ I guess they have a grandpa who keeps office hours.
~ What are you doing, Dad?

390
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:33,221
I took a day off, kids! I've never done that before.

391
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:40,618
So much the better! Grandpa can go shopping with the kid.

392
00:47:40,748 --> 00:47:50,477
~ And we'll finally have time for ourselves.
~ Mommy! Mommy!

393
00:47:52,148 --> 00:48:00,906
What are you doing? Mom, Dad's trying to see how long he can stay under water?

394
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:05,606
~ Leave your father alone and go on out!
~ Grandpa!

395
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:10,097
My dad invented a new game, we need a stopwatch!

396
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:17,580
When I whistle, leaves begin to fall from the trees.

397
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:23,078
That's nothing! When I whistle, branches begin to crack.

398
00:48:23,508 --> 00:48:29,141
That's nothing at all. When I whistle, flies drop out of the air!

399
00:48:29,268 --> 00:48:32,897
~ Well, you win!
~ Why not me?

400
00:48:33,028 --> 00:48:38,864
You could come back and maybe we would have died of hunger.

401
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:44,301
~ Against the enemy we send...
~ The most reliable!

402
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:51,379
~ Be careful not to get captured!
~ Grandpa, who are we fighting against?

403
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:54,022
~ Who's the enemy?
~ Mom.

404
00:48:54,148 --> 00:49:01,423
~ So mom will be our enemy!
~ I'm against that!
~ I'm for!

405
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:09,058
I was talking with Kosem. You'll get married in the village. I'll write the wedding speech myself.

406
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:14,704
I'll casually mention Venda and the rocks.

407
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:20,779
Anna will be thrilled to hear about the wedding speech, it's not necessary...

408
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:23,166
to mention Venda and the rocks.

409
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:28,220
For the moment, she won't know what's been agreed.

410
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:34,081
~ And you stick to the wedding, no rocks!
~ Why do you want all the paperwork?

411
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,082
You're hardly a stickler for the rules.

412
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:41,822
Even though we climbed, you never had consent.

413
00:49:42,248 --> 00:49:48,023
My mom freaked, too. But we were climbing, but now I've got to pack.

414
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:55,162
You won't stay here even until the end of July? What does Anna think?

415
00:49:55,588 --> 00:50:00,902
~ Nothing!
~ She still doesn't know anything?
~ I don't want to ruin her last week.

416
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:07,900
~ No way! You can't leave before the wedding!
~ Focus on the pigeon loft!

417
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:10,516
Have the wedding before you leave!

418
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:23,222
Vasek, what are you doing up a tree again?

419
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:27,583
Come on, get down!

420
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:47,183
~ Who's the gingerbread for?
~ You'll say you caught me? I have to take it.

421
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:51,722
~ I didn't say you couldn't.
~ Not you! Dad and grandpa did!

422
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:54,104
They said I couldn't get caught.

423
00:51:54,228 --> 00:51:58,858
We have a new fighting game, and it has strict rules.

424
00:51:58,988 --> 00:52:05,460
~ Take what you'll eat and leave the rest at home!
~ But they're hungry, too.

425
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:10,787
~ Why isn't Daddy coming home to eat?
~ It's a secret! Listen!

426
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:17,382
~ He wanted to come home, but he's afraid.
~ Afraid? Of what?

427
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:21,427
That you wouldn't let him go out until after dinner.

428
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:41,342
Dinner's in the oven. You can help yourself.

429
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:44,904
~ And what is it?
~ Noodles with poppy seeds!
~ Wow!

430
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:50,557
Have you told Anna you're leaving? It seems strange, somehow.

431
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:57,103
~ You told Mom that I like you, didn't you?
~ You're good, both of you!

432
00:52:57,228 --> 00:53:00,727
You're giving me tasks, but I've got my worries.

433
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:08,606
~ If you want, you can all sleep in the kitchen.
~ Since you're getting married!

434
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:26,539
Vasek!

435
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:50,983
~ What are you doing?
~ Having a party.

436
00:54:57,988 --> 00:55:05,144
~ Alone?
~ No, I have company. Pepa.

437
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:14,265
Keep an eye out for Vasek. He took down those clothespins.

438
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:19,444
Be quiet when you see Vasek, he can't see me.

439
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:24,537
~ This is the law of optics, darling.
~ He has binoculars.

440
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:33,902
~ I wonder who gave it to him?
~ Do you know where?
~ Around the chimney.

441
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:39,598
These are silly jokes! We're finally alone and you're pouting.

442
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:46,587
~ Go where you heart leads.
~ If it were up to me, I'd always be with you.

443
00:55:46,608 --> 00:55:52,480
~ I also have my duties.
~ Yes! Continuous working time.

444
00:55:53,508 --> 00:56:00,180
If you left grandpa with a boy in the woods, you'd come up with something, right?

445
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:07,283
~ Oh no!
~ Yes! Besides, you played with them half the night.
~ Trying to get them sleepy.

446
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,206
But you'd locked the door. I knocked to get in.

447
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:18,485
~ At half past eleven!
~ You were waiting for me? If only I had known.

448
00:56:19,348 --> 00:56:22,384
If I had known.

449
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:28,918
~ What are you doing with that towel?
~ I'm hot when you're angry at me.

450
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:32,245
I'm still mad at you.

451
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:38,223
What are you doing with that? Tell me!

452
00:56:39,048 --> 00:56:43,742
Not here! We have to sneak off somewhere.

453
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:48,622
If you've had enough teasing, go pick someone else.

454
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:57,701
~ Shall we go higher?
~ What if we get near your grandfather?

455
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:01,882
~ Don't worry!
~ I don't like saltiness!

456
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:09,382
~ Have courage.
~ Why are we watching grandpa there?

457
00:57:09,508 --> 00:57:15,984
~ I think he wants to play with us.
~ Why can't he go climbing with us?

458
00:57:16,008 --> 00:57:21,678
After climbing on the roofs throughout the year, he's looking for other entertainment.

459
00:57:22,408 --> 00:57:27,006
Damn! Everywhere there's just jam or compôte.

460
00:57:27,428 --> 00:57:30,657
The woman will be making more jam and stuff.

461
00:57:30,788 --> 00:57:35,100
I want to find a mug and I get a compass.

462
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:40,798
You'd better take a compass into the woods and find a game for two.

463
00:57:40,928 --> 00:57:46,343
I'd be grateful if you'd take the boy and give Lubos a moment with me.

464
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:51,822
~ I'm working on it.
~ What are you doing?

465
00:57:52,548 --> 00:57:57,241
~ Looking for a Halloween costume.
~ A Halloween costume.
~ Yeah!

466
00:57:57,748 --> 00:58:06,543
~ Here we go. What do you think?
~ Where did you get that horrible outfit?

467
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:12,980
This is a family tradition. The last time, we scared Lubos.

468
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:19,980
~ The boy will be thrilled, won't he?
~ I see it. I'm terribly frightened.

469
00:58:20,408 --> 00:58:25,421
~ And you say thrilled.
~ Women! They never understand.

470
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:29,646
The boy will have a memory for life.

471
00:58:30,028 --> 00:58:35,166
"Close your eyes, Anna, you authorize the rope...

472
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:39,239
"get out a bit to the right, below us is the design,...

473
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:46,823
~ "Bump, this time it went well..."
~ Slack off! Give me some slack.

474
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:53,825
~ I loosened the rope!
~ Can you see where it's stuck?

475
00:58:57,708 --> 00:59:01,538
I see! It jammed there at a crack.

476
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:07,838
~ I'm going up there!
~ Don't move! Don't you dare! I'm coming right down.

477
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:23,696
Daddy!

478
00:59:24,388 --> 00:59:26,504
Dad!

479
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:29,096
Daddy!

480
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:33,386
Hold on! I'll go for help!

481
00:59:33,548 --> 00:59:35,808
Help! Grandpa!

482
00:59:35,928 --> 00:59:39,443
~ Don't move, Vasek!
~ Help!

483
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:42,828
~ Get back, Vasek!
~ Help!

484
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:46,944
Help! Grandpa!

485
00:59:47,608 --> 00:59:53,157
Grandpa, help! Grandpa!

486
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:58,219
~ Dad's hanging on a rock.
~ Which one?

487
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:00,767
Dragon's Tooth!

488
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:04,863
Mom, help! Water Goblin!

489
01:00:08,148 --> 01:00:11,140
~ What's wrong with dad?
~ Hanging.

490
01:00:11,268 --> 01:00:17,946
I told you, Grandpa! This child of yours got a shock.

491
01:01:04,308 --> 01:01:08,426
Fanda, look out! Out of the way!

492
01:01:10,068 --> 01:01:12,628
What is it?

493
01:01:19,448 --> 01:01:22,918
A water goblin, and he called me Fanda?

494
01:01:24,628 --> 01:01:29,918
That guy scared me. What are you doing?

495
01:01:30,048 --> 01:01:36,020
No problem, I still had a rock in my hand. Still, I wish the boy'd listened to me.

496
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:41,222
Why would he listen? You disobey me, too!

497
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:46,217
Don't worry! Your jokes are stupid!

498
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:49,420
Damn! Our Mom!

499
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:53,746
Anna, honey! Where did you come from?

500
01:01:55,028 --> 01:02:00,546
~ You are nice scammers!
~ I'm not! I'm just a sprite!

501
01:02:00,668 --> 01:02:06,777
~ This is where you go shopping?
~ No, we're on our way shopping!

502
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:10,823
~ What are you doing here?
~ Here...

503
01:02:13,548 --> 01:02:20,976
~ This is on the way, Daddy.
~ Yeah! It's on the way. You know...

504
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:28,946
What's this, clothesline? I forbade you to climb rocks. You promised!

505
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:33,141
~ Don't shout!
~ What was that?

506
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:36,704
I confess, I climbed up.

507
01:02:36,828 --> 01:02:44,640
I wanted to show off in front of the kid. I'm a conceited idiot!

508
01:02:45,368 --> 01:02:48,121
What about Vasek?

509
01:02:48,948 --> 01:02:52,600
Vasek? He was watching me.

510
01:02:53,428 --> 01:02:57,297
You expect me to believe that Vasek sat and just watched?

511
01:02:57,328 --> 01:03:00,826
You should trust me. He's my child!

512
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:04,360
~ With me, nothing will happen to him!
~ Be reasonable!

513
01:03:04,408 --> 01:03:09,424
If the boy had been up there, too, he wouldn't have needed any help.

514
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:13,679
I believe you, Grandpa! And when you kill yourself on the rock, I won't care.

515
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:25,507
Don't be sad, Dad! Mom spoke the truth.

516
01:03:25,628 --> 01:03:32,523
~ Do you think she would shed a tear for me?
~ A whole stream. Absolutely!

517
01:03:40,928 --> 01:03:45,383
I wonder how Anna now shall flow with you to the altar?

518
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:52,027
Have you told her that you're leaving in the middle of the summer?

519
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:56,220
Lubos!

520
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:01,544
Don't worry, I'll work it all out!

521
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:08,101
Be careful, everyone. What do you see here?

522
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:13,985
~ This is a general plan of attack.
~ What are we attacking?

523
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:18,287
Leave the cakes alone, or there won't be any for dinner.

524
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:22,138
Do you think I'm going to eat what they cook?

525
01:04:22,368 --> 01:04:27,181
~ Grandpa, listen to what the chief says.
~ Grandpa is to go north.

526
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:32,236
Around the Stone Snake cross to the Dancer.

527
01:04:33,468 --> 01:04:36,581
Your mother will go to the south, along the creek upstream.

528
01:04:36,808 --> 01:04:42,758
Vasek will follow the footsteps of grandfather and I'll track Mom.

529
01:04:45,688 --> 01:04:51,827
~ My dad has just the best games!
~ Around three, we'll meet here!

530
01:04:52,048 --> 01:04:56,420
And we then come back home together. In the evening we'll have scoring, prizes.

531
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:59,618
For stamina and the like!

532
01:05:00,748 --> 01:05:03,387
What if mom gets lost?

533
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:07,126
It'll be best if the three of us all track her.

534
01:05:07,248 --> 01:05:12,964
Colombo, you're going north! I can do it myself!

535
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:18,479
Oh! I understand!

536
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:25,305
~ What are you doing? Did you slice the cucumbers?
~ My muffins.

537
01:05:30,348 --> 01:05:35,980
Just you dude, you just don't give up! You're all mine!

538
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:41,947
Don't tell me! I understand about your shopping and the ants.

539
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:46,505
Vasek followed you on the rocks every day! He gave you away.

540
01:05:47,428 --> 01:05:53,139
~ So Vasek could watch.
~ Hardly a big sacrifice.

541
01:05:53,268 --> 01:05:57,441
After all, you climbed on the rocks for your pleasure, in this heat?

542
01:05:57,568 --> 01:06:04,997
I feel guilty about what I did, but also for what I didn't do.

543
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,803
I can never give back to Vasek what I owe him!

544
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:11,361
Eight years of life.

545
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:21,707
In August, I'd go anywhere with you. Even on a bicycle to Krkonos Mountain.

546
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:27,343
~ I'd rather stay here with Grandpa.
~ The wedding could be here on Tuesday!

547
01:06:27,468 --> 01:06:31,097
It doesn't matter where the wedding is.

548
01:06:31,628 --> 01:06:36,907
It matters! Grandpa and the kid should be happy!

549
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:41,643
Today's Sunday, I'll write a letter to my mother on Monday. I'll have it off by noon.

550
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:46,819
~ Friday, and the wedding can be on Saturday.
~ Not sooner?

551
01:06:46,948 --> 01:06:57,966
~ Why?
~ There's something you don't know. I'll explain all this!

552
01:06:58,288 --> 01:07:00,882
Don't say anything now!

553
01:07:24,308 --> 01:07:29,826
Grandpa, this is no game! Dad shouldn't give Mom any hints at all.

554
01:07:29,948 --> 01:07:33,060
None, but he's carrying her.

555
01:07:33,188 --> 01:07:35,781
So let them! In the evening we'll deduct points.

556
01:07:35,808 --> 01:07:42,784
You broke the route. You should be at the crossroads, not the cemetery.

557
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:53,937
Don't grumble, here's where grandma rests. Too bad she didn't live with luck.

558
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:56,584
What luck?

559
01:07:56,708 --> 01:08:02,781
You have some luck, Grandpa? Hiding? Right?

560
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:17,324
~ Grandpa! Grandpa!
~ You see, I'm happy! The boy's pulling such a stunt.

561
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:21,704
He probably is really ours!

562
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,699
Now I don't know what to think.

563
01:08:31,668 --> 01:08:37,967
~ Repeat, Colombo went to the North.
~ Colombo went to the North.

564
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:46,945
Somebody's breathing here.

565
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:58,361
~ Don't turn around! This isn't Colombo.
~ It's Pepa.
~ It's not Pepa.

566
01:08:59,008 --> 01:09:02,023
It's a wild boar!

567
01:09:08,668 --> 01:09:11,660
Too bad it's not Venda.

568
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:21,337
~ Mom, we'll be walking to the wedding?
~ So what? You'd rather we had to ride a bike?

569
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:29,087
~ That's not a bad idea!
~ I'll do even better! I'll get you a great ride!

570
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:33,138
~ Grandpa, hell no!
~ For Mána it'll be a great honor.

571
01:09:33,268 --> 01:09:35,702
How's this? I've got a better idea!

572
01:09:37,228 --> 01:09:44,616
~ But I don't know just what kind yet.
~ I'm relieved.

573
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:50,756
~ Lubos, save it for the wedding!
~ But this left us just a few steps away from the top!

574
01:09:50,888 --> 01:09:57,524
~ There! And my dad won't try?
~ Careful! Otherwise he'll carry you off to the pen with Pepa!

575
01:09:57,848 --> 01:10:00,442
And I warn you one last time!

576
01:10:07,688 --> 01:10:13,841
Grandpa! Have you seen the guys?

577
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,786
They went shopping in the morning but never even went to the store.

578
01:10:16,808 --> 01:10:21,027
~ I've got a letter for my mother.
~ How did you find your way to the village?

579
01:10:21,948 --> 01:10:27,705
~ The road. There were ants in the sugar again.
~ You know what?

580
01:10:27,828 --> 01:10:32,902
There's the mail box, the sugar, so go on home.

581
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:35,906
~ What about the guys?
~ We'll handle this alone.

582
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:39,100
Mána's crew wishes good health to the bride.

583
01:10:39,228 --> 01:10:44,666
~ I brought Voves.
~ Wolf, the head of the pigs' nursery.

584
01:10:44,788 --> 01:10:49,286
We're here to be witnesses. Kos, our president.

585
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:55,084
~ Tomorrow I dress in black.
~ Why black?
~ There's a wedding, right?

586
01:10:55,108 --> 01:10:59,920
~ Tomorrow?
~ It's Tuesday, right?
~ Sure, it's Tuesday!

587
01:11:00,748 --> 01:11:04,560
~ You're having a wedding.
~ But the wedding will be on Saturday.

588
01:11:04,688 --> 01:11:08,187
~ On Saturday, no!
~ On Saturday, definitely not.
~ Why not?

589
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:14,257
~ Lubos didn't tell you? The whole village knows.
~ What?

590
01:11:14,788 --> 01:11:19,304
~ He's leaving Wednesday.
~ Who?
~ Lubos, of course!

591
01:11:20,228 --> 01:11:22,867
~ The day after tomorrow?
~ Yeah, at noon.

592
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:26,217
~ At noon he definitely's going away.
~ Where?

593
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:32,160
~ Mountaineers are having an exercise.
~ In the Carpathians.

594
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:37,262
He also said that there'll also be Poles, Germans, and Soviets.

595
01:11:37,688 --> 01:11:41,704
~ And Romanians.
~ Romanians, too, that's for sure!

596
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:46,717
~ How long will he be there, did he say?
~ They say until the end of the holidays.

597
01:11:46,948 --> 01:11:51,497
~ He'll be back in September.
~ Leave it, she doesn't know what's going on!

598
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:56,102
I guess I've spoken out of turn. Do you know about a mountaineering exercise?

599
01:11:56,228 --> 01:12:00,540
~ Grandpa!
~ He didn't tell you? I'll tear him to pieces!

600
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:11,101
~ What happened here?
~ Nothing! Lubos is lost.
~ Who? ~ The groom.

601
01:12:11,688 --> 01:12:16,337
Anna, I'll fix it! Everything will be fine.

602
01:12:16,468 --> 01:12:20,984
Take the shortcut. The pub's to the right.

603
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:23,463
Not the shortcut!

604
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:26,546
Come on, crank it up!

605
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:05,241
~ Congratulations! ~ We did it!
~ Now you really are the best! I'm so happy for you.

606
01:13:05,568 --> 01:13:11,677
~ At one point I almost cried.
~ But you did it!

607
01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:16,184
~ It feels like a fairy tale.
~ Why?

608
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:18,866
Look at this beauty!

609
01:13:28,268 --> 01:13:35,218
~ No signs, just the sun... ~ Rock...
~ Dragon's Tooth... ~ And the two of us!

610
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:45,199
~ Can you hear that, Dad, Mána!? Is there a fire?
~ Yeah! Directly below us.

611
01:13:45,908 --> 01:13:49,157
Mom, I'm here!

612
01:13:49,548 --> 01:13:53,426
~ I'm a climber like my dad.
~ Be quiet!

613
01:13:53,548 --> 01:13:56,620
Vasek! Vasek!

614
01:13:57,148 --> 01:13:59,767
I did it!!

615
01:13:59,988 --> 01:14:03,264
Guys, watch out, Mom!

616
01:14:06,268 --> 01:14:10,637
~ Grandpa, how will they get down?
~ Down the rope.

617
01:14:10,668 --> 01:14:15,900
~ The rope!
~ Don't look there!
~ Bring me the boy!

618
01:14:16,028 --> 01:14:21,658
~ Maybe the ladder.
~ The ladder. Deploy the ladder.

619
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:25,740
No, Mom, not a ladder! We are climbers!

620
01:14:25,868 --> 01:14:31,067
~ It will be chancy!
~ The Conqueror of picturesque mountains on the ladder.

621
01:14:31,188 --> 01:14:37,707
~ It'll be our honor, Mána.
~ Providing a rescue for the chief.

622
01:14:37,828 --> 01:14:41,287
~ Chief...
~ Mountain Rescue Service..

623
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:46,823
~ It doesn't work.
~ Why not?
~ It's stuck!

624
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:54,024
~ Turn it again.
~ But the other way around.
~ What happened here? I do not know.

625
01:14:54,148 --> 01:15:00,383
So! Someone says something and you spread it around the village via express.

626
01:15:00,508 --> 01:15:06,299
~ We'll rescue the chief with the ladder.
~ Lubos? The two of you?

627
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:14,062
~ He's hurt?
~ No! Why?
~ Otherwise, he'd climb down the rope like that boy over there.

628
01:15:14,188 --> 01:15:21,626
~ Vasek, wait!
~ Andrés, no! They deserve praise!

629
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:25,866
Dad, watch out, it's Mom!

630
01:15:26,428 --> 01:15:30,479
Urchin, I'll spank you so hard you won't sit down for a week.

631
01:15:30,508 --> 01:15:34,103
Lubos, down!

632
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:42,602
Now it will be exciting: if the storm gets even the chief.

633
01:15:42,928 --> 01:15:47,060
~ The Mom looks pretty well?
~ Yeah!

634
01:15:51,808 --> 01:15:55,547
Lubos, come on! You're losing your bride.

635
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:49,003
Anna! Anna!

636
01:16:53,928 --> 01:16:56,488
Anna!

637
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:58,805
Honey!

638
01:17:07,528 --> 01:17:13,018
I promised Vasek! Nothing will happen to him!

639
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,661
I take it on my conscience!

640
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,097
He's my son!

641
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:32,782
Anna, forgive me! We'll never do it again.

642
01:17:32,908 --> 01:17:42,177
Don't do that! Vasek is looking forward to the fun, my dad's broken-hearted.

643
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:45,223
I'll get a shock!

644
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:50,258
I said I wouldn't go on a bike, but I went!

645
01:17:50,688 --> 01:17:54,461
I didn't want to stay here, but I stayed!

646
01:17:54,588 --> 01:17:58,818
I wanted to use and enjoy life at the stove!

647
01:17:58,948 --> 01:18:02,703
You fell in love with me, you can't live without me.

648
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:07,966
~ So it doesn't matter whether the wedding's on Tuesday or Saturday.
~ Wedding? What wedding?

649
01:18:08,388 --> 01:18:10,583
The wedding will never be!

650
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:16,683
You seemed to be a great dad. But you're a liar and a criminal.

651
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:21,680
Like any normal guy!

652
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,685
There you are! Not a letter, not a card, nothing!

653
01:18:35,108 --> 01:18:38,547
~ And here I am, covered in thorns, and you don't even care!
~ Don't get upset!

654
01:18:39,468 --> 01:18:43,381
No, there was no point in coming --- the wedding's off.

655
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:49,958
Why off? The rascal won't marry you?

656
01:18:50,288 --> 01:18:52,644
I don't want to!

657
01:18:52,988 --> 01:18:55,303
Surely you can't do this to Vasek.

658
01:18:55,428 --> 01:19:01,124
This all means his mom hasn't decided to get married yet?

659
01:19:01,948 --> 01:19:06,466
I've decided! I don't care what Vasek will say!!

660
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:13,960
But I want him to stay alive! No one may threaten the life of my children.

661
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:22,002
What children? You specifically told him what you wanted!

662
01:19:22,128 --> 01:19:31,726
~ But he ignored it. Instead he took him up the Dragon's Tooth!
~ Above all, you love him.

663
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:39,184
I don't want to see him anymore. He let me down!

664
01:19:39,728 --> 01:19:46,167
~ When I saw them climbing rocks.
~ You don't get it, girl!

665
01:19:46,388 --> 01:19:49,086
When a man is not a man, he's boring.

666
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:54,860
Drivers or skydivers risk their lives every day.

667
01:19:55,388 --> 01:20:02,507
~ In contrast, climbing is a safe sport.
~ For bad men!

668
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:07,466
~ They absolutely don't appreciate life.
~ It's not risky with Lubos.

669
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:15,178
There's only one dangerous profession. Being a male! The boy needs to learn how!

670
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:21,365
~ So embrace him!
~ How? Along with broken ribs?

671
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:26,126
He's never coming back at all? He'll never accept that.

672
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:49,597
~ Wow, Dad and Grandpa!
~ Three, two, one, zero, hop!

673
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:56,298
~ So how did I do? Great?
~ You're the wisest.

674
01:20:56,428 --> 01:21:00,865
Prague has fifty schools and you find the right one!

675
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:04,947
Grandpa couldn't even find his way out of the station.

676
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,420
Don't trust him, Vasek!

677
01:21:06,448 --> 01:21:13,137
~ But now we have to correct the mistake.
~ How's life at home?

678
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:18,422
~ I'm in hell! What about Pepa?
~ Forget Pepa. What about Mom?

679
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:22,177
~ Still angry?
~ More and more!

680
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:26,540
~ Does she talk with you?
~ Less and less!
~ Bloody hell!

681
01:21:26,668 --> 01:21:32,300
In the morning, she gets up, goes to the bathroom and closes the door, and's in there for an hour!

682
01:21:32,728 --> 01:21:38,197
~ What's she doing for an hour?
~ Sitting in the bath and sighing!

683
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:46,278
Then she comes out, looks at a calendar and says: "Oh yeah".

684
01:21:46,308 --> 01:21:48,261
Maybe waiting for when you arrive.

685
01:21:48,388 --> 01:21:53,907
In the evening it's even worse. We had three bad fish.

686
01:21:54,128 --> 01:21:56,718
~ Why?
~ Because I don't like fish!

687
01:21:56,848 --> 01:22:02,267
It's women's tactics! I can't let things go on like this.

688
01:22:02,388 --> 01:22:07,363
You said that the storm would clear. But I see you've cleared up nothing.

689
01:22:07,588 --> 01:22:13,444
Vasek, take care of Grandpa! And don't come home in less than two hours!

690
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:19,561
But, Grandpa, my dad doesn't have the key.

691
01:22:41,108 --> 01:22:44,327
A one and a two. Arabesque.

692
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:47,941
A one and a two and brace those shoulders.

693
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,820
Anna!

694
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:53,798
Anna! Anna!

695
01:22:55,768 --> 01:22:58,026
I've arrived!

696
01:23:00,728 --> 01:23:04,482
Private business after the exercise!

697
01:23:04,908 --> 01:23:07,186
I wanted to tell you...

698
01:23:07,688 --> 01:23:10,845
I'll never do anything behind your back.

699
01:23:10,968 --> 01:23:13,338
Vasek and I will always climb rocks right in front of you!

700
01:23:17,468 --> 01:23:18,742
Turn!

701
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:32,838
Mom, I'm sorry! I forced him to, every day!

702
01:23:33,268 --> 01:23:36,597
Dad didn't want to climb rocks! Not really!

703
01:23:37,828 --> 01:23:43,097
If only you knew how sorry Dad is! Really!

704
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:46,587
~ Don't start that again!
~ It's all my fault!

705
01:23:46,708 --> 01:23:51,683
Look! When you listen to a kid, you get it across the ass.

706
01:23:52,108 --> 01:23:56,382
Since you won't listen to grownups, you can't do anything.

707
01:23:56,408 --> 01:24:01,797
~ And it doesn't help your Dad or anybody else.
~ Forgive us, Mom!

708
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:07,961
I can forgive all the dirty tricks, but this is something else.

709
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:15,727
~ I don't understand you.
~ Maybe you don't want us to be happy again?

710
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:21,898
We once were three, but it can never be two again!

711
01:24:22,028 --> 01:24:27,366
Mom, Dad is here! With seven climbers. You call him!

712
01:24:27,488 --> 01:24:35,242
He's here! He wants to come home! Call him! Mommy!

713
01:24:57,808 --> 01:25:01,183
You want to go to your dad?

714
01:25:01,308 --> 01:25:06,746
~ Yeah.
~ Why don't you go? You'll have a lot of fun with him.

715
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:11,363
It would be sad for you. I know that!

716
01:25:11,488 --> 01:25:16,023
I was sad, too, when I went there myself!

717
01:25:18,828 --> 01:25:26,346
You're my little scruff. I'll tell you a secret. Do you want me to?

718
01:25:27,668 --> 01:25:32,145
What would you say if a stork flew in for us in March?

719
01:25:32,568 --> 01:25:37,421
I don't want a stork! I want my own Dad to come home.

720
01:25:37,548 --> 01:25:42,307
~ Home! Now, now!
~ I'm going to have a baby.

721
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:47,319
~ The two of us?
~ The three of us!

722
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:56,423
Here, Colombo. I arranged everything. Absolutely!

723
01:25:56,548 --> 01:26:05,466
Tomorrow at exactly nine! Three rings! Password: kangaroo will arrive in March.

724
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:15,977
~ What's this?
~ Nothing! Vasek wants to go to the zoo.

725
01:26:21,668 --> 01:26:27,601
~ Password?
~ Where's Mommy?
~ She went shopping!

726
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:30,362
Don't leave! You're here!

727
01:26:30,488 --> 01:26:38,280
~ Password? Password?
~ Kangaroo will arrive in April.
~ In March!

728
01:26:38,608 --> 01:26:43,622
~ What's with a kangaroo, what is all this?
~ Kangaroos carry kids, too.

729
01:26:43,848 --> 01:26:49,667
~ Oh, you want a brother.
~ I don't want a sister!

730
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:57,707
~ First they have to get married.
~ Grandpa, do you know how babies are born?

731
01:26:58,028 --> 01:27:03,985
~ After the wedding!
~ I kind of thought that myself.

732
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,781
But it's enough if two people love each other.

733
01:27:06,908 --> 01:27:12,578
~ That's why your mother and I have you?
~ Yeah, I followed you.

734
01:27:12,608 --> 01:27:16,957
If we're not careful, you could have a little brother!

735
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:22,145
She's not even married but she'll have two kids!

736
01:27:22,268 --> 01:27:28,923
~ You're not making sense!
~ My mom's telling the truth.
~ You're lying!

737
01:27:29,748 --> 01:27:35,224
Grandpa, how about we put our boy under the pump in a blanket?

738
01:27:35,348 --> 01:27:38,863
~ Why?
~ Let's see if he's tough!

739
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:44,543
And when there's four of us, we'll take him rock-climbing!

740
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:52,386
You're so confused. It won't be a boy, but a girl!

741
01:27:53,168 --> 01:28:00,263
Honey, don't you want me to say that we'll have two children wearing a kangaroo?

742
01:28:04,008 --> 01:28:08,081
How could the two of us have a girl?

743
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:14,583
That together we'll have a second child, we really will.

744
01:28:14,608 --> 01:28:17,759
~ Right?
~ Oh, yes!

745
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:22,558
Anna!

746
01:28:28,068 --> 01:28:31,583
Mom, Dad!

747
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:35,098
What's wrong with you?

748
01:28:35,888 --> 01:28:42,585
~ You know what? I might send them to the zoo.
~ I know you, you'll go with them.

749
01:28:43,468 --> 01:28:46,858
Anna!

750
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:51,107
Dad, Mom!
