1
00:00:56,171 --> 00:01:03,931
Sun, hay and erotica

2
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:28,571
I'm sweating like the barn door.
That's a disgrace!

3
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:34,527
I've a good mind to pack it in!
-She's right. Undress it.

4
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,449
Take off the sweater.

5
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,576
Where are you looking again?

6
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:41,568
Don't make a mess.

7
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,855
Shame on her! She just wants to
make men to look at her.

8
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:50,372
And she even stands up!
Shame on you!

9
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:52,536
Nothing to be ashamed for.

10
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,289
She wants to seduce our men!

11
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:00,650
Like it's worthy.
Father, close your eyes.

12
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:04,093
Say something to her.
-Why are you staring at me?

13
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,812
Look forward and won't get sick.

14
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:11,612
It's so blatant.
See that, Father?

15
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:15,366
I don't see. I better not to. 

16
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,650
Where are you going, Father?
You don't have to, you are ours.

17
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:30,605
They said all men, Kelišová.

18
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:32,369
Yeah.

19
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:40,213
Don't undress, shame on you!

20
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,051
Father, don't you dare!

21
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:54,005
-What can I do?

22
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,214

23
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:28,009
They could do, right?
-Gee

24
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:30,531
The one with glasses looks good.

25
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,846
I fancy the driver.

26
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,776
Hi.

27
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:57,205
I have my backpack there.
-Hubby, here I am.

28
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,732
Pepa! Where is Pepa?
-Went to hotel for keys.

29
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,046
I wanna room with balcony.
-You bet.

30
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:07,368
I wanna view to the sea.
-Anyone could say that.

31
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:11,211
Jesus, it's so nice here!
Like in Krumlov.

32
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:15,729
Father...
-What about Josef. -Sure.

33
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:18,973
Me with Josef? No, never.

34
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,534
To be in one room with that infidel?
Never!

35
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:27,092
I protest!
-You're right, Father.

36
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:32,205
With such amoral scum!
I bet he snores.

37
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:36,774
So you sleep with him, Kelišová.
Only two more rooms and you are three.

38
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:39,888
For chrissake,
are you nuts?

39
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:44,527
With that filthy pig?
I'd rather sleep under tree!

40
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,648
Did you hear that, Father?
-What?

41
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:51,575
Don't yell here, you aren't
in village anymore.

42
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:56,488
The only possibility is with Kelišová then.

43
00:06:56,736 --> 00:07:00,126
Holy Mary,can you hear?

44
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,134
How can man of purity

45
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,890
share a bed with woman?

46
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:09,054
Play heads or tails, but quickly.

47
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:14,046
What will they think of us?
Czechs and can't settle.

48
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,729
Let's go...

49
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:19,605
God, where did you sent me this time?

50
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:25,971
Father, I'll roll myself to the wall
so I won't tempt you. 

51
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:32,326
I ordered new swimmsuit, yellow one..

52
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,687
Jesus Christ!
It moves!

53
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,729
Yuck, that's some sea creature!

54
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:41,535
Take it away!
-Hubby, don't touch that!

55
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,495
Jesus, what's that?
-It blinked!

56
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,370
And the potatoes move as well.
-Oh yeah.

57
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:52,685
Stop screaming, women!
We aren't oafs.

58
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:57,056
You wanted some Italian specials
so here you are. 

59
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,890
I wonder who'll eat it now.
Who? All of us.

60
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,007
We aren't yokels.

61
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,774
Or are we?

62
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,448
That's awful.

63
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,405
Tomatoes, I know that.

64
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,886
And this is seaweed.

65
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,336
Look, look!

66
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,606
Chrissake, here!

67
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:28,892
Take this, you ugly bastard!

68
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:33,086
That's disgrace, Father.
Where we ended up?

69
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,616
See?

70
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,772
Can't, I'm full.

71
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:50,649
I've a good mind to pack it in! Thank God
we have supplies from home.

72
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:57,090
Otherwise we'd starved to death.
-Kelišová, where are you going?

73
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,893
With God's help.

74
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,853
Pepo, don't you dare!

75
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,889
If you take it to your mouth,
I won't kiss you anymore.

76
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:14,695
Representation my leg.
Much ado for nothing.

77
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,246
Jesus, she's a pig.

78
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,774
<i>Scusi, signore.

79
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,364
Father, gonna throw up.

80
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:20,214
<i>E, ciao, signorine!

81
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,781
Man, it's them.

82
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,250
Mafia, I bet.
-Don't say.

83
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,253
We know each other already, right?

84
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:30,289
How could they find us?

85
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:32,965
Let's leave, quickly.

86
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,248
Where to, cuties?

87
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,209
We are tourists.

88
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,615
Miluna!

89
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,016
No!

90
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,933
Come...

91
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:49,728
Bernardo, hit it!

92
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,896
<i>Pericoloso!

93
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:09,924
To walk alone in the foreign town
isn't very wise. 

94
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:13,009
You need la protezione.
-Si. -Protection.

95
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:15,732
And that's us!

96
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:21,207
Bene, good! And now, ladies,
we invite you to drink, si?

97
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,372
That's not proper, we don't know 
each other yet.

98
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,446
<i>Mi scuso, signorine!

99
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:33,096
<i>Io sono Bernardo. 
-Vincenzo.

100
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:36,295
I'm Evièka,
You can call me Evík.

101
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:40,894
Evík! Miluna!
-Evík, Miluna...

102
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,736
<i>Ciao!

103
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,968
<i>Ciao, Bernardo!
-Ciao...

104
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,656
Vincenzo!

105
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:59,214
Amici, what can I do for you?
-Come sempre, like the usual.

106
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:06,013
Do it really well today.
-Si, si, everything's gonna be ok.

107
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,576
Filippo!

108
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,696
Don't say.

109
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:17,246
Jaroušek would be envious.
-Jaroušek, and eveyone.

110
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,896
<i>Che cosa?

111
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:22,531
<i>Perfetto.
-Perfetto! Filippo, presto!

112
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,775
<i>Cin cin!
-Cin cin...

113
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,128
You wanna run away?

114
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,455
Yeah.

115
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,651
They just ordered us dinner.

116
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,405
What if they slip some drugs in it?

117
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:59,289
Drugs?
-They'll put into sleep, kidnap you...

118
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:00,896
I don't know.

119
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,009
Don't say!

120
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:06,968
You can't tell what mafia do.

121
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:08,855
They asked you?

122
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,733
Bullshit!
-What did you tell them?

123
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:14,416
That you are indeed the local mafia bosses.

124
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,974
You cretin!

125
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:19,606
So I should tell them you work as 
servicemen here at the farm?

126
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,245
Think.
They'll let you do things

127
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,128
and then you'll thank me.

128
00:13:24,856 --> 00:13:29,452
They can think anything,
the truth is we can use it.

129
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,092
Ok, but I'm capo.

130
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:34,496
OK.

131
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,608
The truth is we can use it..

132
00:13:42,336 --> 00:13:43,736
Yeah!

133
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,769
Blažena, Gábina.

134
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:48,136
That's it.

135
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:51,254
But can we talk them into?

136
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,533
Don't worry.
Are they into us? They are.

137
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,089
Are we cute girls?
We are. That's it.

138
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:01,576
Miluna!

139
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,729
You are beautiful. I think I love you.

140
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:34,527
You bet.
-I swear on my soul.

141
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,781
If you really love me you could do 
something for me.

142
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:43,492
Anything.
-You don't have to, I'm modest.

143
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,415
Like Lenin. I can do with little.

144
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:50,012
I hate one woman.

145
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:54,214
You don't know her, she's
such a bitch.

146
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:56,576
She destroyed my life.

147
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,250
<i>Non piangere, non piangere!

148
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>Cara Eviku.</i>
-Mila, say something.

149
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,689
Damn, me too. The other one.
-Other one?

150
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,766
There are two, due puttane.

151
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,015
<i>Due!

152
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,574
Both are terrible.

153
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:16,336
So if they kidnap them, likvidate them...

154
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,006
You'll do a good deed.
-Kidnap?

155
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:22,936
<i>Come?

156
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,096
Nevermind. We'll find others if you are afraid.

157
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:28,496
Evik, let's go.

158
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,569
Who's afraid?

159
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,852
Say it again!

160
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:37,926
I'll offer you all of my Slavic charm

161
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:41,373
if you kidnap those two bitches.

162
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:45,856
<i>Signori!

163
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,136
One moment.

164
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:50,287
Not now, only after! Let's go.

165
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:55,095
You made fine mess, cretin!

166
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:57,526
Thank you very much.

167
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:08,655
Ugly violet thing!
-Brr!

168
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,928
I still see that.

169
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:14,328
Thank God we don't have sea.

170
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:18,813
Gimme.
-Open your own.

171
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:21,652
All I want is a sip!

172
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:26,566
Don't think you'll finish it by yourself.
There is still the tomorrow.

173
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,616
What?

174
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,131
I'm looking for sheets.

175
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,889
Under the bed?

176
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:42,288
Italians have to cover themselves somehow.
But there's nothing.

177
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,494
So what, it's hot.
-I'm gonna ask.

178
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:51,292
Where are you going? -Máòa, so you can't
find anything to cover yourself, too?

179
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,288
I looked everywhere.

180
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,574
This hotel is weird.

181
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:00,491
I bet we'll have to sleep dressed.
-Thank God we brought the sweaters.

182
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,448
Halo, halo!

183
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:04,495
Halo?

184
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,732
How do you say halo in Italian?

185
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,330
Hello!
<i>- Si, signora.</i>

186
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:17,493
Eh, uh... Come here!

187
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,844
Our room here... 

188
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:23,461
But there is...

189
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:26,090
<i>Buonasera, signore.</i> -Here.

190
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,854
No sheet.

191
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:29,973
<i>Si, capisco. 

192
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:34,374
But your bed is ready.
-Show me, then.

193
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:37,369
<i>Permesso.

194
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:39,808
Like that, madame.

195
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:43,885
So I have to suck in
or we together?

196
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,291
Momento, madame, I'll show.

197
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,454
What, what...

198
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:01,850
What's going on?
You'd like that, right?

199
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,650
Did you wanna see how to get inside,
so she shows. 

200
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,091
This isn't hotel but bordello!

201
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,175
It was, madame, but sadly
they closed it down.

202
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,647
That's a lot of water...
-Don't stare and eat.

203
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,776
Leave me alone.

204
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:42,934
Are you nuts, people?
Why you eat so much?

205
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:46,255
We are invited to dinner.

206
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,174
That will be something.

207
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:52,847
Like yesterday. Monsters pulled from the sea.

208
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,848
Oh please.
-You're right!

209
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:59,055
Eat what you can, we have
all morning for that.

210
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:05,133
Don't go anywhere, Father.
You know you can't fight.

211
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:08,408
Don't start again, Kelišová.
-Right!

212
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:12,165
They show it all the time on tv,
they fight here. 

213
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:16,295
That's Iraq and Iran, we are in Italy.

214
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:19,410
No matter, it starts on "I", too.

215
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,730
Aunt, you won't go to water?

216
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:29,208
To catch some AIDS? Now, when I'm old?

217
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,176
Blažena!

218
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:42,288
Don't swimm too deep.

219
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:43,936
Don't you dare!

220
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,087
The edge is enough.

221
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:19,615
God, have mercy and avert the temptation 
from your servant.

222
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:32,935
This is supposed to be stables?
Chairman, that can't be!

223
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,085
<i>Buongiorno, cari amici!

224
00:20:37,056 --> 00:20:40,776
Don't be oafs.
And when you do wonder,

225
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:42,732
shut your mouth, Kelišová!

226
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:45,609
Benvenuti, welcome!

227
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:49,176
Don't say!

228
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:53,216
They can go everywhere.
True Mafia.

229
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,421
I'm presidento.
-Nice to meet you. Rádl Josef.

230
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,971
It's like at home.
-Stop undermine everything!

231
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,729
Let me there too.

232
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,489
Wait, I was here first.

233
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,573
Moment, brothers.

234
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,732
<i>Si, benvenuto, padre.

235
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,176
That's enough...

236
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,135
Presidento!

237
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,688
All the world talks about you.
-No! -Si!

238
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:24,967
It's pleasure to say

239
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:29,971
that thanks to your experiment
"The Plánièka System"

240
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:33,731
our farm is the most famous
in the whole Italy.

241
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,332
Bravo!
-The whole Italy.

242
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,568
Vincenzo!

243
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,051
This is our chief engineer Vincenzo.
He's the best.

244
00:21:43,256 --> 00:21:48,125
Can repair TV screen, fridge...
He was twice on TV.

245
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,014
<i>Buongiorno!

246
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:53,169
Make yourself presentable and then come upstairs.

247
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:55,890
You'll dine with us. <i>- Si, presidente, si.</i>

248
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,936
Bernardo!

249
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:13,013
This is our animal specialist, Bernardo.

250
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:16,333
He'll show you the department of
milk production.

251
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,496
<i>Ciao!

252
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,215
Hi.

253
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,888
Prego, this way!

254
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:26,571
The cleansiness is everything for us.
-Yeah, Yeah.

255
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,928
That's why we produce the highest
quality milk. Here!

256
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:35,727
That's wonderful.
Cecilka would be surprised.

257
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:39,566
So you wash the cows every day?

258
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,248
Twice a day.

259
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:45,245
And we twice a year.

260
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:47,175
Nagger!

261
00:22:47,376 --> 00:22:51,415
Plánièka's method.
We just widen it slightly.

262
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:54,049
Slightly, hm.

263
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,132
Can't eat anymore, hun.

264
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,244
Unfasten your belt, then.
We can't leave it here.

265
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,846
Right, it'd be waste.

266
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:21,015
Too bad we ate all the home-made
schnitzels. -Shut up.

267
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:25,004
The Czech farmer won't retreat from 
the dining table.

268
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:31,930
Hm, thou shall not steal, Kelišová.

269
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:36,445
Shit, Father.
What if someone else steals it?

270
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:39,091
We'll have evening meal.

271
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:42,936
Wine?

272
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,496
So?

273
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:53,376
<i>Aspetto.

274
00:23:54,576 --> 00:23:56,009
<i>Si, si.

275
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:58,053
<i>Uno momento, cara.

276
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:01,496
Bernardo!

277
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,894
<i>Antonio, presto! </i>
-Move it.

278
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:09,212
Do you have money?

279
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:13,012
Brothers said they won't do a thing.
No money, no job.

280
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:15,252
<i>Chiaro?
-La merda! 

281
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:19,246
Here's the advance, the rest after
we got salary.

282
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:22,613
We are broke.
-And when will you show them to me?

283
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,087
Come upstairs in a bit.

284
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,810
Those I'll pour wine for.

285
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,656
And just for sure,
I'll do this.

286
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,456
Clear?

287
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,369
Wine?

288
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,813
Hubby, you got off your shoes.

289
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:17,576
Only a bit.

290
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,213
On my soul, he did. 

291
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:23,892
Such a stench!
Get it on now!

292
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,696
Hun!

293
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,048
I can't find it.

294
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,128
Get under the table and find his shoe
before everyone dies of stench.

295
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:42,171
Why me again?
-Shut up and get under.

296
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,732
Well, how to put it.

297
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:49,725
I put this hair style first time
on my head thanks to bed

298
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:52,206
and this is looks it how.
 
299
00:25:57,496 --> 00:26:00,329
Oh, mom.
-In the farm's intention...

300
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,971
La salute, cheers!

301
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,696
It's done.

302
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:08,333
We'll see.

303
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:14,651
Friends, amici, to the success of our
future project

304
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:19,245
and to your brave Slavic women.

305
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,808
Hear, hear!

306
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:25,366
Vivat!

307
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:33,974
This isn't sleep!

308
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:37,090
It's disgusting, I'm all flat.

309
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:40,972
No wonder the Italian women are
so thin. 

310
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,374
I'm out of blanket.

311
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:49,529
Where are you going?
-Leave me alone.

312
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,565
Well, the last one.

313
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:57,773
I wish we are back home.
Here, drink.

314
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:02,765
Hubby, I miss your snoring.

315
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:07,690
Those cicades yells like cows.
-You have always problems.

316
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,055
How can you even live
in this world?

317
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,969
Sleeping with you is terrible.


318
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:21,249
Praise the Lord we return tomorrow.
-And I didn't do any shopping.

319
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:02,684
Jaruško, I see them there.

320
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:09,171
I don't know the size.

321
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:11,336
Size.

322
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:13,653
<i>Come la signora?

323
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:17,969
<i>Cosí, cosí, cosí?</i>
-Oh, boobs.

324
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:21,212
Like this.
-Father!

325
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:22,856
Father!

326
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:27,527
Heaven sends me you!
I'm trying to find sweater for Cecilka

327
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,930
but I don't know the size and 
Keliška is missing. 

328
00:28:33,256 --> 00:28:35,372
Don't you have something

329
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:38,613
for the average person,
like me?

330
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:42,695
Signora, I've got something better!

331
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:47,213
Come.

332
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,690
Thank you, then. Grazie.

333
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,527
Father, come with us, he has
some goods.

334
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,892
Imported stuff, but cheap...

335
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:03,453
No, Father, ladies only.
-But yeah, Father is ours.

336
00:29:03,856 --> 00:29:06,176
Our friend.
<i>- Amico, si. </i>

337
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,248
We wanna have some man with us.
-Let's go!

338
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,295
<i>Presto, presto! </i>
-Don't worry, we are quick.

339
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:17,524
Here, ladies.
Thank God!

340
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:21,616
That's what I'm looking for.
-See what happens when you help.

341
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:25,291
We bring him with and he takes the best...

342
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:37,408
Hello, where are you?

343
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,016
Where are cloths?
-There.

344
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:46,009
You git!

345
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:56,012
Giuseppe, Giuseppe!

346
00:29:56,216 --> 00:30:00,528 
So that's your sweaters!
You bastard!
 
347
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,647
Giuseppe, Giuseppe!

348
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,376
Help!

349
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,288
Vincenzo!

350
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,815
Give it to me!

351
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:10,286
Unfortunately, your friends won't
show up in the bus. 

352
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:13,290
What are we waiting for?
-Wait!

353
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:17,245
So both of them are...
-I hope not.

354
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,530
But I bet they're in unpleasant situation.

355 :24,456
Miluna!

356
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:39,728
Ce... cí... lie... je... je...

357
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:42,694
Silence!

358
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:44,576
Zip!

359
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:50,845
Damn bastards, one can't leave
home 

360
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,971
or they kidnap someone.

361
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:56,934
Evik!

362
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:19,135
Look!

363
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:27,974
Miluna!

364
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,249
You!

365
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,896
Rude pigs.

366
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:41,407
That's for the sweaters.

367
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:44,488
Father, slap him, too.

368
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:49,372
Let his teeth fall off for what he dared!

369
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:53,685
It was the other one.

370
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:57,649
Giuseppe!

371
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,928
Come here!

372
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:04,971
I'll show you, bastard!

373
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,855
Kneel!

374
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:11,448
Beg for mercy and turn the other cheek!
Well, Padre?

375
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,896
So?

376
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:25,848
Where's that pink sweater?

377
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,765
They're cretins.
Miluna, Evik, so...

378
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,372
They're cretins! This could never happen
to us!

379
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:40,527
I swear, we love you.

380
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:42,169
Miluna, Evik.

381
00:33:44,896 --> 00:33:48,366
That's your fault, idiot!
-Don't push me!

382
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:53,286
It was well-thought..
-The shit it was.

383
00:33:53,576 --> 00:33:55,009
Look at them!

384
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:10,285
Ahhh!
Miluna!

385
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:23,254
<i>My dear...

386
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:28,568
<i>My dear, where are you...

387
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:35,008
<i>My dear...

388
00:34:36,656 --> 00:34:38,374
<i>Where are you...

389
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:41,164
Bravo!

390
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:47,650
Padre, eat whatever you want.

391
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,526
Too bad you can't be here at sunday.

392
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,409
So this is the unpleasant situation?

393
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:59,365
Hello, girls!
How come you are here?

394
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:03,410
Imagine, they kidnapped us!
By mistake.

395
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:07,529
But they're very nice people.

396
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:11,093
They killed chickens, cooked them...

397
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:14,374
gave us watermelons...

398
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,688
They even lifted me!

399
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:22,848
They're gits, but I already
slapped them.

400
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:29,130
But they promised never do that again.
Right, youths?

401
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,685
Can't you reply?

402
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:35,014
Madonna mia, you are too kind to them.

403
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,935
Thank goodness.

404
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:43,086
I'm just old, weak woman who can't
handle them alone.

405
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:46,691
Don't stare! Bring the salad.

406
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:50,571
At least you're okay!
They hit my head with shoe!.

407
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:54,212
Girls!
-That's beautiful! -My size!

408
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:58,250
Where did you get it?
-You have to know places.

409
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,174
And bargain!

410
00:36:01,936 --> 00:36:04,689
Thank you for the visit,
cari amici.

411
00:36:04,936 --> 00:36:07,814
I believe we'll see each other
more often.

412
00:36:08,056 --> 00:36:10,365
We thank you too and believe

413
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,341
That we can welcome you soon in Hoštice.

414
00:36:13,376 --> 00:36:18,245
Si, si, we gladly accept.
Is it okay at the end of the month?

415
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:22,251
Which one?
-This one.

416
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:24,885
Say... 28th, Saturday.

417
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,771
Can't do sooner.

418
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:31,246
Evik!
-Miluna, don't be angry at me.

419
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:35,608
Not my fault I'm not with mafia.
-But you are doublecrosser. Bye.

420
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:37,856
Czech boys are best.
-Miluna!

421
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:40,324
You can't leave me like that.

422
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:45,653
Per favore,
where can we find Padre Otík?

423
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,535
What?

424
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:51,449
Father, some monks are looking for you.

425
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,530
What are you asking me for, dear brothers?

426
00:36:56,296 --> 00:37:00,653
Father Superior gives his greetings
and sends you little present.

427
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:04,725
To support the Church in Bohemia, Moravia,
Silesia..

428
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:07,929
And Slovakia, too.
-Too...

429
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:10,605
Computer.
-PC.

430
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:17,768
Computer... Thousand thanks to 
Father Superior

431
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:21,926
I'll send letter of thanks.

432
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:26,168
No, I'll do it myself.

433
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,966
What will you do with that, Father?

434
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,372
You'll be very surprised.

435
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:49,809
I think I love him nevertheless.
-Me too.

436
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,447
So much.

437
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:16,767
Such a mess.

438
00:38:27,816 --> 00:38:32,287
Strange... Can you see what you didn't 
see before? 

439
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,170
Or rather didn't want to see.
-Stop it, Josef

440
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,421
You are in our comitee as a people's opinion.

441
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:41,165
True, it's democracy now, but you
won't undermine everything.

442
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:48,575
Eeek!

443
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,046
Don't worry, mom,
it's just a comitee.

444
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,526
Chrissake!

445
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,288
Comrades aren't here for you, mom.

446
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:02,130
We aren't comrades anymore, gran.

447
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,129
We know each other!
-You!

448
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:09,374
I told you many times not to give her
my son's toys!

449
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,208
Do I give it to her?

450
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:17,935
You lost a soldier here.

451
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:20,649
Evík, write.

452
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:23,650
Clean the yard,

453
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,930
cover the dung...

454
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:30,891
and all the stuff is in disorder.

455
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,855
Disorder, you say?
We are building here!

456
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:35,814
Stuff in disorder
-Disorder...

457
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:37,608
There isn't Y in disorder!

458
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:39,329
We are building!

459
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:43,893
And do something with all this
chickenshit.

460
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:47,048
And you have carpets on your right, eh?

461
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:48,776
Carpets!

462
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:52,332
It's about presentation.
What'll those Italians think about us?

463
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:55,687
That we live here in shit!
-Hubby!

464
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,927
Don't write this!

465
00:39:58,456 --> 00:40:00,333
She erased "live".

466
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:02,487
Cretin.

467
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:08,526
We have to improve this as well.
But how?

468
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:12,301
That's easy.
-Another of your ideas?

469
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:16,124
We'll put hose with a brush...

470
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:18,571
and we'll have the washing machine
like they have.

471
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,821
We have mud spa everythime it rains...

472
00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:23,973
And then those small Dior sprays...
 
473
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:28,576
Stop the bullshit and build us a toilet, finally!

474
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:30,612
Women, what do you say?
-Right.

475
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:34,646
Toilet. Fourty years you gone 
behind the barn

476
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:38,645
and now you want better.
You can't be allowed abroad.

477
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:42,015
Comrades, please... Girls!

478
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,088
That's why we are here.

479
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:47,851
We have to improve all this
in no time. 

480
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:52,049
Otherwise the Italians won't 
join our business.

481
00:40:52,256 --> 00:40:55,566
Konopníková, we were at your yard.

482
00:40:55,776 --> 00:41:00,691
It's not nice. -Chairman,
I didn't invite any Italians.

483
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,129
They arrive and I'll hide and that's it.

484
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:17,173
It seems that in our village
only church and graveyard are ok.

485
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:20,816
Mostly the graveyard.
-So we'll show them mostly this.

486
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:22,861
Josef...
-Let him,

487
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:26,366
We already took his benefits.

488
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:29,050
Don't piss me, Josef.

489
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,574
We all know where we went with communism.

490
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:33,813
But how can we get out of this?

491
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:38,451
<i>Hallo, hallo.

492
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:43,892
<i>Town hall and the comitee invite 
all citizens to the extraordinary

493
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:49,733
<i>meeting to the pub today at six PM.

494
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:53,806
<i>Arrive at time.</i>
-Do you hear that, Father?

495
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:57,376
<i>Free beer is served during the main topic.

496
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,861
A public meeting
<i>- Repeat...</i>

497
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:04,021
Exceptionaly extraordinary
or extraordinary exceptionaly.

498
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:09,813
I don't know, but it's in the pub.
-We don't need meetings anymore.

499
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:15,126
We have everything in order.

500
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:19,455
Well, not me. I still have to
clean the sacristy

501
00:42:20,376 --> 00:42:22,492
whiten the stables.

502
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:25,006
They'll visit it anyway.

503
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:29,534
And where would be this method
without or Dolly.

504
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:33,016
You are right, Cecilie.

505
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:39,729
Father, I'd go there anyway.
Good to know what's happening. 

506
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,131
Milunka, Milunka!

507
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:48,534
Give us one.
Or rather two.

508
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:54,011
Just a sec, aunt, I'll be with you right away.
-She does it on purpose.

509
00:42:56,936 --> 00:43:00,815
Friens, in conclusion,
I say it again.

510
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:05,809
Every idea, every thought 

511
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:10,766
how to improve things here
is welcomed.

512
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:15,485
With this I end the topic and open
the discussion.

513
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:17,489
Here...

514
00:43:22,216 --> 00:43:25,781
Wait, what does it mean?
-You heard, end of topic

515
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:29,096
now you pay it by youselves.
-And when did I order!

516
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:32,416
They won't notice elderly
even if she died of thirst.

517
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:34,646
Right, Cecilka, so the world repays.

518
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,888
Speak, people!

519
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:43,893
Usually you have mouth full of talk
and now your lips are sealed.

520
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,646
Frankly.

521
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:51,770
If we want to prevent bankrupcy

522
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:55,526
we can't do without Italians.

523
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:58,968
I have suggestion.

524
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,531
So...

525
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:05,294
Get them drunk right away

526
00:44:05,536 --> 00:44:07,128
and they'll sign whatever we want.

527
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:11,175
Write it down, Evik,
there is something into it.

528
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:13,088
Get Italians drunk.

529
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,455
We have to do it anyway.

530
00:44:18,136 --> 00:44:21,253
Well, I... Me and Gabby think,

531
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:26,213
that we need to show Italians something...

532
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:30,967
that will show them we can be worldly. 
Right, Gabby?

533
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:32,615
I think, I think...

534
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:37,895
Let Jaruš and Wendy sing in national dresses...
And I have got bagpipes.

535
00:44:38,616 --> 00:44:40,174
Bagpipes, today!

536
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:42,967
We have to shock them!

537
00:44:43,656 --> 00:44:47,365
Bagpipes, please.
-Me and Gabby think...

538
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:50,045
that we should found...

539
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:55,655
how to say it politely?
-Don't know.

540
00:44:55,856 --> 00:44:59,132
Well...
-Nudist beach.

541
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:05,056
What's that?
-Sodom and Gomorrah, Patoèková.

542
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:08,253
Phew, no!
-We won't approve.

543
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:12,729
Say something, Father.
-Going commando, that's healthy.

544
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:15,405
Right, doctor?
-True.

545
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,808
Don't start.
-You'd like that!

546
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:23,248
Ogle nude women. -Like we haven't
ever seen one.

547
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:25,134
My words.
-Shut up!

548
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:28,576
Shame on you, men, don't you have
enough at home?

549
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:30,851
Isn't that right, women?

550
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:35,216
I think it would be classy.

551
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:39,607
Classy, my leg!
Go there and I'll broke yours!

552
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,416
We want into Europe. Even naked. 

553
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,976
I'm for that.
-Hubby!

554
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:50,409
But we won't go too far with 
the nudity.

555
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:56,965
E.g. women could be nude only
from here to there.

556
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:03,013
And men from sack below.
Nice work, chairman.

557
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:07,972
That will shock the Italians
for good.

558
00:46:14,096 --> 00:46:18,533
Holy Virgin, what they 
came up with again!

559
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:22,927
It's not enough for them to be...
where they are.

560
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:26,092
End of the world.

561
00:46:27,216 --> 00:46:29,969
I'm still off balance.

562
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:34,968
What can we do?
-The best defense is attack, Cecílie.

563
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:37,969
Call in the sisters... and we'll see.

564
00:46:38,536 --> 00:46:39,936
At night?

565
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,610
The martyrs brought sacrifices, too.

566
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:46,331
They didn't mind the day- or nighttime.

567
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:03,085
I have to catch my breath.

568
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:07,647
I bet they murdered someone.

569
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:10,171
Girls, who wants grog?

570
00:47:12,216 --> 00:47:16,494
Shame!
-True.

571
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:22,529
We are ready, Father.

572
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:25,254
See?

573
00:47:26,456 --> 00:47:32,372
We can't step into Europe with 
such material.

574
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:37,331
I'd sell hot dogs in the shack.

575
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,654
Some boutics around.

576
00:47:41,576 --> 00:47:46,491
And the hedge from bonsai trees around.

577
00:47:47,336 --> 00:47:48,894
What are you doing?

578
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:53,129
Practicing for Olympics, moron.
-Just wait!

579
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:58,450
Don't you think you'll walk the beach like this.

580
00:47:58,856 --> 00:48:00,847
Disgusting egotist!

581
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:05,606
And you want to be in charge of international
business?

582
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:09,571
And this nudist beach was your idea anyway.

583
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:14,094
Who else should set the example 
but your wife?

584
00:48:14,336 --> 00:48:16,461
Yeah. But you heard the chairman.

585
00:48:16,496 --> 00:48:20,455
Naked woman from here to there.
-You moralist.

586
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:22,336
What are you doing?

587
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:28,405
I'm doing something...
Now I can't see.

588
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:33,735
Are you crazy?
I hit my head, you idiot!

589
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:37,821
Am I some kind of mattress?
-What an moron of a man I've got!

590
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:41,096
I can't live with you since you've
seen  <i>Emmanuelle</i>.

591
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:45,533
It's you who call for Emmanuelle.
-Bullshit.

592
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:33,816
My god...

593
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:36,894
Where did you get it, chairman?

594
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:40,446
We had a discussion at home...

595
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:44,405
Beat it.
But in the end I persuaded her.

596
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:48,285
This is architect Svinutý.

597
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:51,972
Pilátová Eva, Pleased to meet you. Secretary.

598
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:54,292
Svinutý.
-Béd'a.

599
00:49:54,776 --> 00:49:56,176
Svinutý.

600
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:01,976
This is the object?
-Yeah, that's it.

601
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:04,126
Half of the 17th century.

602
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:12,090
Are you stupid?

603
00:50:12,336 --> 00:50:15,453
You'll make it nice for us,
right. Mr. Architect?

604
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:25,209
And when it should be done?
-Until 28th.

605
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:29,209
28th of what?
-This month.

606
00:50:29,856 --> 00:50:33,815
Dam sings, river does magic,
moon above the river...

607
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,012
And the mornings are quiet.

608
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,054
Mr. Architect!

609
00:50:38,296 --> 00:50:43,928
Mr. Architecht, don't trust him
and don't go inside!

610
00:50:44,256 --> 00:50:48,169
Kelišová, you thwart the 
official act.

611
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:52,695
We could make it very unpleasant for you.
I'd give a shit.

612
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:55,086
Incarcerate me!

613
00:50:55,936 --> 00:51:00,248
I had to warn him, that's my christian duty.

614
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:01,856
From what?

615
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:05,611
If I may inquire.
-They didn't tell you?

616
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:07,216
The mill is haunted.

617
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:10,176
Our department of construction is
accustomed to horrors.

618
00:51:10,211 --> 00:51:13,532
Let it go
-she? When she dies.

619
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:21,415
She's nightmare, the hag!

620
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,930
So much work here.

621
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:29,768
28th you say?
-Few small rooms would be enough.

622
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:33,088
For dressing, showers, too...

623
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:35,287
My first guess is...

624
00:51:35,496 --> 00:51:37,885
Around one and half million.

625
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:40,894
Million?
-Yeah. -Chrissake!

626
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,733
Such a sum.
Where could they get it?

627
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:48,332
Kelišová, dammit!

628
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:54,448
We can spare around 35 thousands,
right, Chairman?

629
00:51:56,976 --> 00:52:00,696
In that case, don't do any reconstruction.

630
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:03,529
Pay the amateur actors to paint the scenery.

631
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:07,251
35 000 would be enough for that.

632
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:11,096
Told you.

633
00:52:11,136 --> 00:52:13,092
What an idea!

634
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:17,972
Good day, aunt.
-G'day.

635
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:22,614
What did you bring me, Vašík?
-Lime, aunt. From the co-op.

636
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:25,332
You ought to whiten your house.

637
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:30,571
All of it? With this brush?

638
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:34,610
They said at least the front side.
-And who's gonna do that?

639
00:52:34,816 --> 00:52:38,126
Likely you, aunt.
-Me, an old woman?

640
00:52:38,336 --> 00:52:43,615
Should I climb up? I can't even
stay on the ladder.

641
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:45,654
Don't know, aunt.

642
00:52:45,936 --> 00:52:48,370
Bye.
-Lazy git.

643
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:55,449
Crissake! I miss the Communist.
They never wanted one to do things.

644
00:52:57,016 --> 00:53:01,771
And even if the house crashed on my head,
they wouldn't notice me at all.

645
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:06,689
In Italy, they have open marked in
every village. Here's nothing.

646
00:53:06,936 --> 00:53:08,892
Good day.
-Good day.

647
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:15,892
Open market. Whe used to have
great fairs.

648
00:53:16,256 --> 00:53:19,054
Ládík, say something.
-Don't tell me.

649
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,375
I don't know why we abolished them.

650
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:26,615
Pretzels, are you out of your mind?
-You used to have bakery, right?

651
00:53:26,816 --> 00:53:30,729
Yeah, but you took it from us in 1948.
-Us?

652
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:32,569
It was Communists.

653
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:37,616
Comrade secretary, don't tell me.
And the oven is ruined anyway.

654
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:41,211
No matter, Aunt. Old Vacík
should build you a new one.

655
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:45,528
He's lucky to even breathe.
And leave me alone.

656
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:49,172
No discussion, Krajánková!

657
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:54,611
You'll bake such pretzels that 
Italians won't ever forget.

658
00:53:55,136 --> 00:54:00,085
Hurry, aunt, hurry!
They'll come as soon as 28th.

659
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:04,773
Let's go, it's no use.
-And think it of as political mission!

660
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,534
Goodbye.

661
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,729
And I'd denounce it, Father.

662
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:16,290
To whom?
-To the Italians.

663
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:20,212
People here are no good.

664
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:24,371
I'm no denouncer, but it must be told.

665
00:54:24,576 --> 00:54:26,612
Right you are, Maøenka.

666
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:32,528
You forget about Josef, Father.

667
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:35,614
That git was there, too.

668
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:39,452
You're right, Cecilka.

669
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:43,204
J-o-s-e-f.

670
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:46,925
And we have them all.

671
00:54:48,696 --> 00:54:52,575
They invited the architect from
Budìjovice.

672
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,895
But he'd a good mind to pack it in.

673
00:54:56,136 --> 00:55:00,209
I told him the mill is haunted.

674
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:06,650
Well, that huge black dog and
the dead sexton.

675
00:55:06,976 --> 00:55:08,376
Cecilka!

676
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:09,976
Cecilka!

677
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:13,850
I've got letter for you
-Thanks -Bye.

678
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:15,496
She writes again.

679
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:19,805
Maria, Maria!

680
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:26,009
And what's she writing about, Father?

681
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:30,890
Nothing important.
About the procession etc.

682
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:35,011
And she greets you.
-Thanks. -You're welcome.

683
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:38,606
Cutie, I suppose?
-Well, cutie...

684
00:55:38,856 --> 00:55:42,644
... rather short one and wild. 
-Wild one?

685
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:48,051
And ugly as hell.

686
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:50,536
Ugly?

687
00:55:51,176 --> 00:55:52,814
Really?

688
00:55:53,056 --> 00:55:56,969
The Lord gave so much beauty to everyone
as he saw fit, Kelišová.

689
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,689
Big black dog, you say?

690
00:56:09,896 --> 00:56:12,012
Technology marches on, Chairman.

691
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:17,126
Moves alone, walks alone, see?
Better than some computing stuff.

692
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:21,005
Leave it be, Josef.
You already have one PC.

693
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:26,694
Calculator more likely.
They have PC!

694
00:56:27,056 --> 00:56:30,685
They have... You are like the
women from the barn.

695
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:35,766
Chairman, they've got swimming pools.
Chairman, the've got toilet.

696
00:56:36,176 --> 00:56:40,169
Where can get money for it 
when the farm is bankrupted!

697
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:43,129
And you demand computer.

698
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:47,654
Ask the priest to lend it to you.
You are in commitee now

699
00:56:47,856 --> 00:56:50,893
so do your best.
-Wish I could see that. 

700
00:56:51,136 --> 00:56:53,730
To him.

701
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:58,767
Grow up!

702
00:56:59,216 --> 00:57:03,004
I wonder why he needs PC.
A priest.

703
00:57:03,536 --> 00:57:07,609
The thing is to get money from
Italians.

704
00:57:07,856 --> 00:57:11,016
Or even ten PCs won't help us.
-Stop him poking.

705
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:13,769
Better send the lazyass to the mill
paintig the scenery.

706
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,012
Leave me alone.
-Lád'a...

707
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,053
Evik, I've got something for you.

708
00:57:19,496 --> 00:57:20,896
Thanks.

709
00:57:21,736 --> 00:57:23,328
Can't...

710
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:27,529
Can't be... Bernarndo mio!

711
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:37,168
He wants to marry me but first
he has to talk with his mom.

712
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,965
Bought two rings and the honeymoon 
should be in Nigeria.

713
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:43,571
Miluna, I'll go crazy.

714
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:52,449
Don't cry, Yours will write you, too.
_He won't. 

715
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:56,844
I was too mean for him.

716
00:57:57,336 --> 00:58:00,931
I'll never marry.
-Milu, don't cry.

717
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:03,409
Know what?

718
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:07,211
I won't marry to Italy without you.
Promise.

719
00:58:11,736 --> 00:58:14,250
You're so good to me.
-I know.

720
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:21,056
Travel agency!
Not a bad idea.

721
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:23,331
I'm telling you all afternoon.

722
00:58:23,576 --> 00:58:25,089
Think of Vachout family.

723
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,685
They have camp next to river.

724
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:29,693
We should see into that.

725
00:58:29,936 --> 00:58:34,248
We should visit people in village
and offer them to get clients.

726
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:38,165
No troubles for them and we'll
get bonus. Not bad.

727
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:41,524
Live in the tent all the sumer long?

728
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:45,450
Ill kidneys, ovaries and mosquitos.
Don't do that.

729
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:48,654
Sweethearts, I baked buns for you.

730
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:52,650
They're burnt a bit, but you'll
like them nevertheless. 

731
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,366
I'd be fat.
-Oh, please.

732
00:58:56,576 --> 00:59:01,092
Gabby, it's pure chemistry.

733
00:59:01,336 --> 00:59:06,205
Vendy and Jaruš will eat them in no time.

734
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:09,528
Sugar, please.
I'll bring it immediatelly, honey.

735
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:13,208
Sugar's coming.

736
00:59:14,296 --> 00:59:18,050
Vendy, Gabby, eat quickly
or it'll go cold.

737
00:59:29,576 --> 00:59:31,055
Say you like it.

738
00:59:32,296 --> 00:59:35,208
What a mess.
Where did I put it?

739
00:59:35,456 --> 00:59:39,449
Kája, didn't you see the red notepad?
Vendy, coming.

740
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:42,094
Here, baby.
-Thanks.

741
00:59:42,296 --> 00:59:45,413
Let's do it in great style.

742
00:59:45,696 --> 00:59:50,816
Hello girls.
Hey, that's the amazing burnt ones?

743
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:53,286
But the great style calls for...

744
00:59:53,976 --> 00:59:55,694
Well?
-PC

745
00:59:56,136 --> 00:59:59,367
Tss. Don't tell me.
-I have idea.

746
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:03,651
Otík.
-He won't lend you a thing.

747
01:00:04,576 --> 01:00:06,885
Why not buy it for ourselves?

748
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,128
He says all the time it's a win.

749
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:12,253
Let's buy it in Germany.

750
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:15,653
Please, no more garbage to house.

751
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:18,606
It's not. 

752
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:22,725
Have you seen the Italians?
They had everything programmed.

753
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:25,012
Feeding, milking, everything.

754
01:00:26,576 --> 01:00:29,249
PC is half of the job.

755
01:00:29,456 --> 01:00:33,005
For the handful of rabbits?
They'll die in no time.

756
01:00:33,656 --> 01:00:37,535
Handful? We decided to go in
great style!

757
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:42,531
What would you do with so much rabbits?
Thought it through ages ago.

758
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,055
Look:

759
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:47,890
School trips, hospital in Volynì,
hospice...

760
01:00:48,696 --> 01:00:50,334
not to mention pubs.

761
01:00:50,656 --> 01:00:52,214
Where do you get money?

762
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:54,846
You need foreign money to buy PC.

763
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:57,212
Do you have it? Shit.

764
01:00:57,456 --> 01:01:00,846
Who needs foreign money?

765
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:04,169
We still have mom's teeth.

766
01:01:05,088 --> 01:01:07,881
<i>Vahotova: Stole vegetables.
Jirka: Lying, smokes, skips school.

767
01:01:08,304 --> 01:01:11,242
<i>Radlova: gazes on other men.

768
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:15,051
The chairman lent the boy scouts
seven times.

769
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:19,050
used the same speech for October revolution
Anniversary - 22x

770
01:01:19,296 --> 01:01:25,326
borrowed the church chairs for the meetings
11x - no, 12x.

771
01:01:27,496 --> 01:01:31,887
And when they returned it,
there were all puked over.

772
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:37,085
Right you are, Cecilie. Puked over.
Is this allright, Father?

773
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:40,054
What do you say?
What?

774
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:47,854
Please, Lord, not yet!
Not yet!

775
01:01:48,136 --> 01:01:50,366
Christ, what's wrong?

776
01:01:51,136 --> 01:01:53,730
It's me, your Cecilka.

777
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:56,494
Where did you get it?

778
01:01:57,136 --> 01:02:01,015
In the attic. Americans left it here
in 1945.

779
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:13,724
Mom, dad, the mill is haunted!
-Haunted my leg!

780
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:16,245
Sit and eat, it's cold already.

781
01:02:17,136 --> 01:02:19,730
Look, there's light.

782
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:23,488
I bet Josef is painting the scenery.

783
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:29,051
<i>She swallowed water...

784
01:02:30,536 --> 01:02:31,936
Chrissake..

785
01:02:34,176 --> 01:02:36,087
Hu, huu!

786
01:02:37,496 --> 01:02:40,056
Dude, you look awful.

787
01:02:40,896 --> 01:02:44,047
Come here and take a sip.

788
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:48,371
Do you know me?
-Sure, dude.

789
01:02:49,496 --> 01:02:50,861
Lenin!

790
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:56,129
Here, drink. Don't have this at home
anymore.

791
01:02:59,496 --> 01:03:00,896
Drink...

792
01:03:01,096 --> 01:03:03,212
Wait, what about me?

793
01:03:03,496 --> 01:03:06,329
Don't you dare to finish it alone.

794
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:09,489
Lenin!

795
01:03:09,856 --> 01:03:11,847
With my bottle, too!

796
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:15,407
Lenin, where are you? Lenin?

797
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:19,889
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
-I don't get it, Karel.

798
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:25,052
Pay no heed to it, mom.
I bet it's just some provoking.

799
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,728
Come.

800
01:04:02,856 --> 01:04:05,876
Jaruš, tell them
it's the last one.

801
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:08,896
If they need more, send them to
town hall.

802
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:11,854
Drive carefuly, they're brand new.

803
01:04:12,096 --> 01:04:14,530
Nobody ever read it.

804
01:04:18,976 --> 01:04:20,614
Professor!

805
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:22,534
Proffesor!

806
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:24,736
What?

807
01:04:25,016 --> 01:04:29,294
You lost some Gottwald!
-I see.

808
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:30,895
Pepíèek?

809
01:04:30,896 --> 01:04:33,330
Pepíèek, come here, please.

810
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:38,809
Go pick up the comrade president. 

811
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:41,734
This is thrilling.

812
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:46,130
Jaruška, please!
Classics to the barn?

813
01:04:46,776 --> 01:04:48,368
What to do with it?

814
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:53,007
I vote for burning it.
-We democrats don't burn books.

815
01:04:53,296 --> 01:04:57,301
Vendy said that not even the used books
shop will buy it, 

816
01:04:57,336 --> 01:05:01,295
so before we throw it away,
it will serve to good purpose.

817
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:05,564
Ladies, lesson number one.

818
01:05:06,656 --> 01:05:11,047
Body posture and the nudist beach 
walking with smile.

819
01:05:12,456 --> 01:05:15,607
With the help of these books.

820
01:05:15,776 --> 01:05:19,086
Let's put them on heads, ladies,
and step out. 

821
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:27,571
Nicely, charmingly, show your breasts
and let's go.

822
01:05:28,296 --> 01:05:33,211
One, two, three...
Ladies, go, go.

823
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:37,167
That's right...

824
01:05:38,136 --> 01:05:44,291
Nice. Next lady...
Smile, show your teeth...

825
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:46,931
Well done.

826
01:05:47,296 --> 01:05:51,574
If the books slips, don't worry,
we have plenty. Next one...

827
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:55,644
Charmingly, ladies,
show the breasts...

828
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,448
Next one, go...

829
01:06:18,896 --> 01:06:20,409
When Italians see this,

830
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:24,131
they'll give us everything
and run away.

831
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,452
Represent!

832
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:30,132
Ladies did it wonderfully.

833
01:06:38,176 --> 01:06:40,690
They are naturals.

834
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:42,896
Sorry.
 
835
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:56,048
Ja, bitte...

836
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:57,449

837
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:00,056
Hubby, some bull.

838
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:05,854
Yeah, yeah. 

839
01:07:06,616 --> 01:07:09,176
Isn't that too small for the price?

840
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:10,816
Well...

841
01:07:11,336 --> 01:07:13,861
How can rabbits fit in?

842
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:17,216
That's allright.
-And won't it speak German?

843
01:07:17,251 --> 01:07:19,013
We'd understand shit.

844
01:07:21,256 --> 01:07:24,293
Sorry?
-Will you pay cheque or cash?

845
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:26,856
In gold.

846
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:31,575
Na bitte.

847
01:07:33,656 --> 01:07:35,169
Genuine gold.

848
01:07:39,616 --> 01:07:42,733
<i>Na ja, gold, aber...

849
01:07:43,016 --> 01:07:44,416
What aber?

850
01:07:44,616 --> 01:07:46,016
Is it gold or what?

851
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:49,054
Count it quickly, we have no time.

852
01:07:49,296 --> 01:07:51,651
That's too little.

853
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:56,806
Little? When was the last time
you've seen so much gold?

854
01:07:57,256 --> 01:08:01,488
These are teeth from my father.
From the Austrian empire.

855
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:05,570
And that was some gold.

856
01:08:05,896 --> 01:08:09,809
You have to pay more.

857
01:08:11,096 --> 01:08:12,688
Pay more?

858
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:16,015
How much more he wants for that junk?

859
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:22,536
Genuine Gottwald.

860
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:35,405
125 Marks...

861
01:08:36,176 --> 01:08:41,933
125? It's worth more, my dear German boy.

862
01:08:42,936 --> 01:08:45,894
<i>Bitte, ein Gottwald ist fünf mark.

863
01:08:46,576 --> 01:08:51,650
Not fünf, but acht - eight!
I know it well.

864
01:08:52,096 --> 01:08:57,170
From Rosie. She was in Austria
and they gave them eight!

865
01:08:57,656 --> 01:09:00,170
Understand?
We are no cheats.

866
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:03,254
How to say it in German?
Unter wassermen, understand?

867
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:07,250
We are honest farmers from Hoštice!
Verstehen? Acht!

868
01:09:11,336 --> 01:09:13,406
Dad!
God help you!

869
01:09:14,456 --> 01:09:17,926
Pay attention, I write.
-That's what I call art.

870
01:09:19,056 --> 01:09:20,456
It looks almost alive.

871
01:09:20,576 --> 01:09:24,251
After so many years and 
finally it's possible.

872
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:27,886
<i>Nach links, ja?

873
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:30,168
To whom they belong to?

874
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:31,776
How can I tell?

875
01:09:31,896 --> 01:09:36,014
They are ours and they like it very much.
They'll come again next year.

876
01:09:36,216 --> 01:09:37,616
OK.

877
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:45,966
If this continues, one can't 
understand anymore.

878
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:48,741
I'm old and don't wish to learn German.

879
01:09:48,776 --> 01:09:53,256
Promise me everyting is allright
before Bernardo arrives.

880
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:56,885
What day is today? -Tuesday.

881
01:09:57,216 --> 01:10:00,367
25., Let's do salary.

882
01:10:01,056 --> 01:10:04,128
Oh! Nettle! Cut it down!

883
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,255
We were to...
I know, Grüssgott.

884
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,849
Munich.

885
01:10:18,096 --> 01:10:19,496
Munich.

886
01:10:23,896 --> 01:10:27,172
Don't hit it so hard.

887
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,448
Did you washed your hands?
-Leave me alone.

888
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:32,493
Now I lost it!

889
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,661
I told you not to let him.

890
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:39,211
It's easy.
We play games at school on it.

891
01:10:39,576 --> 01:10:44,889
Play games on such expensive machine?
Don't you dare or I'll break your arms.

892
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:50,287
Look, there's some icon now.
-I can see that, but what for?

893
01:10:50,656 --> 01:10:53,807
It's written there.
Press return and continue.

894
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:57,850
I told you it will emit in German.
Do you know how to say rabbit in German?

895
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,934
Wait...

896
01:11:02,576 --> 01:11:06,364
Here you are. And now you can
use it as the typewriter.

897
01:11:10,696 --> 01:11:12,015
Dad.
-What?

898
01:11:12,016 --> 01:11:13,847
You've got typo there.
-Where?

899
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:17,970
Chrissake, female with two ee!

900
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:22,332
What's wrong with feemale?
It looks stupid with single e.

901
01:11:22,536 --> 01:11:24,447
Females. Five females.

902
01:11:25,456 --> 01:11:27,731
When you have doubts,
think of similar words.

903
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:30,941
Feelings, feeble, fee... 

904
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:34,366
You already forgot everything
that you learned at school.

905
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:36,606
Do you have any feemale there?
-There!

906
01:11:36,856 --> 01:11:40,892
The only thing female needs to be long
is her hair!

907
01:11:41,136 --> 01:11:44,112
Cover it, they don't need to know
we've got computer.

908
01:11:44,147 --> 01:11:47,088
Why? We haven't steal it.
-They don't need to know. Enter!

909
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,655
Hello.

910
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:52,406
Hi.
-I'll be quick.

911
01:11:52,616 --> 01:11:55,972
I saw you returning from
Germany so I wanted to ask

912
01:11:56,216 --> 01:12:00,176
if you want to sign the deal with
our travel agency called <i>Solstice</i>.

913
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:04,215
What kind of deal?
-Rent the house for summer.

914
01:12:04,456 --> 01:12:08,165
Germans, French, other foreigners.
-We need to think it through.

915
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:11,607
40 Marks per night.
3/4 of the village already signed.

916
01:12:12,616 --> 01:12:14,493
Chairman as well?

917
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:18,415
<i>Solstice</i> works dependably. 

918
01:12:18,976 --> 01:12:22,252
We observe the thing with Italians-

919
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:24,925
they'll stay in houses of our 
clients

920
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:27,730
and afterwards plenty of
Westerners will be interested.

921
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:30,496
In the meantime we should stay
in the attic?

922
01:12:30,736 --> 01:12:34,331
In tent near the river. Mind of
Vachout family, how they prosper.

923
01:12:34,496 --> 01:12:37,727
And they can't speak German nor English.
Speak!

924
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:41,611
You'll let everything as it is
and make it available for tourists.

925
01:12:41,896 --> 01:12:44,456
The thing is to make them feel
at home.

926
01:12:45,296 --> 01:12:50,086
Let's clean this place, whiten the 
facade, flowers at windows..

927
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:53,254
Riverside is warm at summer,
we can endure it for time.

928
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:58,126
Others endured, so we will.
Where should I sign it?

929
01:13:14,616 --> 01:13:19,246
Cecilie, for God's sake,
where did you get this beast?

930
01:13:19,656 --> 01:13:23,615
Told you I prepared something.

931
01:13:23,856 --> 01:13:26,973
Old Jeremiah woman lent him to me.

932
01:13:27,176 --> 01:13:32,887
He could kill a man easilly!
-Father, he's just a pup.

933
01:13:33,336 --> 01:13:36,373
Puppy my leg!
-Make it go outside, Cecilka!

934
01:13:36,696 --> 01:13:38,573
Let's go Broèek. Did you hear?

935
01:13:38,896 --> 01:13:42,935
You're stroke squad indeed!
-Yeah.

936
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:48,488
If only he howls.
Howl, Broèek, howl!

937
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:55,526
Like this: Hoo! Hoo!
-You call this howling?

938
01:13:56,416 --> 01:14:00,170
You have to do it right, deeply.
Like this:

939
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,206
Hoo...

940
01:14:06,016 --> 01:14:11,170
Hoo...
-Low pitch, not high!

941
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:22,006
Chrissake, they don't know where 
to put me. I wanna downstairs!

942
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:25,891
I'm scared!
-Of what?

943
01:14:26,136 --> 01:14:28,127
We are all present!

944
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:32,489
It's just a test of endurance.

945
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:37,372
Tomorrow we'll be in tent next to river.
C'mon.

946
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:41,216
We do it for our well-being.

947
01:14:41,251 --> 01:14:44,094
I'll run away! I'm afraid.

948
01:14:45,616 --> 01:14:48,847
Be glad we lifted you up here.

949
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:51,092
Chrissake...

950
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:57,013
Do you hear that too? Suspicious.
-Just dogs from the village.

951
01:14:57,376 --> 01:15:01,813
They sing to the moon.
-So weird? It's scary.

952
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:06,289
Bro, catch.
-It feels like at wartime.

953
01:15:06,616 --> 01:15:11,406
You wouldn't eat so well at wartime.
Give me bread for mom.

954
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:14,216
Mom!

955
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,609
Jesus, where did she go?

956
01:15:20,776 --> 01:15:25,531
Where did you burrow?
You drive me mad!

957
01:15:26,216 --> 01:15:29,413
Jesus! My back hurts!

958
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:35,013
Since morning.
I bet it's the sun erections.

959
01:15:35,296 --> 01:15:39,084
That's the black dog from mill.
I'm scared!

960
01:15:39,256 --> 01:15:43,295
I wish he wants to eat you!
-But the howling is weird anyway.

961
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:47,169
That's it!

962
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:51,051
Nothing on this world would
howl like that.

963
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,816
Father!

964
01:15:52,976 --> 01:15:55,934
Chrissake, Father!

965
01:15:56,376 --> 01:15:58,207
Father!

966
01:15:58,616 --> 01:16:02,165
Father!
-It's Maøenka.

967
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:05,692
Open up!
-Something happened.

968
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:09,374
Open up, Father!

969
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:13,809
What's going on, Kelišová?
-Open up!

970
01:16:14,056 --> 01:16:18,095
Father, the mill is haunted 
for sure.

971
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:22,689
Beat it, woman!
There are no spooks.

972
01:16:23,576 --> 01:16:26,409
Maøenka...
-Aaaa...

973
01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:32,656
See?

974
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:37,092
That's weird.
-Strange.

975
01:16:39,336 --> 01:16:41,725
Let's go, guys.
-Keep it.

976
01:17:02,936 --> 01:17:06,531
Come here, dude. Look.
-Don't shout, they'll hear us.

977
01:17:13,176 --> 01:17:15,815
There are spooks for sure.

978
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:25,334
Aaaa!

979
01:17:51,936 --> 01:17:55,531
Girls from the village!
Jiøina, Anèa!

980
01:17:55,896 --> 01:18:00,606
That's our Anèa! I'll slap your ass,
you'll see at home.

981
01:18:01,736 --> 01:18:03,136
Look!

982
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:08,772
It's a mask.

983
01:18:16,216 --> 01:18:17,934
Aaaa!

984
01:18:25,976 --> 01:18:29,855
I thought I died, Father.
-Hm.

985
01:18:30,376 --> 01:18:33,288
You both drink it.

986
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,566
Where are the pills for sweating?

987
01:18:37,856 --> 01:18:41,053
In the cupboard, under St. Therese.

988
01:18:41,336 --> 01:18:43,213
Under Therese.

989
01:18:47,736 --> 01:18:51,490
If only you could see that...
-What?

990
01:18:53,176 --> 01:18:55,087
The blonde...

991
01:18:55,456 --> 01:18:58,607
He looked just like my dead husband.

992
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:04,810
Bless you.
-Right.

993
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:12,051
Where should I put it?
-There.

994
01:19:14,536 --> 01:19:16,208
Here you have another. 

995
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:21,968
Pedestrians not allowed!
And don't run so fast here.

996
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:28,970
Why you bring it here?
Just in front of our tent!

997
01:19:29,856 --> 01:19:32,654
The decision about the beach
was made, so what?

998
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:36,849
Just following orders.
-What orders?

999
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:39,564
This land belongs to Co-op.

1000
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:43,286
Be glad we let you set your
tents here and for free!

1001
01:19:43,456 --> 01:19:44,935
Yeah.

1002
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:52,247
You can remain here under single
condition.

1003
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,729
You have to be naked.
Read the sign.

1004
01:19:55,976 --> 01:19:59,013
Chrissake, he's crazy!

1005
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:05,764
Who's crazy? You vote for it
and here you are.

1006
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:10,128
They move one out of his house
to eat the dirt

1007
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:12,621
and even demand our nudity!

1008
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:17,013
I find it very usual.
You're so backwards!

1009
01:20:17,216 --> 01:20:19,286
Jesus!
-Naked?

1010
01:20:19,496 --> 01:20:21,612
See that, mom?

1011
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:24,813
See? No problem, girls.

1012
01:20:25,056 --> 01:20:35,686
I can undress as well, nothing
to be ashamed for. -God, no!

1013
01:20:37,896 --> 01:20:39,095
What do you say?

1014
01:20:39,096 --> 01:20:40,496
Come, hubby!

1015
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:42,953
Me too, me too!
-Don't start!

1016
01:20:42,988 --> 01:20:45,371
You'll get me to the asylum!

1017
01:20:45,576 --> 01:20:49,171
Healty spirit in healthy body, ladies.
-You, doctor?

1018
01:20:56,216 --> 01:20:59,014
Nudes!

1019
01:20:59,456 --> 01:21:03,574
Hubby, I never undressed
in front of so many men!

1020
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:07,052
So what, shit happens.

1021
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:09,968
Oh!

1022
01:21:19,376 --> 01:21:22,413
Chrissake! Sodom and Gomorrah!

1023
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:28,614
What's going on?
-Everybody's nuts!

1024
01:21:28,856 --> 01:21:32,166
They're all naked and
want us as well.

1025
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,926
Don't cry.

1026
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:40,289
So we move our stuff beyond the signs.

1027
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,851
It doesn't apply beyond this line.

1028
01:21:43,136 --> 01:21:46,446
Great idea, Hubby.

1029
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:49,816
Right?

1030
01:21:50,216 --> 01:21:52,252
You moron!

1031
01:22:03,656 --> 01:22:06,045
Father, Father!

1032
01:22:07,016 --> 01:22:08,416
It's happening!

1033
01:22:08,936 --> 01:22:11,689
Father, it's happening!

1034
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:15,335
Father, it's here!

1035
01:22:15,896 --> 01:22:19,047
What's here, Kelišová?
-Father! -What?

1036
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:22,812
Sodom and Gomorrah! They're undressing.
-No!

1037
01:22:22,976 --> 01:22:26,491
Men, women, together and nude!

1038
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:28,732
Hurry, Kelišová!

1039
01:22:33,136 --> 01:22:36,287
Jump on.

1040
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:40,373
Hurry, Father.

1041
01:22:40,408 --> 01:22:42,531
Like in good times!
-Yeah.

1042
01:23:04,336 --> 01:23:06,133
<i>Attention.

1043
01:23:06,576 --> 01:23:10,854
<i>We ask all who participate
at nudist beach training

1044
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:15,090
<i>to go immediatelly into
the mill for public test.

1045
01:23:15,336 --> 01:23:16,736
<i>I repeat.

1046
01:23:16,856 --> 01:23:21,054
<i>Nudist beach trainees
imediatelly to the mill.

1047
01:23:30,216 --> 01:23:33,253
I wonder who appears first.
Not me.

1048
01:23:33,536 --> 01:23:35,811
No one's sending you.

1049
01:23:39,496 --> 01:23:43,887
I won't go first.
Right. Get out with it.

1050
01:23:44,096 --> 01:23:46,291
For aerobic. Got it in Rome.

1051
01:23:46,576 --> 01:23:51,525
I promised help, cooking, cleaning,
but won't appear nude!

1052
01:23:52,256 --> 01:23:56,886
We're here for Italians and not for 
Hoštice. Villagers are peeking!

1053
01:23:57,096 --> 01:24:00,656
You practiced so long and now
you won't do it?

1054
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:02,692
We weren't naked.

1055
01:24:03,936 --> 01:24:06,609
It was just a test.

1056
01:24:07,696 --> 01:24:10,130
But we weren't naked back then.

1057
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,645
And now you will. So what.

1058
01:24:12,936 --> 01:24:16,975
Peace, girls.
How we studied it?

1059
01:24:17,256 --> 01:24:21,886
Get ready. Smile and show all the world

1060
01:24:23,096 --> 01:24:28,011
that even simple Czech woman
can behave like lady.

1061
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:32,451
No Italian won't faint seeing 
you in boots and with pitchforks.

1062
01:24:32,816 --> 01:24:36,047
I'm out of here.
Let the young girls do that.

1063
01:24:36,256 --> 01:24:38,406
Right.
-Wait here.

1064
01:24:38,776 --> 01:24:40,607
That wasn't the deal.

1065
01:24:40,896 --> 01:24:44,969
Don't you dare!
You'll get benefits anyway.

1066
01:24:45,176 --> 01:24:48,054
Let us go.
-Deal's the deal.

1067
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:52,568
You're terrible.

1068
01:24:52,816 --> 01:24:55,774
They undressed in the morning
and nobody minded.

1069
01:24:55,976 --> 01:24:58,695
You misunderstood. Don't you dare, Gabby!

1070
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:02,934
Stop it or I'll
divorce you!

1071
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:05,525
He wants us undressed but not his wife!

1072
01:25:05,816 --> 01:25:10,571
Let the bastard undress himself!
-Are you nuts?

1073
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:13,855
Help! Help me!

1074
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:16,924
Help! Ow, Matoušková! Ow!

1075
01:25:17,256 --> 01:25:20,931
That's unheard of!
-Silence!

1076
01:25:21,176 --> 01:25:23,167
Look, it's started.

1077
01:25:23,576 --> 01:25:26,249
Are you nuts?

1078
01:25:32,096 --> 01:25:34,974
Open up, women! You hear me?

1079
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:40,974
Let me go. That's a mistake.
This shouldn't happen.

1080
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:44,214
The boy's life is endangered!

1081
01:25:44,456 --> 01:25:46,412
C'mon, open up!

1082
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:57,732
That's not my fault!

1083
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,611
Chrissake!
-Help!

1084
01:26:01,976 --> 01:26:04,251
Ow! What's wrong with you?

1085
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:11,652
The Italians will love it.

1086
01:27:18,496 --> 01:27:19,896
Damn!

1087
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:25,445
Do it again! Do it again!

1088
01:27:26,776 --> 01:27:29,415
Patience, please.

1089
01:27:29,816 --> 01:27:32,614
Friends, due the technical
dificulties

1090
01:27:32,896 --> 01:27:37,253
our program begins with parade
of beach hostesses.

1091
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:40,728
Let's go, girls.

1092
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:44,893
Don't be shy.

1093
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:42,289
Chairman!

1094
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:44,009
Chairman!

1095
01:28:44,896 --> 01:28:47,968
What? Chairman, we're screwed?
-Why so?

1096
01:28:48,176 --> 01:28:51,054
Italians in the village!
-Wait.

1097
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:53,176
How so?

1098
01:28:53,216 --> 01:28:56,174
You have to take it.
The national's commitee ordered

1099
01:28:56,256 --> 01:28:58,724
and I don't want any trouble.

1100
01:28:58,976 --> 01:29:02,093
<i>Grazie, signora.

1101
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:06,809
Don't you have something
to drink?

1102
01:29:07,336 --> 01:29:09,167
Didn't say anything about drink.

1103
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,787
The well is there.
<i>- Grazie.</i>

1104
01:29:37,176 --> 01:29:42,045
<i>Signora Maria!
-Padre! -Signora!

1105
01:29:44,096 --> 01:29:47,486
It's good to see you again!
-Maria!

1106
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:54,848
This is my Cecilka.

1107
01:29:55,336 --> 01:29:57,531
Cecilia...

1108
01:30:02,816 --> 01:30:06,206
Padre spoke highly of you.

1109
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:10,834
<i>Pepa, amico!

1110
01:30:14,936 --> 01:30:17,848
Pepo, are you surprised we're already here?

1111
01:30:19,376 --> 01:30:20,776
Yeah.

1112
01:30:24,456 --> 01:30:25,935
Girls, go.

1113
01:30:26,976 --> 01:30:29,934
Smile, we learned that.

1114
01:30:30,336 --> 01:30:31,736
Don't be shy...

1115
01:30:32,936 --> 01:30:37,691
Sodom and Gomorrah!
-I know that.

1116
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:43,016
They're part-timers.
It's art and their hobby.

1117
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:45,655
It's our new tradition.
-Split.

1118
01:30:45,856 --> 01:30:48,501
First you wanted us wordly and now
you don't. 

1119
01:30:48,536 --> 01:30:52,006
Girls, let's have shot.
<i>- Presidento mio!</i>

1120
01:30:54,056 --> 01:30:58,015
Bernardo, Bernardo mio!
-Evik!

1121
01:31:17,896 --> 01:31:21,605
Miluna mia!
-Vincenzo! -Amore.

1122
01:31:55,736 --> 01:31:57,136
I'm satisfied.

1123
01:31:57,296 --> 01:32:00,606
We can sign the contract
immediatelly. 

1124
01:32:00,856 --> 01:32:05,008
But we couldn't even set it right.

1125
01:32:05,976 --> 01:32:09,127
No, no, let it be.

1126
01:32:10,336 --> 01:32:11,736
How so?

1127
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:13,136
How so?

1128
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:17,886
You haven't seen a thing yet.

1129
01:32:19,296 --> 01:32:20,696
We know it all.

1130
01:32:20,856 --> 01:32:23,654
We researched you

1131
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,166
and now we know even what's not true.

1132
01:32:26,656 --> 01:32:28,931
We want to make museum out of your farm.

1133
01:32:29,496 --> 01:32:30,896
Museum.

1134
01:32:33,576 --> 01:32:37,205
Natural museum.
And the whole world would come to see

1135
01:32:37,456 --> 01:32:40,336
in what enviroment began
the Plánièka method.

1136
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:46,013
And tourists mean money.

1137
01:32:46,496 --> 01:32:51,286
And we'll use your toxic milk
to make buttons.

1138
01:32:51,576 --> 01:32:54,136
Perfect business.
-Bravo!

1139
01:32:55,976 --> 01:32:59,286
What will happen to us?
-How should I know?

1140
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:01,886
Nothing, exactly how it was.

1141
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:06,926
Even the personnel.
Agree?

1142
01:33:08,936 --> 01:33:10,528
Well...
-Wait!

1143
01:33:10,816 --> 01:33:15,048
Know what it means?
We'll be clowns for the whole Europe!

1144
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,929
We did it forty years for free,

1145
01:33:18,136 --> 01:33:21,412
so now we'll be at least paid!

1146
01:33:25,536 --> 01:33:27,049
Don't wait!

1147
01:33:27,376 --> 01:33:29,207
Don't stare and write!

1148
01:33:29,456 --> 01:33:31,333
Pepa...
-Glasses.

1149
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:35,376
Right hand!

1150
01:33:38,016 --> 01:33:39,416
So!

1151
01:33:45,616 --> 01:33:47,493
Amici, bravo!

1152
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:51,127
Long live the president!

1153
01:33:51,896 --> 01:33:55,969
God, it's here!
It's here!

1154
01:33:56,696 --> 01:34:01,690
It's here! It's here!
It's here...

1155
01:34:06,256 --> 01:34:08,856
Mom, I'll make the pillow
so soft

1156
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:10,767
you'll think you're in paradise.

1157
01:34:11,296 --> 01:34:12,696
There...

1158
01:34:13,256 --> 01:34:16,168
And the hair...
Kiss!

1159
01:34:17,656 --> 01:34:19,726
Dominik, Dominik...

1160
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:24,536
Venca, did you cut the grass?
-Don't bother me with grass.

1161
01:34:24,571 --> 01:34:28,290
Rabbits will be hungry in the evening.

1162
01:34:32,776 --> 01:34:34,767
Brmbrm...

1163
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,288
Lady.
-I can see.

1164
01:34:55,896 --> 01:34:57,296
Hi.

1165
01:34:57,336 --> 01:34:58,736
May I?

1166
01:35:03,096 --> 01:35:04,609
Thanks.

1167
01:35:07,576 --> 01:35:08,976
Nice.

1168
01:35:10,056 --> 01:35:11,774
Good luck.

1169
01:35:12,096 --> 01:35:13,575
Thanks.

1170
01:35:19,896 --> 01:35:23,775
Bye, lady, bye.

1171
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:51,486
Don't cry! You have Venca
and the baby.

1172
01:35:51,896 --> 01:35:55,445
That is car allright.
Wish I had it...

1173
01:35:55,656 --> 01:35:58,329
You'll have, and better one. 
We'll have it all.

1174
01:35:58,816 --> 01:36:02,047
The future will be so bright
we didn't even dream of.

1175
01:36:02,296 --> 01:36:03,968
I can see it clearly.

1176
01:36:05,616 --> 01:36:09,734
Earth's paradise. Happy future.

1177
01:36:10,656 --> 01:36:12,726
Three cars here.

1178
01:36:13,416 --> 01:36:15,213
Swimming pool with air-condition.

1179
01:36:15,576 --> 01:36:18,648
We'll have phone even in the barn.

1180
01:36:20,496 --> 01:36:24,284
And the whole world will be amazed
what we Czechs are like.

1181
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,492
We're saavy.

1182
01:36:27,936 --> 01:36:31,611
Especialy when we are one step

1183
01:36:33,296 --> 01:36:34,968
in Europe.
