1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,120
Into the corner!

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,360
- Calm down. Coming for lunch?
- Whom do you have here?

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,200
- Just Zubor and a few animals.
- We'll take a look.

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,640
Two, three, four.
Two beggars eat from four plates?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,000
You'd better not go there.
Frankie is sleeping there.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,440
He hasn't eaten yet.
Might tear up your pants.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,240
Who's Frankie?

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
This should scare me?

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,520
- You know better.
- And who eats from the fourth plate?

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
- Mike. - And who's that?

11
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,360
Frankie's father, a nasty fighter.
Yesterday he tore two of my dogs

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,000
to pieces. Shall I wake him up? Mike!

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,760
- No, we're in a hurry. - Come on out!
The gentlemen want to see you!

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,040
On the horses, let's be off!

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,160
To the table.

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,760
You've come such a distance.
You must have set off at dawn. Why?

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,600
- I wanted to see you.
- And why did you want to see me?

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,480
Because...

19
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Because I liked the way
you saved the boy from punishment.

20
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Me? He just chose the right hand, that's all.

21
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,320
And what was in your other hand?

22
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,400
You saw it? You have sharp eyes.
Sharp by name, sharp by nature.

23
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,880
I must be back by sunset.

24
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,360
My parents don't want us
to meet until the wedding.

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,520
I told them I would go hunting.

26
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,040
I haven't behaved honestly.

27
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,480
I think...

28
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,360
I can forgive you.

29
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,240
- You should go now.
- I'd like to see you again soon.

30
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,200
Better not. Do you want to spend your horse?

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,960
But the day after tomorrow

32
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll be passing this way.

33
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,480
Thomas! Are you mad? Here... by the castle!

34
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,600
The constables are looking for you.
Father will have you caned.

35
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
You wouldn't survive it!

36
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,280
I just wanted to tell you...

37
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
My grandpa said...

38
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,520
I grow really fast. Soon I'll be grown up...

39
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
and strong like my father was.

40
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,040
If you could just wait I could be your...

41
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,760
Tom, I know...

42
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,840
I just thought Ostrik could find
another girl... I'd help him.

43
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,960
You saw us?

44
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,320
You know, I like Ostrik, I do.

45
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,400
And I love him.

46
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
To fall in love with my future husband...

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,640
I can call myself lucky.
It's not always like that.

48
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,160
I wish you all the luck.

49
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,080
For good luck... may it stay with you.

50
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
You're a nice boy.

51
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,960
Perun, go.

52
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,400
Thomas, come here.

53
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,240
I've been training him for months.
He's good but unpredictable.

54
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,960
Tie this to his foot.

55
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
And how is Formina?

56
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,480
What do you know about her?

57
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,920
Only what you talk about...

58
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,760
in your sleep. Wash your eyes,
they are a little red.

59
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,840
It's hopeless.

60
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Tatar! Halt! Back!

61
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,000
The fox must be rabid.

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,400
We have to kill it or
it'll infect all our animals.

63
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,320
What has got into you?

64
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,200
He'll never come back.

65
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,160
What have you done? I tried everything...

66
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,280
I told him a falcon should not
behave like a donkey.

67
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,200
From now on, you train him.

68
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,520
Look... Thomas is sending us his greetings.

69
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,760
Frankie, come and have a bath!

70
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,800
- Won't you miss him? - I will.

71
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,080
But I know a better one.
A falcon beyond compare!

72
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,520
I know which one you mean.
I nearly trapped him with my net.

73
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,960
He's the king of all falcons.

74
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,480
- Shall I stop at your Grandpa's? - No need.

75
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,840
- You'll meet him at the castle.
- How do you know?

76
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,960
The falcon told me.

77
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,120
Hey, catch!

78
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's for Formina.

79
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,520
You can't go in there!
His lordship has forbidden it.

80
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,280
- I've come to beg for my grandson.
- First I want to know where he is.

81
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,440
- Speak! - I don't know, my lord.

82
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,280
- On my honour I don't know.
- You don't know? I don't believe you!

83
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,960
- You should, my lord. - Vagan!
- Metod is an honest man.

84
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,560
- You've come to tell me that?
- I've brought you a falcon, my lord.

85
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,800
- And that's why I should believe you?
- This one is better than

86
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,400
- the one lver stole from me.
- Liar! Can you prove that?

87
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,440
Tell his lordship who gave you this scar.

88
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,400
You can keep your field
unless you deliver me Thomas.

89
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,680
If I find him myself
his punishment will be worse.

90
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,080
Get lost, you old fool.

91
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,760
I like him. We'll try him after lunch.

92
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,200
I saw a rat in the tower.

93
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,400
- Lf Balador sees it...
Where is the rat poison? - Over there.

94
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,440
But careful with it.

95
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,840
- You're not saying much, Vagan.
- Because I know little.

96
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
This morning you spoke more.

97
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Now I know even less
than I did this morning.

98
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,080
What counts is the falcon knows
what he has to know.

99
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,520
Let us begin.

100
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,480
Where is he flying?

101
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,520
You wanted to make a fool of me?
You've brought me a carcass.

102
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,120
The rabbit gave him heart attack!

103
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,520
Did you poison my falcon?

104
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,840
- I know nothing.
- And you brother "the falconer"?

105
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,880
- I've seen nothing.
- 'Cause you didn't want to see!

106
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,600
You're lucky I don't like
when people get whipped.

107
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,080
And tell lver to stay out of my way.
He's got one scar already.

108
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
My lady...

109
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,200
- Vagan! - I've got something for you.

110
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
You know where Thomas is?

111
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,560
Tell him, I'd like to dance with him
one more time before I get married.

112
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,040
Let's go.

113
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Hey, hands off from the nest!

114
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,760
You'll pay for this.
I'm Lord Balador's falconer!

115
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
- I'm following his orders.
- Liar! You're stealing the eggs.

116
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,640
Nonsense. You've hurt my arm. Help me...

117
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,120
He was stealing falcon eggs
and Lord Balador is looking for him

118
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,880
- because of Perun. - Put him down!

119
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,760
Move back!

120
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Lord Balador will punish everyone
who helps him escape and...

121
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,440
Shut up, lver. Now you listen to me!

122
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,680
You poisoned the falcon.

123
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,200
You used to be my pupil,
taught you everything.

124
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,240
And you've turned out to be a filthy thief.

125
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:26,080
Look: Hawk, sparrow hawk, peregrine.
The falconer robs his lord.

126
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,040
Stop that evil man!

127
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,560
Shoot him yourself if you feel like that...

128
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,880
He poisoned our falcon, alas!

129
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,560
We won't find a better one.

130
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,840
And what about that one?

131
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,760
It's him. The falcon king.

132
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,280
For him Balador would forgive you everything.

133
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,960
He'd also give me a castle.

134
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,200
Repair it! Stitch it again!

135
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,800
- Does it suit me?
- You're a beautiful bride.

136
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Enchanting.

137
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,080
Sugar...

138
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,280
Get lost!

139
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,320
My lord, I trained the falcon
you gonna give to Ostrik...

140
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,760
- What do you want? Spit it out!
- Could I be the head falconer?

141
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,640
- Your time will come.
- You should know that Vagan...

142
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,200
Do you know anything else
besides tale-bearing?

143
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,520
We're slow. I have to exercise my horse.
I'll meet you at the castle.

144
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,960
- Still the same hothead.
- Don't worry, he'll get tamed soon.

145
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,600
- And where is Ostrik? - He has to be here any moment now.

146
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,280
He rode ahead, was impatient.

147
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,720
He's savouring the last moments
of his freedom. Please...

148
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,040
What do you want from me?

149
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm thirsty.

150
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,080
I know you!

151
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
You made a big mistake.

152
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,520
Now you won't get out alive.
I'm not going to the gallows.

153
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,840
Why are you holding me here?
What are you up to?

154
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,880
It's none of your business.
I'm settling accounts.

155
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,080
If I discover a corpse here,
a reward would not come amiss.

156
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,320
I'm going to bed. If Ostrik appears
tell the maid to wake me up!

157
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,600
- I'd like to talk to him.
- No trace at all, nothing, my lord.

158
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:43,400
It's not possible! Looks like he
disappeared into thin air!

159
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,920
Take more men and keep
looking until you find him!

160
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,440
And bring us new candles.

161
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,840
Fly!

162
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,120
- We're looking for Ostrik.
- What would he do here?

163
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
We'll see. Search the place!

164
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
Stand up. Let's go.

165
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,120
Here's another one.

166
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,120
And here's the evidence!

167
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Tie them up. They are criminals!

168
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,000
It belongs to Ostrik.
I gave it to him myself.

169
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,520
We found it in Vagan's cottage.

170
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,440
- I bet they've robbed and murdered Ostrik.
- Vagan!

171
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,480
And Thomas! At last I've got you.
Where is Ostrik?

172
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,240
You're asking us? We know nothing.
We weren't invited to the wedding.

173
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,360
Thomas...

174
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,480
- Where is Ostrik?
- I drowned him in the mud. - Be serious!

175
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,920
- Do you know anything about him?
- Let me go and I'll find him.

176
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,040
Put them into the torture chamber!
The judge will try them!

177
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,200
- What have you found out?
- They denied everything stubbornly.

178
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,680
But the small one, Zubor, gave them away.

179
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,880
When he saw the red-hot iron
he nodded to everything.

180
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:29,560
- Anyway, this evidence is undeniable.
- And your verdict?

181
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,360
A life for a life, Your Highness.

182
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,880
Start buidilng the gallows.

183
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,360
And hurry up!

184
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,480
Thank you.

185
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,560
Thomas!

186
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:43,200
I begged my father but he doesn't want
to listen. I can't help you.

187
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,840
Tell me, what have you done to Ostrik?

188
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,240
If you believe we're able to kill
you'd better go. Get out of my sight!

189
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,880
Wait!

190
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,480
Watch out!

191
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll be back for you.

192
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
Be careful.

193
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,360
I'll find Ostrik for you even in hell.

194
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,560
Find Ostrik, find him.

195
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,680
What are you looking at?
You can't help me.

196
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,960
Sign here, my lord.

197
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,680
Father, how can you believe
Vagan or Thomas to be murderers?!

198
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:20,040
You can't send them to death.
Ostrik will return, I'm sure.

199
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,600
I believe he's alive because I love him.

200
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,360
Hey, help me! I'm here!

201
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,760
- You're all right? - My leg...

202
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,760
- How did you find me?
- Not me... he did.

203
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,000
He flew around my ears and
shouted "help Ostrik". So I came.

204
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,880
I had nothing else to do. Come on.

205
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,040
You understand the bird speech,
you suckling?

206
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,840
Sometimes better than the human speech,
you bridegroom!

207
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,880
- I've seen you somewhere.
- Maybe in the mud? - You're that dancer...

208
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,000
that insolent boy!
I wanted to give you a good hiding!

209
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,200
When you get well we can fight.

210
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,560
But now hold on so that
I don't lose you on the way.

211
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
These criminals have caused deep grief...

212
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,360
to Lord Donat, his wife, my daughter
Formina and to us all.

213
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,680
The judge decided they should be
hanged for their evil deed.

214
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,600
- My spur was the only evidence?
- Yeah. It was enough for the judge.

215
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,000
A judge like that ought
to get hanged himself! Wait.

216
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
- I've still got the other one.
- Other what?

217
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,240
- The other spur! - And I've got the falcon.

218
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,120
Fly!

219
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,920
...justice. A life for a life!

220
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Hangman,

221
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,160
do your business!

222
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,880
Here with it!

223
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,720
- Ostrik! - Hangman, hold it!

224
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,560
I am here! Stop that!

225
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,200
Ostrik!

226
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,200
Ostrik!

227
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,120
He's injured.

228
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,720
That's the man who wanted to kill me!

229
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
- Iver! - Let me go!

230
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,440
Ostrik...

231
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,760
Formina...

232
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,000
We almost executed innocent men.

233
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,560
Iver indicated to me
it was your wish, my lord...

234
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,160
You should follow the law
and your conscience, not lver.

235
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,400
I don't need a judge like that.
You'll go to the stocks.

236
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,080
- You're pale. - Just tired.

237
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,760
Come on, let's go.

238
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:29,360
- Thomas! - You little wanderer.
Do I have to cut the wood myself?

239
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,920
Grandpa, come on...

240
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,120
I'll forgive you Perun...
Haven't you worn out my bay?

241
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,080
- No. Anyway, it belongs to Ostrik now.
- You're forgetting something.

242
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,120
My lord.

243
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,000
It's the falcon king.
How did you achieve that?

244
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,960
I've promised a castle for him.
Now you are lord of a castle.

245
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,080
I don't want a castle. I'll keep the falcon.

246
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,080
In that case I'll make you my head falconer.

247
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,800
You've already got Vagan.
But when you go hunting...

248
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,000
- I will borrow you the falcon... my lord.
- My lord.

249
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,120
My lord...

250
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,840
I have wronged you, falconer.

251
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,520
You decide on his punishment.

252
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,240
I grant him mercy. But I will not ever
see him again in this region.

253
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,320
So be it.

254
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,960
Thank you for Ostrik and for me, Thomas.

255
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,120
- Without your help he wouldn't be here.
- I'd like to dance from joy.

256
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,120
But Ostrik can't.
Would you substitute for him?

257
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:38,400
It is not proper under the gallows.
Besides, I miss the healing mud.

258
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
Keep it.

259
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Leave it now. Go...

260
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,640
- We've come for you.
- Would you like to come with us?

261
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,320
I need a good falconer.

262
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,160
I'll think about it.
Maybe I'll fly to you one day.

263
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,480
The sooner the better.
