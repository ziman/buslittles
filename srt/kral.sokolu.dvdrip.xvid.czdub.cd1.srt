1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
Did you enjoy that?

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,080
We'll show Lord Balador the falconer
Vagan is still good at his craft.

3
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,280
Tomorrow you'll go to the castle.

4
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,720
Damned Vagan!

5
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,080
Beautiful...
Vagan promised me one like this.

6
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,840
I've been training it secretely for a year.
For you, my lord.

7
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,840
- Vagan is an old braggart.
- Stop it. I've heard enough!

8
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Well, people talk, my lord.
Here you are...

9
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,360
Wonderful, indeed.

10
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,160
Once hunting, I caught sight
of the famous King Mathew's falcon.

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,440
For that falcon I'd give my castle
on the Danube.

12
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,640
Nobody can catch that one, my lord.

13
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>Producer</i>

- Tomorrow we'll saddle the bay.
- God help us.

26
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
Father, Thomas! Lunch!

27
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,120
Hurry up, men,
Grandpa is starving.

28
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Come on, son.

29
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Here you are.

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,240
Grandpa, it's not just for you.

31
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Thomas!

32
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,320
Hey, calm down. I've heard you.

33
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,800
It's all right now.

34
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
Damned fool.

35
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,560
- You wanna get your ribs broken?
- The bay is death-ridden.

36
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,480
Yesterday you said
you were at death's door.

37
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,200
Right, but the door was sealed.
Death is scared of me.

38
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
Thomas, don't do that any more.

39
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Oh, my...

40
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,000
How did you know about the thorn?

41
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,600
The bay was complaining.
Are you deaf?

42
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,360
We are all deaf except for
master Thomas.

43
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,800
What did you tell her?

44
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,840
To throw a cone at you
if you don't stop neighing.

45
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,080
Liar! You liar!

46
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,600
Just you wait.

47
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
You robber...

48
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,600
With that whip of yours I'll change
the bay into a lamb tomorrow.

49
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,560
You touch the stud and Lord Balador
will get you caned.

50
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,520
- The bay cost him forty cows.
- And it's worth it, I'm telling you.

51
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,520
I've never seen
such a beauty in my life.

52
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,400
- Ostrik'll get the stud as a wedding gift.
- And he'll ride away on it...

53
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,400
- with beautiful Formina.
- And who is Formina?

54
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,640
He doesn't know who Formina is!

55
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:10,000
Lord Balador's daughter, born on the same
day as you only a year earlier.

56
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:20,160
The day you were born, at the castle
they celebrated her first birthday.

57
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,760
- So we're actually siblings.
- And I'm your Grandma! - Shut up.

58
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
- Forty cows for such a horse...
- Tell me about her. - Wait a moment.

59
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,680
Balador has offered a castle
for a falcon, just imagine.

60
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,840
The one with the golden crest?

61
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,040
The falcon belonged to the King
of Hungary. It saved his life.

62
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,520
People say so...

63
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,040
Once King Mathew got lost in the marsh.
He would have died there,

64
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,960
but his hunting falcon
showed him the way out.

65
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,480
- The King rewarded the bird with
a golden crest. - And set it free.

66
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,080
- What do you know about it?
- Nothing. Everyone'd do so, I guess.

67
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,000
Our smart Thomas
knows better than anyone.

68
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
You're lucky the marten is asleep.

69
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,920
- The little beast...
- It's your birthday in a few days...

70
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,520
Here's your present.

71
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
Wolves...

72
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
- The wolves! - Light up a big fire.
We'll drive them off.

73
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,600
You go left, I'll go right.
We'll meet back there.

74
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
You stay by the fire.

75
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,960
Thomas!

76
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,480
Put more wood to the fire!

77
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,880
- Are you okay? - Yeah!

78
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,840
Over here guys, help me!

79
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
I've got no fire!

80
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh, God...

81
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
Thomas, come back!

82
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
Father...

83
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,880
- Mama won't be lonesome any more.
- Now they are together again.

84
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,640
Thomas. Come on, let's go home.

85
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,400
What for? Balador will hire a new herdsman
and we can go begging.

86
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,320
Forward, jump! And back!

87
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,360
Sit...

88
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Perun, fetch!

89
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,280
Bravo, Perun!

90
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Me and my brother, we've prepared
a little surprise for you.

91
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,760
You are free. Run!

92
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
- What's this? - Be patient, my lord.

93
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,720
Perun, get him!

94
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,000
Let go!

95
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,440
- Perun, come here! - Wild beast.

96
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,880
- Isn't the lad hurt? - He deserved it.

97
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,000
- Broke a jug... - That's all?

98
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,480
And put the splinters into the dog food.
Perun could've died.

99
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,040
Punish him. But not like this.
According to the law.

100
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,960
Put him to the stocks and then cane him.

101
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,280
I'll plead with Lord Balador for
a piece of land. He'll remember me.

102
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,280
Once he went hunting and passed by...
I bowed and he waved at me.

103
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,640
He must remember me.

104
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,360
He will not let us go begging.

105
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,000
Again the little beast of yours...

106
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
You do it yourself!

107
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,080
- What have you done to her now?
- Nothing.

108
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,720
- Grandpa, can I come along?
- To the castle? No way.

109
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,640
You'd mess something up
and come to a bad end.

110
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,320
- I'd like to see Formina. - What for?

111
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,920
Maybe she'd dance with me.

112
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,520
You won't even get close to her.
If by chance you did,

113
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,760
Balador would burn your heels.

114
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,760
Come on!

115
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,840
Get up!

116
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,280
I'll finish you.

117
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,240
Loser! Loser!

118
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,040
Send for the healing mud.
My back was aching last night.

119
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,400
- Your husband is a weakling.
- I like him the way he is, Father.

120
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
Perun, to me.

121
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
Sit!

122
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,120
For you Formina, I've chosen
a better husband. Ostrik.

123
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,520
- But I don't wanna get married yet.
- First the betrothal...

124
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,960
- will take place. On your birthday.
- But that is tomorrow!

125
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:26,360
So what? I've prepared everything.
It will be your great day.

126
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,880
- Have I ever seen Ostrik?
- Of course, my dear.

127
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
On the day we signed
the wedding agreement.

128
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,160
- When was that? - You were two years old.
Ostrik was four then.

129
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,520
He stuck his tongue out at you,
and you hit him with a silver spoon.

130
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,160
- Hasn't he got a bump on his head?
- Not any more. Now come with me...

131
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm giving Ostrik the young bay
as a wedding gift. And also...

132
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,360
- this falcon. - Is this the one which
saved King Mathew? - No.

133
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,960
That one wears a golden crest.
Once I saw him by the Rocks.

134
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,600
- I've offered my castle on the Danube
for him. - Is he worth so much?

135
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:31,240
- For me he is. He is indeed the king
of all falcons. The pigeon! - My lord.

136
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,800
- Feed him! - No. I can't do that.

137
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,160
Do you want to offend me?

138
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,280
- But your old falconer...
- You remember Vagan? - Of course I do.

139
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,400
I liked him.

140
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,520
He told me falcons get a pigeon
only after hunting.

141
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,040
You're right.
We shouldn't spoil him.

142
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,600
- And where has Vagan gone?
- I don't know. He left. Was proud.

143
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,920
Once I insulted him... I'm sorry I did.

144
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,720
But lver will replace him.
He's already trained this falcon.

145
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,000
Leave your presents
by the servants in the yard.

146
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Our gracious Lady Formina
thanks you from her heart.

147
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,760
They won't let us in,
we have brought no presents.

148
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,200
Grandpa... Come on.

149
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,680
You wanna get into the castle?

150
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,560
Fine, come along.

151
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,960
- Why are you sitting here?
- Getting warm in the sun, you idiot.

152
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
- Get lost or they'll put you next to me.
- What have you done?

153
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,920
I broke a jug, that's all.

154
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,720
To the stocks for a jug?
Who ordered that?

155
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,520
- What do you think? Our lord of the castle.
- This Balador is really...

156
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,880
What did I tell you?
It is His Highness Lord Balador.

157
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
We have to go to the main courtyard.
His lorship won't come here.

158
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,320
- We want to congratulate the young lady...
- On behalf of the guild...

159
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,000
The presents are being listed by the clerk.
Over there.

160
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,160
Nobody can go any further.
We are expecting noble guests.

161
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,280
- You're Metod from the pastures,
aren't you? - And you're...

162
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,840
- Iver. The second coachman.
- Not any more.

163
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,240
- Now I'm Lord Balador's falconer.
- A falconer? You?

164
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,760
- What do you want here?
- We've come with a request to Lord Balador.

165
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,640
- This is my grandson, Thomas.
- Maybe I could arrange something...

166
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,440
- But he stays here. Come with me.
- Don't you dare move an inch.

167
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,120
According to the law, the convict
will get twenty strokes.

168
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,440
This is the ruling of the judge!
Executioner, do your business!

169
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,040
Bite him!

170
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,120
- What's up? What's going on here?
- Something is biting me!

171
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,120
Cane him! What's the matter with you?
Are you having a fit, man?

172
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,640
- Something's biting me!
- Run!

173
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,120
- Stop it! What do think you're doing?
- Catch him!

174
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,720
You idiot!

175
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,400
Guards! Catch him!

176
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,800
Well done.

177
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Come on, Sis.

178
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,280
I've got something for you.

179
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,200
From Stephen and me for your birthday.

180
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,120
May it bring happiness into your marriage
as it has to mine.

181
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,080
- You want some? - You bet!

182
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,920
When the bell up there
rings this leg is yours.

183
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,800
- And when will it ring?
- It hasn't rung for years. Has no clapper.

184
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,120
He won't get away with that.

185
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm here.

186
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,720
Rogues have all the luck.

187
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,520
- Here you are. - Thanks.

188
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,320
Make way for the cortege
of His Highness Count Donat!

189
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
Smile!

190
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,800
- What a dashing young man.
- By far and wide the best suitor.

191
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,520
- How handsome he is.
- I'd like one just like him.

192
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,160
- A fine bridegroom for Formina.
- Do you know her? Formina?

193
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,640
Of course I do.
I bring the mud to the castle.

194
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,760
This? For Formina?
And what does she do with it?

195
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,240
My brother takes care of the kennel.
And this is Perun.

196
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,200
- The best of Balador's dogs. - Quiet, Perun!
- Search him! Quickly!

197
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,120
Move!

198
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,080
Nothing else?

199
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,760
You want to rob this poor soul?

200
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,440
What if he's bringing a message from Vagan?
He is spreading rumours

201
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:13,280
- I stole his falcon.
- You can't compare with him!

202
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,440
You drove him away,
you good-for-nothing! Swindler!

203
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,320
You see? He's Vagan's spy!
Careful with me, old man.

204
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,960
Allow us to offer a few birthday
presents to the future bride.

205
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:50,600
And now our son wants personally give
this diadem to his fiancé

206
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,280
which she will soon wear
on her wedding veil.

207
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,880
Go on.

208
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,680
Thank you.

209
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,240
Looks good...

210
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,080
A little heavy.

211
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,440
I meant Ostrik.

212
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,760
On acount of my dear daughter
I thank you for the beautiful gifts.

213
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,160
And now, friends, to the table!

214
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,280
It is a healing mud. It takes away fever,
protects against the plague

215
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,280
and refreshes one's mind.
I know a fine lord who sips it like soup.

216
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,520
To clean his bowels...

217
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,520
- But Lord Balador heats it up and sits
in it up to his neck for hours.

218
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,080
- And Formina, too?
- No. She is as sound as a bell.

219
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,960
To us! We've been good fathers,
we'll also be good fathers-in-law.

220
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,920
To the bottom!

221
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,520
Hey, that's enough!

222
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,480
- You've promised we'll dance.
- I nearly forgot. Music!

223
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,480
Go and ask Formina to dance.
Everyone is waiting...

224
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,640
- But I... - It is your duty.

225
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,480
He's coming.

226
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,720
May I have the pleasure...

227
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm not the best dancer but...

228
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,360
- duty is duty!
- Duty? I thought you came voluntarily.

229
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,760
- Yes, of course, but you haven't
finished eating... - Oh, no.

230
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,080
I'm not going to eat any more.

231
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,040
Would you believe
I once hit you with such a spoon?

232
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Well, would you excuse me...

233
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,360
Have you seen that?

234
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,400
You were great.

235
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,040
- What happened?
- She is beautiful. - And?

236
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,320
- She wanted to hit me with a spoon.
- It's a pity she didn't.

237
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,760
I would burn my hands...

238
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,360
- What is your business here?
- I am here to dance with Formina.

239
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,920
You'll have to wait a long time.
I must wait until the gentry depart.

240
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,080
- I can see why. The stuff stinks.
- It has to stink in order to heal!

241
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,480
My mud...

242
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,640
What are you up to?

243
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,080
- What do you want here?
- You're Formina?

244
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,440
I've come to congratulate you.
It's my birthday today as well!

245
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,160
- You're not lying? - I swear it!

246
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,600
Do something!

247
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,400
So let's dance together.

248
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,080
Music!

249
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,000
Take my hand!

250
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,320
The mud heals...

251
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
Shall we jump like frogs?

252
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,080
That's enough!

253
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,960
- Who are you? - Thomas.

254
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
- You're forgetting something.
- Thomas, my lord,

255
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,920
the son of your herdsman
who was killed by the wolves.

256
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,840
We came here with a plea
for a piece of field... my lord.

257
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,960
- But you've spoilt my daughter's celebration
and for that... - No!

258
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,400
I wanted to dance and he fulfilled
my wish! And you said this would be...

259
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,600
- my great day! - I did say that.
But this is not what I meant.

260
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,920
Let the fortune decide.

261
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,720
A rose, a nice piece of land is yours.

262
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,560
An empty hand, you will get caned.

263
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,720
Now make your choice.

264
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,960
Rogues have all the luck!
The clerk will arrange it for you.

265
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,560
Now off, I don't wanna see your face
any more! Music!

266
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,200
- My friends... - Bravo!
- Eat, drink and be merry!

267
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,760
- Would you dance with me, my lady?
- With pleasure.

268
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,600
Grandpa?

269
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,520
Thomas. What are you wearing?

270
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,840
We got a piece of land from lord Balador.

271
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,440
- I've earned it by dancing with Formina!
- What?

272
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,920
It must have been a bewitched day.

273
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,760
You fly high... but it was me
who danced with Formina!

274
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
There he is! Get him!

275
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,960
- I can see him! - Halt!

276
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,640
- Leave him alone! - Let Perun off!

277
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,760
No!

278
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,000
Perun, get him!

279
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,040
Come on!

280
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,120
Be a good boy, Perun.

281
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,680
Perun, catch him!

282
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,320
Can't you hear, get him!

283
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,560
What has he done with the dog?

284
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,200
You little brat! You'll be sorry for that.

285
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,760
- Enough! Take him away.
- Quiet, come on...

286
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,640
What's wrong with him?

287
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,160
We were training Perun to track
and we ran into this boy

288
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,480
who danced with Lady Formina.
He did that, it's his work.

289
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,600
Such a dog is useless.

290
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
- Kill him. - No!

291
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,080
- Give him to me. - Take the carcass away.

292
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,560
As for this Thomas, now I'm gonna make him dance!

293
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Where have you been wandering?

294
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,280
Grandpa, does it hurt when you get caned?

295
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,680
It does.

296
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,880
I still have one...

297
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,320
And how many strokes would one get
if he'd done any harm to Perun?

298
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,480
Not a stroke.

299
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,560
Balador would roast him alive.

300
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,040
- Calm down, little one. - Hold it.

301
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,080
Take care of Agatha.

302
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,040
Come on.

303
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,280
Just one more thing. Come on.

304
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,800
We've come for your grandson.

305
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,520
- Thomas didn't steal the clothes.
- What clothes?

306
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,720
He bewitched his lordship's Perun.

307
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,680
- He's not in there. - Search the whole place!

308
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,400
Wait here.

309
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Well, what do you say?
Have you ever seen a prettier girl?

310
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,320
You're right. Me neither.

311
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,440
So let's go.

312
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,960
What are you doing here?
You've come to rob nests, huh?

313
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,600
- I don't steal! - Has perhaps Lord Balador
given you his best stud?

314
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,040
- Out with the truth.
- I turned his Perun into a harmless puppy.

315
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,640
He's sent the constables after me.
And so I took off on his bay.

316
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,000
You've heard that, Tatar?
He turned Perun into a puppy,

317
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,280
stole the bay and
the constables are after him.

318
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,640
We've caught a famous bandit!
We'll take his skin off

319
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,680
and send it to Balador. He will pay us well.

320
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,120
- Welcome to the Rocks. I'm Vagan.
- Balador's head falconer.

321
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,160
Used to be. Someone slandered me
that I am no longer able

322
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,920
- to train a falcon. - I know all about you.
- Who told you?

323
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,400
The birds.

324
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,760
Let's go.

325
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,960
Get down. We're home.

326
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,720
We'd better hide him. Go on in.

327
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:53,120
What's up? Leave me alone!
That hurts! Let me go!

328
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,960
Zubor! Leave him, he's our guest.

329
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,360
I found him begging by the castle.
Someone had cut out his tongue,

330
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,040
- afraid he might talk... - Lunch is ready!

331
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,440
Vince!

332
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,280
Long time no see, huh?! Come on in!

333
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,840
- Iver would've hunted me down
like an animal. - You cook for Vagan?

334
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,920
I've been promoted.
At the castle I took out the rubbish.

335
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,640
Here you go.

336
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,480
- Leave it. It's for Frankie.
- Who's Frankie? - You'll see.

337
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,000
- The constables! They've found me.
- And me, too!
