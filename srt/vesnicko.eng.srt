5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,116
You're trotting about like goat.

6
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,589
Missed it up again, doctor?

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,398
- Like hell I have.

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,918
- Finished - start her up.

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,035
- Thanks.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,554
Good morning.

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,356
Let's start feet together,
arms extended,

12
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,232
palms up.

13
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,194
Raise you arms...
- Washed your feet?

14
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,076
I can tell.
Makes a difference for the driver.

15
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,399
What about the ears?

16
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,752
You always forget something.

17
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,799
Those sails must not be neglected.

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,192
Yesterday's load was cement.

19
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,079
If it rains,
concrete'll set behind you ears.

20
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,637
They'll have to chisel it off.

21
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,150
You should've been born a horse.

22
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,070
But the Lord changed his mind.

23
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,589
Beneath him the beautiful distant places
lie,

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,629
round which the mountains darkly rise.

25
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,954
By woods encircled all around.

26
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,791
Amidst the flower-spattered ground.
The bright lake sleeps in slumber sound.

27
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,679
The waters rippling
to its shores're striving to meet.

28
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,029
Until at last
they marge in one luminous sheet.

29
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,069
Only the turtle-dove does not coo forth
its call to love anymore.

30
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,151
Don't shit yourself, cardboard dude!

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,673
Take these for your ears.

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,670
If you wear them, the ears'll stick
to your head beautifully.

33
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,877
A pine grove rustles on the lake's
still shore,

34
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,109
Whence glorious psalm of speckled thrush
ascends.

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,115
A portly tree stands on the rock -
an old eak.

36
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,993
Through the green vale scattering
the blossoms white,

37
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,551
Guding the wild geese over the woods
in flight.

38
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,272
Aren't you cold?

39
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,073
- I am, but nobody wants to warm me up.

40
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,312
- Why dodn't you say something?
- You're a right one, eh?

41
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,558
You're all smoke and no fire.
See you.

42
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,318
Living it up, eh?

43
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,193
- I wish!
My wife had a boy yesterday.

44
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,477
We celebrated a little.

45
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,359
- Are redheads celebrated too?
I'm surprised.

46
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,595
- What's up?
- A little celebration.

47
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,275
Celebrate, with your work!

48
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,353
- Your mate!

49
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,231
- I didn't see him over there.

50
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
- Look at him!
Look at the nitwit!

51
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,078
That... that...
If it was stone, you'd've been dead!

52
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,832
You...
An animal has more brains!

53
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,319
You oaf!

54
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,558
Gone's the furor of that Age
which Time bore far away.

55
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,989
Far-far off even its dream -
as a shadow did it fade,

56
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,475
As the image of white citiens
in the waters'depths arrayed,

57
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,556
As the last thoughts of the dead,

58
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,349
The names that once they bore,
The roll and roar of battle...

59
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,513
That's all I remember.

60
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,150
Feasting on the beauty again, eh?

61
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,231
- I wonder of she has brakes at all?

62
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,753
- Get the rope.

63
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,318
The rope!

64
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,674
You'll come to a bad end, doctor.

65
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,752
- We all will.

66
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,158
The gate-post was one week old.

67
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,359
It cost me 500.

68
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm through with Rakosnik.
Take it from me -

69
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,232
Iet someone else have the pleasure.

70
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,630
- I know it's not easy for you.

71
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,836
But who should I entrust him to?
- I don't care!

72
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,712
I've had this millstone around my neck
for 5 years!

73
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,832
A saint youldn't put up with it!
- I know how you feel.

74
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,275
But who should I entrust him to?
Duda's too young.

75
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,351
Duda's too young.
Can I entrust him

76
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,756
to your husband?
- He'd kill him.

77
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,233
He's terribly badtempered.

78
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,192
- It'd serve him right!
- Have you really

79
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,908
flattened the Prague weekender'fence?

80
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,633
- Come on...

81
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,869
You know that...
The boy needs a father's touch.

82
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,555
You've got it.

83
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,395
You can handle him
and he listens to you.

84
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,114
- Nothing doing -
let me have Sestak back.

85
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,557
A moron too, but at least he can sing.

86
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,071
Nobody's truck's as clean as yours.

87
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,872
You can't take that away from Otik.

88
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,036
- Till the hervest's over,
not a minute longer.

89
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,833
There you are.

90
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,834
Here I am.
Been waiting long?

91
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,633
They delivered the meat.

92
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,149
- Who gave them to you?
- Mr. Pavek.

93
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,236
They say he was mad with rage.

94
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,875
He doesn't want you anymore.

95
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,270
The'll hand you over to someone else.

96
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,114
He was fuming.

97
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,348
You'll be Turek's mate - I guess.

98
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,519
You' Il have a hard time!
I've brought you some shirts and socks.

99
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,557
You've nothing to wear.

100
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,955
And don't think,
Turek's not going to baby you.

101
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,875
You know.

102
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,637
I'll bring the rest tomorrow -
was too busy to wash them.

103
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,794
Turek's been known to hit his mates.

104
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,879
What's this?
Where's it from?

105
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,673
Come here, Otik!

106
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,276
Did you have woman here?

107
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,513
Come on.

108
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,234
Come.
Swear -

109
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,918
by the picture of your poor late
parents: Did you have woman here?

110
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,711
Look into my eyes:
Yes or no?

111
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,872
O.K., let's go and wash up.

112
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,752
Don't go into the front parlour
too often - it gets untidy easily.

113
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,669
Clear the mess of the table yourself,
after we've washed up.

114
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,395
Why don't you take off this finery?

115
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,152
Let me do it for you.

116
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,955
That's better.

117
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,468
C'mon -

118
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,352
I haven't got much time.

119
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,599
Come on.

120
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,114
A man, and he can't break
a pigeon's neck.

121
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,713
And a pigeon breeder to boot!

122
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,029
Dash it, I forgot
what I wanted to tell you!

123
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,429
It can wait though, I'll tel you later.

124
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,475
The laundry's done.
I'll bring the bedclothes afterwards.

125
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,354
The rabbit and dumplings're in the oven.

126
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,111
Warm them up properly.

127
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,430
Otik!
A superb film - Rumanian.

128
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,079
Have you got a ticket?
No.

129
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,434
You must see it.

130
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,397
Where have I...?
Here.

131
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,393
Good thing I've bought it for you.
Don't miss the newsreel.

132
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,436
Put you suit on, quick.
Let's go.

133
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,789
It's partly travel,
partly erotic.

134
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,836
I'd like to see it once more,

135
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,718
but I must go to a lecture on livestock
instead.

136
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,476
My old box's out of order.

137
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,038
A bad tube, I guess.

138
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,232
Otas!
In no case leave before the film's over!

139
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,158
The end's the best.

140
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,279
Enjoy yourself.

141
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,958
Mrs. Hruskova!
Mrs. Hruskova!

142
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,793
What's it like?

143
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,232
- They nearly cancelled it.

144
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,875
All told, I sold six tickets.

145
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,355
- Jo?
Aha.

146
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,313
Bye then.

147
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,633
What am I picking?
- Nettles, for the Easter stuffing.

148
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,472
- But I don't use that much.

149
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,673
- Is the film showing?

150
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,633
- Yes, but it was nearly cancelled.
- How come?

151
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,234
I myself sent six people.
- They all came.

152
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,355
Vasku.

153
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,995
This'll give me herpes again.
- You beast!

154
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,035
- I couldn't wait to be with you...

155
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,708
Don't be scared, Sonia.
Don't worry.

156
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,750
Just have a bang, Eugene!

157
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,551
- Mind you graves, raven.

158
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,318
Driving forward's easy,
but you got to have a knack for backing.

159
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,238
- Dinner's ready, Dad.

160
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,353
Dad, they say
you bumped into Mr. Rumlena's gate-post.

161
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,314
It isn's true, is it?
- Just eat and mind your own business.

162
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,471
Can't eat with all this singing.

163
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,071
Isn't it enough
to live next to the cemetery?

164
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,239
Of you can't sing anything else,
at least cut it out while we eat.

165
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,113
It's like chewing wreaths.

166
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,598
- Actually,
it's quite a wreck.

167
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,473
We went to look.

168
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,279
- So what?

169
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,673
So what?

170
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,319
- Good evening -

171
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,039
night, rather.

172
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,909
- Goodbye.
Well, see you.

173
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,473
Tuesday at nine then.
- Yes.

174
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,073
Let's go!
- Good night.

175
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,395
- Bring the rum.
- Sure.

176
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,079
- Why the rush?

177
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,959
- It's a PTA meeting tonight.

178
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,357
You must go, I can't.

179
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,115
Didn't get my hair done.
- To school?

180
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,277
- You go...

181
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
- I don't mind going.

182
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,510
They should all have their own towels.

183
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,069
Keep an eye on their homework.

184
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,992
That's all for now, thank you.

185
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,629
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

186
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,234
Make sure they dress properly.

187
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,910
Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied.
Good-bye.

188
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,119
- Good-bye.

189
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,832
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

190
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,753
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

191
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,039
What's the matter?

192
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,796
- What about her writing.
- All right.

193
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,231
It's neat.
- I see.

194
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,709
Gotta any problems?
- Got.

195
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,990
She has problems with pronouns.
Practise them with her.

196
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,952
Personal pronouns in particular.

197
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,431
- Pronouns in particular.
- I see.

198
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,633
Thanks then.

199
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,357
How d'you like it here?

200
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,312
- Quite, I hope I'll get used...

201
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,155
- What's keeping you?
- I'm just going.

202
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,798
- When'll the next PTA meeting be?

203
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,913
- In 3 months.

204
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,715
- Hm.

205
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,231
Good-bye then.
- Good-bye.

206
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,477
They say you ruined
the wekender's gate-post.

207
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,439
Is it true?

208
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,555
- Gate-post?
The whole shed, including the roof!

209
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,432
- Good Lord!

210
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,037
I've no mate, man.

211
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,958
He's either on strike,
or has hanged himself.

212
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,833
Shut up, you beast!

213
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,878
Otik, get up.

214
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,992
You_l have lovely ears, but no money.

215
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,156
Get up, we're going for cement.

216
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,070
Water levels:
Brandys nad Labem 146/60,

217
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,949
Melnik 252/115,

218
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,114
Usti nad Labem 180/144,

219
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,228
Decin 175/171,

220
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,873
Orlice-Tyniste nad Orlici 92/10.

221
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,070
Still waiting for you to warm me up.

222
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,557
- It'll happen one day.

223
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,714
Don't eavesdrop - you a spy or what?

224
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,918
Don't forget the meeting.

225
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,957
- Will you watch my back for me?

226
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,756
- What's your mate good for?
- Nothing.

227
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,271
- Put it here.
- No jo.

228
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,312
- You brought fodder?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,478
- From Kolin?
- Yeah.

230
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,718
- A mix?
- Yeah.

231
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,319
NO SMOKING

232
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,589
That's not very clever.
- What?

233
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,033
- Putting used matches
back into the box.

234
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,518
- Why?
- You'll see one day.

235
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,713
Mr. Pavek,

236
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,630
I don't want to work with Turek.

237
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,958
- You didn't appreciate me.

238
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,358
When the harvest's over,
you'll join Turek.

239
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,951
- Me?
When the rake starts flowering.

240
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,470
- Take a look at it at home.
It may be budding.

241
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,353
- When the harvest's over, it's Turek.

242
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,239
What is it, Otik?

243
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,438
Look - Otik brought you this.

244
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,917
He likes you, poor thing.

245
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,512
He doesn't know how to tell you.

246
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,756
You should forgive him.

247
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,149
When the pressure falls before a storm,
I feel wiped out.

248
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,158
- So do I - what's next?

249
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,516
- Varicose veins.

250
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,912
- Look at mine.

251
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,553
- D'you wear elastic stockings?
- I do.

252
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,036
- D'you take Anavenol?
- I do.

253
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,118
- That's it then.
Go on.

254
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,513
- I'm serving beer.

255
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,515
Someone asks for the bill.

256
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,914
I turn my head and it won't go back.

257
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,230
- Can you turn the whole body,
like this?

258
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,511
- Sure.
- Turn the whole body then.

259
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,159
Go on.

260
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,633
- I can't sleep.

261
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,640
I wake up at four
and I can't go back to sleep.

262
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,157
- Commonplace at this age.
I'm wakeful from half past three.

263
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,673
What's next?

264
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,555
- My joints.
Sometimes I can hardly get up.

265
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,598
- But you do?
- In the end, because, I have to.

266
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,360
- Why complain then?
There're people who can't at all.

267
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,916
- Doctor, you make light of everything.

268
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,152
I know best how I feel.
I'm not going to be here much longer.

269
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,792
- D'you want spa treatment?

270
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,314
- No, it didn't do me any good.

271
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,595
- Close down the pub
and go to the sea then.

272
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,518
- I went the year before last.
It gives me the runs.

273
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,473
- Go to the High Tatra then.
- I can't stand heights.

274
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,639
- You know where to go then?

275
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,474
Go to Pelhrimov
and have a look at the cramtorium -

276
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,551
so you know what it's like there.

277
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,917
Yeah?
Next!

278
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,199
Dear comrade, with reference
to the demanding plan targets...

279
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,799
- A lovely ship!

280
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,913
Where did you get if from?
- The boy made it.

281
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,512
...in the interest
of producer-end-user relations,

282
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,710
our organization needs a driver's mate.

283
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,072
- Your Honza?
- Ships're his hobby.

284
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,670
We'd like to make use of the extensive
experience of your employee,

285
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,512
comrade Rakosnik.

286
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,431
We have offered him a company flat
on a housing estate in Prague

287
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,398
and he has accepted.

288
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,069
METALWOOD, perschnel dept., Koutna.

289
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,079
- Expect Otik going to Prague

290
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,273
to save the producer-end-user-relations?

291
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,277
- Something like it.
What have you to say?

292
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,269
- Me - I'm through with him.

293
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,833
What is there for me to say?

294
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,355
- That's just it.
- What's just it?

295
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,069
- Can you imagine the boy
going to Prague?

296
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,191
Can you just imagine it?

297
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,431
He gets lost in the streets.

298
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,355
All the houses're the same
on the housing estate.

299
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,513
No one to turn to.

300
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,394
That match's not a good idea, Jaromir!

301
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,157
Terrible to think of our Otik stopping
Prague traffic.

302
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,035
to let a truck back in somewhere.

303
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,038
- I prefer not to.

304
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,632
- This letter...

305
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,590
This is the last time you to this!

306
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,148
tohle bylo naposledy.
What's the big idea?

307
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,909
That I'd be carrying on with her,
at my age?

308
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,158
Another raid like this and you're fired!

309
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,398
This'll give me a stroke!
Co je?

310
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,115
- Just came in to ask who'll pick
the kid up from kindergarten.

311
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,079
- Granny, as always.

312
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,713
- That's what I wanted to know.

313
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,078
- He needs treatment.

314
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,433
That's not normal.

315
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,439
- Sorry.

316
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,232
- This letter did not write itself.

317
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,677
Sure - someone must've written it.
- That's just it.

318
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,515
- You look as if I'd written it myself.

319
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,476
- You didn't - some Koutna woman
wrote it, personnel dept.

320
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,513
But someone must've told them
about Otik, eh?

321
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,360
With my common sense,
it's easy to work out

322
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,715
- Now I see,
- who in this village'd benefit...

323
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,588
- I see.
You think then I fixed it up in Prague...

324
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,910
- I didn't say that.
I'm just asking.

325
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,716
- For 5 years, I've been chained to him.

326
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,033
Taught him to use knife and fork,

327
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,949
to wash, so that he wouldn't fall
under my wheels.

328
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,313
...Iike he was my own son...

329
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,710
...now they'll suspect me!

330
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,831
Don't take it too seriously, dad.
- Cut it out!

331
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,954
Dancing - when a funeral's on!
Get down!

332
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,717
- Silence please - a funeral's on!

333
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,229
- Mind your business - graveyrad bully!

334
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,631
You're behaving like a ruffion.

335
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,116
Good morning, doctor.

336
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,119
How convenient
to live by the burial pit, eh?

337
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,513
- 'morning.

338
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,750
- Shine on me the sun...

339
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,633
- And music as well!

340
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,469
The boy'll perish in Prague
within a week.

341
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,755
It's either a crazy idea, or a set-up.

342
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,194
What's it look like on the 7th step?

343
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,229
- They're there.
- How are you?

344
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,397
- Fine, but from the dizziness.

345
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,913
- As you get up?
- Yes.

346
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,713
In the morning, sit up in bed first,
stay like that for some time,

347
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,952
get up carefully.
- Ano.

348
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,151
- Have you still fot the pills?
- Yes.

349
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,235
- Fajn.

350
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,279
What gave you the idea that

351
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,238
the 7th step'd give it
the right temperature?

352
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,914
- Longterm trials.
It's warm on the 6th,

353
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,872
too cold on the 8th.
- I see.

354
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,116
- Karel likes experimenting, eh?

355
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,919
He's fond of trials.

356
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,840
- Good morning, doctor.
- 'morning.

357
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,037
- How did it go for him?
- He had a beautiful funeral.

358
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,599
Give me a drink, just a drop.

359
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,354
What a lovely day!
- It's so fresh!

360
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,834
Such moments should be remembered,

361
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,871
to fall back on.

362
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,595
To warm you up in winter.
- Look!

363
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,076
Such beauties're becoming rarer,
but there's still something left.

364
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,309
Some woodland, beer's good...
...sometimes...

365
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,673
- I'll fetch the plates.

366
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,599
- And the girls, Karel,

367
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,152
our girls're the most beautiful
in the world.

368
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,839
The Spanish or Italian women can't match
up - they mostly have goat-like legs.

369
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,318
Did you notice how many girls
walk about braless?

370
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,909
- I did.
- Nice fashion, eh?

371
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,956
- Yeah.

372
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,837
- I'm glad it's spread
as far as our village.

373
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,997
- This gravestone artist's a pain.
Fanda -

374
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,548
your diligence's getting on my nerves.

375
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,156
- Tool busy, doctor.

376
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,109
Many cadavers, few engravers.

377
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,710
- Come and wash away the dust.

378
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,638
Where did we leave off?
- That they walk about braless.

379
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,992
- Yeah, looks like
we're not going to conclude it.

380
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,272
- Anything special you're busy with?
- An interesting gravestone -

381
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,916
with no inscription.

382
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,476
It'll be added on when the person dies.

383
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,471
- Did he place an advance order
for a tomb?

384
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,755
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

385
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,958
- I mustn't tell.

386
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,272
- People don't know what to do
with money.

387
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,629
He's got a house, TV, car.
What is there I haven't got, he asks?

388
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,239
A tomb.

389
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,315
Hi.
- Hi.

390
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,435
- Hi.

391
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,269
Your guardian angel's having

392
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,191
a hell of a job.

393
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,236
- The madguard needs replacing, I guess?

394
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,720
- No use, unless you got a rubber one.

395
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,912
Jesus!

396
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,075
In days past,

397
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,235
Czechs were strong and steadfast,

398
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,836
In days past,

399
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,595
"they were, for the eyes, a repast."

400
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,633
Missing your old school?

401
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,838
- I've come to ask
how my sister's doing.

402
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,235
- I see. Going to sit
for your finals, aren't you?

403
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,436
- Yes.
- What'll you do afterwards?

404
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,437
- Go to a dung college, er -
School of Agriculture.

405
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,679
- I'll keep my fingers crossed for you -
don't let the side down!

406
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,074
- I drilled the pronouns with her -

407
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,510
was it any good, I wonder?

408
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,990
Like she din't botch up her dictation
again?

409
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,191
Shal I carry your bag?
- Yes.

410
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,671
Unusual - a brother so interested

411
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,273
in his sister's progress.

412
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,634
- Our parents're too busy.
It's up to me then.

413
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,954
- Hm.

414
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,199
- It's excercise-books, eh?

415
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,239
- Yes, exercise-books.

416
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,430
- What're you laughing at?
- Nothing.

417
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,318
How you're chatting me up through
your sister.

418
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,156
- I'm a nuisance, eh?
- Why?

419
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,356
You should concentrate on your studies
now -

420
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,392
and don't try to sweep older girls
off their feet.

421
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,718
Aunt, are there rooms to let?

422
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,313
- Are you my nephew?

423
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,557
Funny thing, I don't know you!
- Okay,

424
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,596
so how about some accommodation?

425
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,308
- The village's changed, young man.

426
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,915
We don't address each other
as Aunt and Uncle.

427
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,435
We use our first names
and 'comrade'instead.

428
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,597
I wouldn't insist on that.

429
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,712
The customs have changed, though.

430
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,351
Like when a man addresses a lady:

431
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,914
he stands up first and greets her.

432
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,119
- Okay then.

433
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,758
I wish you good morning.
Permit me to ask you:

434
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,229
what about some abode, ma'am?

435
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,958
- C'mon then.

436
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:30,907
- Do your customs allow a man to walk
behind a lady, or next to her?

437
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:33,787
- He may walk next to her,
of he can keep up.

438
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,827
Hi.
- Ahoj.

439
00:44:53,398 --> 00:44:54,831
- How's life?

440
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:56,751
- Not bad.

441
00:45:02,198 --> 00:45:03,631
- Yeah.
Oh, well.

442
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,513
Look where you're going,
or you'll trip up.

443
00:45:17,238 --> 00:45:19,149
- Take it easy.
- Shut up and clear off!

444
00:45:22,238 --> 00:45:23,671
Why're you out here with next
to nothing on?

445
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:27,557
- It's warm, isn't it?

446
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:30,069
- How come that milkso's so familiar?

447
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:32,076
- We've always been on first name terms!

448
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:35,317
- Interesting!
Where's the kid?

449
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:38,954
- With Granny.
- Interesting!

450
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,156
- You find everything interesting.

451
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:44,797
- I'm not a moron.

452
00:45:48,558 --> 00:45:49,991
- She always goes to Granny
from kindergarten.

453
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:51,875
You never found that interesting before.

454
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:55,868
If this goes on, I'll do the same.

455
00:45:55,998 --> 00:45:57,636
That'll make it even more interesting.

456
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:07,596
- Let's go for a swim.
It'll be empty now.

457
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,511
- I can't go into the water today.

458
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:12,950
- You can watch me then.

459
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:45,676
You time me.

460
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,956
Now!

461
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,717
- Jesus Vasek, don't be a fool!

462
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:14,947
Don't, Pepik's here!

463
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:40,869
Thirty-three!
- Too bad.

464
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:43,317
Go on!

465
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:51,588
- How long?
- About half a minute.

466
00:47:51,678 --> 00:47:54,511
Please, go away.
- We've plenty of time.

467
00:47:58,638 --> 00:48:00,071
- Just a carp.

468
00:48:03,918 --> 00:48:05,397
Thirty-seven!

469
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,317
- Not bad, eh?
D'you know how long Sestak can hold out?

470
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,431
Twenty-six, a non-smoker!

471
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:22,672
- I was wrong - thirty-one!

472
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:24,910
- Impossible!
- Thirty-one!

473
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:27,357
- Watch it, then!

474
00:48:32,038 --> 00:48:33,517
- Otik's place tonight, right?

475
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,755
- Forty-two!
- No!

476
00:48:42,598 --> 00:48:44,111
Fine!

477
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:54,273
I've changed the bedclothes for you.

478
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:58,267
It'll be like in a hotel.
- Thanks, lady.

479
00:48:59,078 --> 00:49:01,114
- He'll stay with Otik.

480
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:03,229
At least Otik'll not be so lonely.

481
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,033
It'll be for the better.

482
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:13,556
D'you have to paint the fence so shabby?

483
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:15,869
- You find it shabby?
- I told you

484
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,516
I was going to put in new planks.

485
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:19,515
This way, they look as if they were
in pieces.

486
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:21,475
- I paint them the way the are.

487
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,472
- Can't you imagine a repired fence?

488
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:28,190
- It looks better this way, doesn't it?
- What about the pealing plaster?

489
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:32,947
Is that supposed to look better?
- Don't meddle with it, Hrabetova!

490
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:35,309
What d'you charge for such a painting?

491
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:38,587
- Want to buy it?
- No,

492
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:40,996
I want you to paint my house.

493
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,551
- Which one is it?
- Over there.

494
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:50,628
- I couldn't cope with that one.

495
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,754
- If you can cope with an old ruin.

496
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:54,556
Why not with a decent house?

497
00:49:57,118 --> 00:49:58,437
If you want to paint the eaves true to
life,

498
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:00,429
I've got some green paint left over.

499
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:05,033
- I simply couldn't.
If I don't like something,

500
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:07,473
there's no way I can paint it.

501
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:10,471
- He likes our old ruins, doesn't he?

502
00:50:11,038 --> 00:50:13,268
- There're many things to my liking.

503
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:56,631
I'm not in charge of animals,
but paperwork.

504
00:50:57,518 --> 00:50:59,668
I'm a personnel manager for livestock.

505
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:02,996
I've a file on each calf:
its family background,

506
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:04,916
what sort of stud its father was,

507
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:06,795
what sort of cow its mother was.

508
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,313
- It was not our idea.

509
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:13,114
If they want it, just fill it in.

510
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:18,555
- I've been wandering about it -
I see it's yours.

511
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:22,347
- Thanks, where did you find it?
- You'd better not ask.

512
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:27,276
- Let's see about the letter
and go home.

513
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:29,708
- Tell them to get stuffed -
it's nonsense.

514
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,874
- Let's hear from Rakosnik.

515
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:33,671
- That means staying here till midnight.

516
00:51:34,038 --> 00:51:36,393
- Fetch him, please.

517
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:40,314
- Before she drags him
out of the cinema...

518
00:51:40,718 --> 00:51:42,470
- How d'you know he's there?

519
00:51:47,198 --> 00:51:51,157
This game is more cheaty

520
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:53,629
than the others.

521
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:56,877
- But, Mister, it was just fun,

522
00:51:57,358 --> 00:51:59,553
I've found more clever game.

523
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:03,514
Wanna know which one?
How about playing humans

524
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:05,630
going for a sunday swim?

525
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,193
- But how they'll get to the riverside?

526
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,029
You won't tell us who it was?

527
00:52:13,638 --> 00:52:16,152
- He knows nothing.
He was from Prague, wasn't he?

528
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:21,952
What did he tell you?
To go to work in Prague?

529
00:52:25,198 --> 00:52:26,631
What else did he tell you?

530
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,237
- Fifty-seven.

531
00:52:32,278 --> 00:52:33,711
- What d'you mean?

532
00:52:35,158 --> 00:52:37,626
- Cinemas - they have.

533
00:52:41,398 --> 00:52:42,956
- Listen, Otik -

534
00:52:47,238 --> 00:52:50,753
would you like to go to Prague?

535
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:00,231
You don't like your village -

536
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:03,198
so small, so beautiful?

537
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:07,310
And the little house you were born in?

538
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:16,551
The won't let you keep you pigeons -

539
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:19,671
they shit on their statues.
You don't mind that?

540
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:25,154
Go now.

541
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:28,357
- Bye.

542
00:53:34,118 --> 00:53:36,473
- You're making a big mistake -
you'll pay for it.

543
00:53:37,158 --> 00:53:38,113
- What's that again?

544
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:39,995
- Putting used matches back
into the box.

545
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:42,871
- There's no doubt -

546
00:53:43,598 --> 00:53:46,510
someone from Prague
wants Rakosnik's house.

547
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:48,351
I can tell you who -

548
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,549
this dauber sho's moved in there.

549
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:56,192
- D'you ever watch detective films
on TV?

550
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:57,757
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

551
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:01,068
Otherwise you couldn't say such a thing.

552
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:05,029
This noted painter got here
after the letter.

553
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,554
I fixed him up at Otik's place.

554
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:11,276
It was completely my doing.

555
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:14,630
Why I did this is another story.

556
00:54:15,238 --> 00:54:18,389
I think someone else wants the house.

557
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:21,229
Maybe he's among us here.

558
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,789
But you work it out yourselves.

559
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:27,150
- Thank you, Super, for your, analysis.

560
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:30,236
I suggest we reply the following:

561
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:32,468
Comrade Rakosnik is a moron.

562
00:54:32,678 --> 00:54:35,351
He has to be supervised
by an experienced worker.

563
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:37,828
His mental make-up's not up to living
in town.

564
00:54:37,998 --> 00:54:40,717
Also, he keeps pigeons,
which he couldn't in Prague.

565
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,471
Full stop.
- You can't write 'moron'.

566
00:54:43,998 --> 00:54:46,353
I'd write 'half-wit'
- The doctor said

567
00:54:46,438 --> 00:54:48,474
he was momentally backward.

568
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:51,750
- Mentally.
- Not bad - write it up.

569
00:55:00,438 --> 00:55:01,917
C'mon, it's starting.

570
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,792
- Have they had the mirror yet?
- Not yet.

571
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:07,467
- I'll join you when the mirror
comes on.

572
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,392
- The American film Harpoon mirrors
that we offer you,

573
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,910
the bourgeois society

574
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:18,555
where the dollar's
the alpha and omega of life.

575
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:21,518
It was made

576
00:55:21,878 --> 00:55:24,267
by Francis S. Jones in 1962.

577
00:55:28,398 --> 00:55:31,549
Manhattan, 27th September.

578
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:36,515
- Watching?
So, I won't bother you.

579
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:38,077
I'll come later then.

580
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:39,911
- Come on in.

581
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,471
- Where's your sister's body - tell us!

582
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:48,875
- If I don't tell you, I can't sleep.

583
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,631
- Say it and you'll sleep.

584
00:55:53,438 --> 00:55:57,556
- Could he leave, or shall we?

585
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:01,596
- Go and do some gluing.
He didn't want to watch anyway.

586
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,478
- Don't shoot until I tell you.

587
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:21,550
- They're meeting there - I saw them.

588
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:23,790
- Jana Turkovic?
- Yes, Jana Turkova.

589
00:56:24,558 --> 00:56:26,867
- It's all over New York.
Photographs in the newspapers.

590
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,952
- If it gets back to Turek,
he'll kill her.

591
00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:38,351
- Don't yell, idiot.

592
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,636
- Kaspar's a fool, too.

593
00:56:42,718 --> 00:56:44,310
She's the mother of a young child.

594
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,552
- Where's Bradley?
Where is he?

595
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,394
He should've been here long ago.

596
00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:54,947
- Don't wait for Bradley.
I'll take care of him.

597
00:56:56,398 --> 00:56:58,628
- How long have they been at it?
- God knows.

598
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,269
- What's this got to do with his house?

599
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:04,589
- Of you no gotta dollars,
man, you're in trouble.

600
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:08,075
- Exactly.
I think

601
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:11,270
he wants to pack him off to Prague

602
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:14,113
to fornicate in his house.

603
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:16,357
Or -

604
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:20,069
he wants it for a friend from Prague

605
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:22,554
who's only spend the weekends here

606
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:26,751
and the mice could play during the week.
- This woman's stoned.

607
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:30,429
- I don't think so.
It was his suggestion

608
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:31,951
not to let him go.

609
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:35,230
- It's a cover-up.

610
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:40,316
- I'm sorry for the kid,
if it comes to light.

611
00:57:40,598 --> 00:57:42,077
- Don't tell anybody!

612
00:57:46,398 --> 00:57:49,595
- Like the tomb!

613
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,594
- They killed Bradley!

614
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,437
Hey, wait, Charlie!

615
00:59:30,918 --> 00:59:33,478
He's been invited
by our comrade director.

616
00:59:33,558 --> 00:59:35,469
Follow me, please.
Thanks, Karel, you're very kind.

617
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:39,029
You'll like it here.
Nothing to be afraid of.

618
00:59:39,278 --> 00:59:41,314
All is managed.
Here's the personnel department.

619
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:44,868
But we'll go there later.
Let'go, there...

620
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,558
Good morning.
We'll go there afterwards.

621
00:59:50,358 --> 00:59:51,837
Wait.
Well, go on.

622
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:11,316
Comrade director,
it's comrade Rakosnik -

623
01:00:12,598 --> 01:00:14,077
the one with the house.

624
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:25,070
Will you take coffee or something
stronger?

625
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:26,831
- A vodka?

626
01:00:27,598 --> 01:00:29,953
What?
- A roll.

627
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:34,429
- A roll.

628
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:37,750
- Welcome, comrade Rakosnik.

629
01:00:38,278 --> 01:00:39,711
I hope...

630
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:43,354
...you'll like it here.

631
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:47,953
I'm pressed for time,

632
01:00:48,198 --> 01:00:50,348
you'll have to see to it yourself.
- Sure.

633
01:00:50,718 --> 01:00:52,071
- Want the car?
- Yes.

634
01:00:52,198 --> 01:00:53,597
- Take the car!
- Yes, thank's.

635
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:55,157
- See you then.

636
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:57,954
- C'mon, Otik.
Good-bye.

637
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:03,749
- Bad habit, hand-shaking.

638
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:07,873
They've long given it up in the West.

639
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:12,117
No wonder we have epidemics of flu here.

640
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:34,918
A shower - that's something, eh?

641
01:01:35,598 --> 01:01:37,873
Watch it now...
All right...

642
01:01:40,038 --> 01:01:43,792
They haven't turned it on yet...

643
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,594
Cold water, hot water.

644
01:01:47,758 --> 01:01:49,794
Now something you haven't seen yet.

645
01:01:53,158 --> 01:01:54,637
It's no like in your place.

646
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,314
Wait till you see the kitchen:

647
01:01:57,398 --> 01:02:00,037
hot and cold water, a sink,

648
01:02:00,118 --> 01:02:01,710
an elektric or gas cooker...

649
01:02:04,678 --> 01:02:07,351
C'mon, Otik.

650
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:11,431
A modern kitchen, what a marvel!

651
01:02:13,638 --> 01:02:17,392
Otiku, Otiku,
C'mon then.

652
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,717
Come on.

653
01:02:20,478 --> 01:02:22,434
This is...
Come here.

654
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,989
the latest fittings...
hot and cold water,

655
01:02:26,718 --> 01:02:28,436
extractor fan...

656
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,672
electric cooker...

657
01:02:33,558 --> 01:02:35,674
oven with grill!

658
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:39,917
What a height, eh?

659
01:02:42,198 --> 01:02:45,508
What's the matter?
What?

660
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,236
Pigeons?

661
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:54,071
Plenty of them - in the Old Town Square.

662
01:02:54,998 --> 01:02:57,558
It's not so bad, Frantisek.

663
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:03,593
- The moment he's better,
he'll smoke and drink again.

664
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:08,907
You should tell him not to.
He's more likely to listen to you.

665
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,628
- If he gave it up all at once,
it'd do no good.

666
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:16,430
The grave should receive
a decrepit body.

667
01:03:17,398 --> 01:03:20,993
You'll cut down, eh?

668
01:03:22,558 --> 01:03:24,435
A cuddly little thing, eh?

669
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:27,749
Very.

670
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:30,831
What's his name?
- He doesn't even have a name.

671
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:33,314
Dad found him at the railway station.

672
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:37,268
He adopted him and followed him
all the way home.

673
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:39,787
- That's a good doggy.

674
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,631
- If you like him, take him.

675
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:44,317
- I would't mind.

676
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:46,948
- Such a mongral?

677
01:03:47,678 --> 01:03:50,670
- They're the best.
Come here.

678
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:06,868
An accident with the combine harvester -
they've run over Drapalik.

679
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:20,153
Have a look, doctor, what a sight!

680
01:04:20,438 --> 01:04:23,748
He went uder the harvester -
- Yeah.

681
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:26,034
to have a look at the transmission box.

682
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,229
Turek backed into him...

683
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:30,548
We shouted:
"""There's a man there, you oaf!"","

684
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:33,235
but he rolled him over once more.

685
01:04:33,318 --> 01:04:34,751
You must see it, doctor...

686
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:36,556
You will see something, let's go.

687
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:48,270
- Where's he?
- Here.

688
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:56,832
- What's your opinion, doctor?
- Stand up.

689
01:05:00,518 --> 01:05:02,031
Walk about a bit.

690
01:05:04,598 --> 01:05:07,670
- Surprised, eh?
- How steely our people are, eh?

691
01:05:11,638 --> 01:05:13,071
- Impossible.

692
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:18,796
If you poured plaster into those,
he'd have a statue.

693
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:24,831
That'il do.

694
01:05:34,358 --> 01:05:35,791
Bend over.

695
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:42,157
Does it hurt?
- No.

696
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,437
- And this?

697
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:49,387
What's so funny?
- It tickles.

698
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:51,594
- Look, go home and come back tomorrow.
Come.

699
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:02,826
Turn up the sleeve.
Hold this.

700
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:08,426
- Is it necessary?
- If it weren't,

701
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:10,827
I wouldn't be doing it.
You think I enjoy it?

702
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:13,517
You had a few, eh?

703
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,671
Keep still then.

704
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,150
All right, that's it.

705
01:06:42,878 --> 01:06:44,516
What the hell's all this?

706
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:51,911
IMMORTAL DRAPALIK /PLASTER/

707
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:55,389
Keep shooting your mouths off

708
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,395
and we'll have the safety officer
breathing down our necks!

709
01:06:59,398 --> 01:07:01,548
No beer out in the fields anymore!

710
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:04,194
Turek, is that clear?

711
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,429
- Sure.
- How come I was not called

712
01:07:06,518 --> 01:07:07,951
in on the accident?

713
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:10,554
- I guess they didn't want
to wake you up -

714
01:07:10,638 --> 01:07:12,310
if nothing actually happened.

715
01:07:13,678 --> 01:07:15,908
- They say Turek was under
the influence.

716
01:07:16,918 --> 01:07:20,149
You were suppposed to take a blood test.
- I did.

717
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:24,277
He was not under the influence.

718
01:07:25,878 --> 01:07:27,709
He was lucky,

719
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,036
for I expect he'll lose his wife soon.

720
01:07:32,118 --> 01:07:35,349
If he lost his licence -
that's be

721
01:07:35,438 --> 01:07:36,871
too many blows at once.

722
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:46,507
- I've got my opinion of the matter.

723
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:49,517
- Suit yourself.

724
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,228
This is the surest sign of progress.

725
01:07:58,878 --> 01:08:00,948
- What is?
- The tinker always came

726
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:06,267
this time of year -
from Slovakia.

727
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:09,837
Today - we have Stefan!

728
01:08:10,558 --> 01:08:12,116
- Perhaps it will not be Stefan.

729
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:14,354
Maybe they'll send someone else.
- Hardly - but even if:

730
01:08:14,478 --> 01:08:17,868
but even if:
it's a sure sign of progress.

731
01:08:18,358 --> 01:08:20,747
- Can Stefan drink?
We've a bottle for him.

732
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:22,709
- You're crazy!

733
01:08:23,518 --> 01:08:25,509
- He'll get plastered and do a spiral.

734
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:27,557
- Who did this?

735
01:08:33,598 --> 01:08:35,031
You...

736
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:41,396
You lout!

737
01:08:42,558 --> 01:08:45,630
- Let him go,
or I'll take you to pieces!

738
01:08:47,278 --> 01:08:48,711
Let him be!

739
01:08:49,518 --> 01:08:50,951
- Come off it!
- You me?

740
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,437
- Ouch, you oaf!

741
01:09:17,918 --> 01:09:20,637
- Come off it, boys!

742
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:23,193
There's no point in it!

743
01:09:23,758 --> 01:09:25,988
Calling yourselves cooperative farmers?

744
01:09:28,078 --> 01:09:30,990
What is it?
- Stefan.

745
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:47,673
- Beat it, boys!

746
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:53,831
Stefan!

747
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:28,433
Hi, boys, how's life?

748
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:32,711
- Fine.

749
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:05,798
Reserved for redheands!

750
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:38,593
You can cover up adultery in town.

751
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:40,671
Not here.

752
01:11:41,678 --> 01:11:43,157
Unfortunately.

753
01:11:43,638 --> 01:11:45,594
- Does it affect the milk yield?

754
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,914
- What d'you mean?
- If not,

755
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:49,556
then it's my private business.

756
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,629
- It is and it isn't.

757
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:55,395
The morals of the village're
totally different.

758
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,911
- And what are they?

759
01:11:57,998 --> 01:11:59,989
- Unspoilt.
- Aha.

760
01:12:17,518 --> 01:12:18,951
Whose dog is it, doctor?

761
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,550
- Mine -
it was strandel at the railway station.

762
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:23,956
- A mixed bread, eh?

763
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:26,911
- What's its name?

764
01:12:27,158 --> 01:12:29,513
- Lord Charles of the Railway Station.

765
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,437
You drinking?

766
01:13:05,118 --> 01:13:06,631
That's all right then.

767
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:10,274
Leave it at that, or you'll be sick.

768
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:33,472
Going to live in Prague?

769
01:13:34,198 --> 01:13:35,631
- When the harvest's over.

770
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,556
- You're a great guy.

771
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,476
I like you.
No.

772
01:13:52,198 --> 01:13:54,792
Try that again and we'll have it out
in the backyard.

773
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:10,756
Don't pour the beer out the window!

774
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,317
Look at me now!

775
01:14:12,638 --> 01:14:15,311
What fun,

776
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:16,831
pouring beer out the window!

777
01:14:17,678 --> 01:14:19,157
Hi, Stefan.

778
01:14:56,278 --> 01:14:58,508
You've a lovely face,

779
01:14:58,838 --> 01:15:01,750
but I like your -
er, the bottom of your pan the best

780
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:05,032
- Aren't you a lecher, doctor!

781
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:07,913
- A pan's a frying utensil.

782
01:15:07,998 --> 01:15:09,590
You should know that.

783
01:15:12,278 --> 01:15:14,155
But the other one's lovely too.

784
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:26,790
D'you like being taken over by him?

785
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:30,746
- Your sister wrote the best dictation.

786
01:15:33,318 --> 01:15:34,273
What?

787
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:39,191
- Red cabbage!
- I can't hear you!

788
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:41,433
- A cabbage head...

789
01:15:46,518 --> 01:15:48,429
Thinks if he's an artist
he can mess around.

790
01:15:49,558 --> 01:15:50,991
Tell him your foot hurts.
- What?

791
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:52,636
What?
- To tell him,

792
01:15:52,718 --> 01:15:54,674
your leg aches!
He'll leave you alone, the scum.

793
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,316
- Her behaviour's excellent, too.

794
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:57,831
Much better than her brother's.

795
01:15:58,198 --> 01:15:59,870
She doesn't say 'mess around'or acum'.

796
01:16:13,598 --> 01:16:16,396
When he clears off,
you'll come crawling.

797
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:18,474
I may not be interested then.

798
01:16:18,878 --> 01:16:20,834
- And she doesn't use blackmail.

799
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:08,468
I won it for you.

800
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:11,348
- How nice!
- Cherish it -

801
01:17:12,398 --> 01:17:13,956
it cost me fifty-two crowns.

802
01:17:16,358 --> 01:17:19,350
- Good evening, Mr. Kalina.
- Good evening.

803
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:24,707
My wife told me your son wants to go
to the naval college.

804
01:17:24,798 --> 01:17:27,437
- He's set on it.

805
01:17:27,638 --> 01:17:30,436
- Just say,
if you need a good word put in.

806
01:17:30,518 --> 01:17:32,713
Our director could be quite helpful.

807
01:17:33,678 --> 01:17:36,795
- That's be fine -
there seems to be a rush of applicants.

808
01:17:37,558 --> 01:17:39,674
- Let's have a word with him
when he comes.

809
01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:41,635
I discovered a house for him here, see?

810
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:45,069
- In our village?
- Rakosnik's place.

811
01:17:45,438 --> 01:17:47,156
- Otik's?
- Otik.

812
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,511
- I see.

813
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:56,868
Where from?
- From Zvolen.

814
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:59,953
I got married here and settled down.

815
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,150
- Were Slovak girls no good?

816
01:18:03,398 --> 01:18:05,275
- The usual story:
I did my National Service here.

817
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:07,826
No the marrying type, I got involved,

818
01:18:07,918 --> 01:18:09,431
couldn't back put.

819
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:12,991
- He seems to have problems
with backing, eh?

820
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:16,229
- Not a good idea, that match.

821
01:18:16,318 --> 01:18:19,867
It'll backfire one day.
- Take it easy.

822
01:18:29,598 --> 01:18:31,554
All right?

823
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:35,473
Don't go to Prague, it's better here.

824
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:38,715
- I must, when the harvest's over.
- Why -

825
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,390
what's wrong with this place?

826
01:18:41,078 --> 01:18:44,514
- Mr. Pavek said
when the harvest was over.

827
01:19:09,998 --> 01:19:11,477
That's it!

828
01:19:25,598 --> 01:19:27,429
Where you been?
- What's that to do with you?

829
01:19:27,678 --> 01:19:29,157
- Shut up and come here!

830
01:19:33,438 --> 01:19:37,556
- Boys - leave me in peace
on Sunday at least.

831
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:41,430
- No decent pub without a decent brawl!

832
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:48,991
No.

833
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:52,950
Have a drink, Vaclav.

834
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,229
- I'm afraid he'll do something to her.

835
01:20:02,358 --> 01:20:03,791
- Looks like it.

836
01:20:04,438 --> 01:20:07,236
You've two options now:
keep your hands off

837
01:20:07,318 --> 01:20:08,751
or marry her.

838
01:20:12,918 --> 01:20:15,352
You don't mind the patients urinating
into it?

839
01:20:26,678 --> 01:20:28,157
- Have you had a divorce here?

840
01:20:28,278 --> 01:20:30,838
- This achievement's got as far
as our village.

841
01:20:37,358 --> 01:20:39,792
- How d'you go about it?
- An application is filed,

842
01:20:39,878 --> 01:20:41,357
There's an application form.

843
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,796
- What about Vasek, er -
the engineer -

844
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:47,716
hope he won't lose his eye?

845
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:49,676
- You wouldn't like him one-eyed?

846
01:20:56,278 --> 01:20:57,836
Take this to the police.
It says

847
01:20:57,918 --> 01:21:00,034
how you hubby's knocked you about.

848
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:02,357
- Do I have to?
- Yeah.

849
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:07,797
Tell him I must speak to him.

850
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:14,792
- Which one?
- Turek.

851
01:21:27,678 --> 01:21:31,068
He'll be supervised
by an experienced worker

852
01:21:31,238 --> 01:21:33,798
He'll also be in the care
of the works doctor.

853
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:38,306
We hereby request you
to release him asap.

854
01:21:38,678 --> 01:21:40,714
Hail Peace! Koutna.

855
01:21:41,118 --> 01:21:42,915
- What's your opinion?

856
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:53,227
- I'll tell you something.
I'd let him go.

857
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,598
He himself wants to go.

858
01:22:00,918 --> 01:22:02,670
Pavek's through with him.

859
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,036
We actually don't know
what to do with him.

860
01:22:05,998 --> 01:22:09,149
I'd let him go.
- You'd let Otik...

861
01:22:09,398 --> 01:22:11,787
...go to Prague?

862
01:22:11,918 --> 01:22:13,397
- Let our Otik...
...go to Prague.

863
01:22:13,878 --> 01:22:16,153
- Fancy them being so set
on this nitwit.

864
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:18,397
I don't get it.

865
01:22:18,878 --> 01:22:20,630
I bet it's because of the house.

866
01:22:20,838 --> 01:22:22,829
- Let's comme clean, comrades.

867
01:22:24,438 --> 01:22:25,871
It is because of the house.

868
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:29,268
The director of METALWOOD likes it here.

869
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:33,556
We'd like to adapt his house
for recreational purposes.

870
01:22:34,998 --> 01:22:36,477
- What did I say?

871
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:38,987
- I wouldn't be against it.

872
01:22:39,478 --> 01:22:42,117
The farm'd benefit as well.

873
01:22:42,318 --> 01:22:46,357
The'd help us -
with spare parts, he said.

874
01:22:46,438 --> 01:22:48,998
That's the way I see it.

875
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:51,947
- You've not come completely clean,
have you?

876
01:22:52,038 --> 01:22:53,551
There is some dirt, eh?

877
01:22:53,758 --> 01:22:56,397
- I've told you what I know.
The house's involved,

878
01:22:56,918 --> 01:22:58,556
there's no denying it.

879
01:23:00,918 --> 01:23:04,877
- You told me the morality
of the village was different.

880
01:23:06,038 --> 01:23:07,517
Unspoilt, eh?

881
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:12,676
Now you want to make a scapegoat
of a village simpleton.

882
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:17,666
Even as a city slicker,
I find it too strong a cuppa.

883
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:21,348
- He's right.
- No moralizing

884
01:23:21,558 --> 01:23:23,150
from a destroyer of family life!

885
01:23:23,478 --> 01:23:25,230
- He's right.
- Talk to the point.

886
01:23:25,318 --> 01:23:26,910
It's Rakosnik we're discussing now!

887
01:23:27,358 --> 01:23:29,076
I'm waiting for you to say
what's behind it,

888
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:30,631
so I don't have to stop recpecting you.

889
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:33,467
- Look at her!

890
01:23:33,918 --> 01:23:36,796
You stop recpecting yourself!

891
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:43,032
- You're a miserable village bumkin!

892
01:23:44,918 --> 01:23:47,876
- What did you say, comrade?
- You shouldn't take liberties

893
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,552
with the chairman.
- Vaclav, I ask you...

894
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:58,149
I told you so, Jaromir.
- I think I've burnt it.

895
01:23:58,478 --> 01:24:00,230
- Show me.
Leave the room, women.

896
01:24:00,998 --> 01:24:02,477
- Don't, auch!

897
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:09,397
- That's all right.

898
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:12,587
You're lucky - a near miss.

899
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:14,316
You will continue to function.

900
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,227
- You mean as an agronomist.

901
01:24:20,558 --> 01:24:22,150
- That'll not be affected in the least.

902
01:24:32,118 --> 01:24:36,555
The Alps overwhelm you, Charles.
But this here moves you.

903
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:41,593
Just look at it - see?

904
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:45,555
It's not a country, it's a garden.

905
01:24:48,358 --> 01:24:50,872
If you have heart, you must feel it.

906
01:24:51,758 --> 01:24:53,589
Go to hell with those chemicals.

907
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:07,598
A beautiful day, eh,

908
01:25:09,558 --> 01:25:10,991
Charles?

909
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:20,548
The blue haze ascande
with the morning lark,

910
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:24,352
Till there,
on the breast of the blushing sky,

911
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:28,234
The carolling and the vapours die...

912
01:25:37,998 --> 01:25:41,673
Over the still lake the mist doth away...

913
01:25:58,798 --> 01:26:01,073
Messing about with in again, doctor?

914
01:26:01,718 --> 01:26:05,677
- Come here!
My back's in two halves.

915
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:10,193
Jau.

916
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:13,710
Tell you something.

917
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,153
If you touch her again,

918
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:19,435
I won't be your friend anymore.

919
01:26:20,038 --> 01:26:23,155
- She's still my wife.
- Sure, but you're not going...

920
01:26:23,758 --> 01:26:25,396
But you're not gonna
knock her about!

921
01:26:26,278 --> 01:26:28,155
Plump up the pillow for me.

922
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:32,153
Jau.

923
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:40,636
When you ran Drapalik over, d'you know
what level you had in your blood?

924
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:47,189
I'll tell them.
I'll be mean - make no mistake.

925
01:26:48,438 --> 01:26:50,633
Hell, it hurts.
Forget driving then.

926
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:55,467
- She's a bitch.
- A pity there aren't shots

927
01:26:55,558 --> 01:26:57,514
for jealousy.

928
01:26:58,758 --> 01:27:00,749
I'd give you a horse dose.

929
01:27:01,398 --> 01:27:05,755
Jau, je, joj.

930
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,631
The aftermath of the Brussels match

931
01:27:50,718 --> 01:27:53,516
is clearly reflected
in the governmental crisis.

932
01:27:57,518 --> 01:28:01,193
- Good Lord!
Karel! Ruzenka!

933
01:28:10,998 --> 01:28:13,637
Come here!
C'mon, help me.

934
01:28:14,438 --> 01:28:16,588
Ooj, jej.
- We need an ambulance.

935
01:28:18,798 --> 01:28:21,915
Brug poisoning.
Pavek.

936
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,311
You're crazy!
- Hush!

937
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:28,870
The gear... the tube.
I'm a Lazarus.

938
01:28:30,358 --> 01:28:32,314
Don't, you'll break me in two.

939
01:28:35,838 --> 01:28:38,398
Karel, can you carry me?
- Yeah.

940
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:43,916
- Slowly!

941
01:28:44,078 --> 01:28:46,273
Jej, jej.
- Careful.

942
01:28:51,838 --> 01:28:53,510
- My slippers - dash!

943
01:28:56,078 --> 01:28:57,352
- Wait!

944
01:29:04,558 --> 01:29:06,708
- Where is he?
Over there.

945
01:29:08,478 --> 01:29:10,708
- Help him.
- Get him here!

946
01:29:11,558 --> 01:29:14,595
Jarda, c'mon!
So, what is it?

947
01:29:15,078 --> 01:29:16,750
What did you gobble up?
- It's all right.

948
01:29:16,998 --> 01:29:18,590
- What's all right?
- Medrin.

949
01:29:18,678 --> 01:29:20,430
- Medrin? How many?
- Yeah, it has remained not much.

950
01:29:20,518 --> 01:29:23,590
Can you hear me?
Who am I?

951
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:25,993
Look at me.
Who am I?

952
01:29:26,678 --> 01:29:28,157
Who am I?

953
01:29:28,478 --> 01:29:30,355
Well?
What're you mumbling?

954
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:32,987
What? Hallo!
- What?

955
01:29:35,478 --> 01:29:37,355
Here they are.
Get up then!

956
01:29:37,518 --> 01:29:39,315
- Come on.
- Where's he?

957
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:43,154
- I'm all right.
- Rot.

958
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:46,950
He gobbled up a little medrin.
- I'd...

959
01:29:47,558 --> 01:29:49,867
- Cut it out, caveman.

960
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,948
Why, it's eased off.

961
01:30:00,318 --> 01:30:02,957
You've put me right.
Look!

962
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:13,634
From the seventh?
- I don't drink from anywhere else.

963
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:25,468
- You've put up with him for years.

964
01:30:25,678 --> 01:30:27,157
- That's it -

965
01:30:28,198 --> 01:30:30,871
he's a life risk.

966
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:35,957
He'll say 1 word per 100 kilometres.

967
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:40,071
We're going to fetch cement
from Hradec Kralove.

968
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,988
In Beroun, he'll say: Beroun.
That's it -

969
01:30:44,998 --> 01:30:46,477
he's done his bit.

970
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:49,235
I'll fall asleep at the wheel one day.

971
01:30:49,558 --> 01:30:51,150
- But otherwise he's a grafter, eh?

972
01:30:51,918 --> 01:30:55,149
- He loads the truck O.K.
I've trained him.

973
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:57,796
He's not reliable though.

974
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:02,952
Where're you off to?
- To a pond.

975
01:31:03,718 --> 01:31:04,673
- Okay.

976
01:31:05,598 --> 01:31:10,035
- He's mentally backward,
but no lunatic.

977
01:31:11,478 --> 01:31:13,912
He's moving to Prague
because you don't want him.

978
01:31:13,998 --> 01:31:15,511
You know that's the reason.

979
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:18,507
You're the only one who can stop him.

980
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:21,233
If someone's the only one who can,

981
01:31:21,798 --> 01:31:23,311
he must do it.

982
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,550
- I said when the harvest was over.

983
01:31:26,038 --> 01:31:27,517
The harvest is over.

984
01:31:27,998 --> 01:31:30,466
Tomorrow's the last day.
I'm through.

985
01:31:51,918 --> 01:31:54,512
Good morning, comrade director.

986
01:32:00,838 --> 01:32:02,317
I think it's not bad...

987
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:13,107
- Quiet, Spot.
It's only some gentleman from Prague.

988
01:32:14,838 --> 01:32:16,317
They're going to renovate the place.

989
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:18,796
Imported plastic thatching

990
01:32:19,078 --> 01:32:22,036
from West Germany.

991
01:32:23,998 --> 01:32:26,910
Tear down the W.C.

992
01:32:27,998 --> 01:32:30,148
They'll put in a flush toilet.

993
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:33,949
What about the doorstep?
Concrete - that's it!

994
01:32:35,998 --> 01:32:38,114
What about an English lawn?

995
01:32:39,078 --> 01:32:43,196
Yes, we will have an english lawn.
A swimming pool to take 3 strokes in...

996
01:32:46,598 --> 01:32:48,156
- Is it drinking water?

997
01:32:48,598 --> 01:32:50,031
- It is.

998
01:32:54,078 --> 01:32:56,194
Only now we have the mouth disease
around.

999
01:33:02,878 --> 01:33:05,472
- Here we are...

1000
01:33:16,358 --> 01:33:18,553
We'll see you about the paperwork later.

1001
01:34:20,638 --> 01:34:22,151
Sold the house?

1002
01:35:15,238 --> 01:35:17,832
They delivered a new car -
trying it out.

1003
01:35:23,838 --> 01:35:28,787
Boys - it drives of its own accord!
