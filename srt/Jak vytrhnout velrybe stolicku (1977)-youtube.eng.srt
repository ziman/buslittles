¤ HOW TO PULL A WHALE'S TOOTH ¤

2
0:0:44,589 --> 0:0:50,593
Vasek, why is there a bandage around the whale's head?

3
0:0:52,521 --> 0:0:55,730
Because she's got a toothache!

4
0:1:12,436 --> 0:1:15,047
What's up, boys? Don't you want me to give you a lift?

5
0:1:15,148 --> 0:1:15,845
Yes!

6
0:1:17,041 --> 0:1:17,870
You know him?

7
0:1:17,970 --> 0:1:20,255
Of course. He's my daddy!

8
0:1:20,953 --> 0:1:22,078
And which one?

9
0:1:22,440 --> 0:1:24,489
A spare one.

10
0:1:37,571 --> 0:1:42,169
That's impossible. My mom says that every primo man is already married.

11
0:1:42,344 --> 0:1:43,661
You have to know how to search!

12
0:1:44,336 --> 0:1:45,541
Well, just like my mom!

13
0:1:45,967 --> 0:1:50,901
I just wore a tie, introduced myself as a minister,...

14
0:1:51,001 --> 0:1:57,066
we had steaks, Pilsner beer, and now we're friends.

15
0:1:57,494 --> 0:2:0,844
When I grow up, I'll also deliver milk!

16
0:2:0,859 --> 0:2:2,466
I'll also work like my dad.

17
0:2:2,858 --> 0:2:3,982
A climber!

18
0:2:15,517 --> 0:2:16,773
You are already here?

19
0:2:16,873 --> 0:2:17,516
Yes.

20
0:2:18,852 --> 0:2:20,879
I'll examine the exercise books at home,...

21
0:2:20,979 --> 0:2:22,778
he'll get new pajamas...

22
0:2:22,878 --> 0:2:26,421
and make him turn the lights off at 8.

23
0:2:26,714 --> 0:2:28,647
And Carla, no chocolate!

24
0:2:28,838 --> 0:2:30,164
Aniczka, and what about dinner?

25
0:2:30,264 --> 0:2:31,406
I'm going to make it by myself.

26
0:2:32,562 --> 0:2:36,024
Vasek! Vasíczek!

27
0:2:36,314 --> 0:2:38,971
I know that you're at home.

28
0:2:39,249 --> 0:2:43,446
Wow! Somebody washed the dishes here.

29
0:2:43,782 --> 0:2:47,553
Somebody probably wants an ice cream as a reward.

30
0:2:47,821 --> 0:2:50,031
My darling!

31
0:2:52,503 --> 0:2:55,474
So where is my nice little boy?

32
0:2:55,805 --> 0:2:57,707
Boo!

33
0:2:57,833 --> 0:2:58,754
What's that?

34
0:2:58,762 --> 0:2:59,496
It's a dog.

35
0:2:59,597 --> 0:3:2,499
What did you promise to me? That you'll leave all the strange dogs alone.

36
0:3:2,581 --> 0:3:5,943
It's not a strange dog. It's Arnold!

37
0:3:6,029 --> 0:3:7,185
He's able to get the dust out of the duster.

38
0:3:7,285 --> 0:3:7,927
Oh please...

39
0:3:8,229 --> 0:3:10,158
He followed me home. Can I keep him?

40
0:3:10,534 --> 0:3:12,697
And who would take care of him?

41
0:3:12,798 --> 0:3:17,009
You'll take him to Valenta's in the evening? And at night Carla will go with him, won't she?

42
0:3:17,586 --> 0:3:22,877
If my dad was here, neither me nor the dog would have to go to Valenta's.

43
0:3:22,977 --> 0:3:26,453
You just determined you're going to make me upset.

44
0:3:26,806 --> 0:3:30,449
Didn't you promise to me that you wouldn't talk about it?

45
0:3:30,498 --> 0:3:32,502
I'd also like to have a friend.

46
0:3:32,837 --> 0:3:36,529
You'll get a dog. A nicer one.

47
0:3:36,804 --> 0:3:38,356
But when you are older.

48
0:3:38,456 --> 0:3:41,098
He's nice. He is friends with children.

49
0:3:41,471 --> 0:3:42,757
He catches the second league.

50
0:3:42,858 --> 0:3:44,118
Who? The dog?

51
0:3:44,247 --> 0:3:46,882
No. His master. He's primo.

52
0:3:46,909 --> 0:3:47,987
A goalkeeper.

53
0:3:48,298 --> 0:3:50,325
Please, what are you talking about? Which goalkeeper?

54
0:3:50,465 --> 0:3:54,102
Our school caretaker. You're definitely going to like him!

55
0:3:54,560 --> 0:3:56,744
Why would I be supposed to like him?

56
0:3:56,850 --> 0:3:58,355
Because he's not married.

57
0:3:59,811 --> 0:4:4,667
Listen to me: you'll return that dog immediately and I don't want to hear a word about marriage.

58
0:5:20,658 --> 0:5:21,712
Damn it, I'm going to have a bruise again!

59
0:5:21,856 --> 0:5:27,896
Paris is a boor. But Julie should be gentle.

60
0:5:27,924 --> 0:5:32,450
But it wasn't Paris, but that idiot Romeo.

61
0:5:32,550 --> 0:5:33,493
Thanks.

62
0:6:10,448 --> 0:6:12,145
On Sunday again.

63
0:6:12,245 --> 0:6:14,472
The third time this month.

64
0:6:14,572 --> 0:6:18,216
When the troupe from Warsaw comes, you're going to have holiday for a whole week!

65
0:6:18,316 --> 0:6:20,652
And what about rehearsals?

66
0:6:21,909 --> 0:6:25,278
Don't you really want to go somewhere to have a dinner?

67
0:6:29,845 --> 0:6:34,176
Vasek decided that we need somebody at home.

68
0:6:34,291 --> 0:6:37,010
How so? You explained it to him.

69
0:6:37,139 --> 0:6:38,704
I thought it was over.

70
0:6:39,039 --> 0:6:45,216
It was. Until his friend's mother got remarried.

71
0:6:47,226 --> 0:6:52,731
Vasek's going to get over it. When he's older, he'll have other problems.

72
0:6:52,826 --> 0:6:56,869
What if he doesn't get over it?

73
0:6:58,901 --> 0:7:4,232
I hope you're not going to blame me. After four years.

74
0:7:4,644 --> 0:7:8,122
You can't let Vasek talk into your private business.

75
0:7:8,223 --> 0:7:10,756
I've already forbidden him to talk about marriage.

76
0:7:10,801 --> 0:7:12,067
That's right.

77
0:7:13,292 --> 0:7:14,576
It's even worse.

78
0:7:15,403 --> 0:7:21,131
Yesterday he put the third bowl with a toothbrush on the shelf in the bathroom.

79
0:7:21,166 --> 0:7:23,947
You overreact to everything.

80
0:7:29,182 --> 0:7:32,123
I'll wait for you, shouldn't I?

81
0:7:33,204 --> 0:7:35,422
I told you: it's not possible.

82
0:7:35,522 --> 0:7:36,830
Vasek is at Valenta's?

83
0:7:36,993 --> 0:7:38,945
No, Carla is at our place.

84
0:7:39,738 --> 0:7:43,960
The last you had free time was 10 days ago.

85
0:8:4,411 --> 0:8:8,021
If you want to, come upstairs.

86
0:8:10,107 --> 0:8:16,042
You are really able to make it easier for me...

87
0:8:30,272 --> 0:8:32,505
I have some free time next Sunday.

88
0:8:32,631 --> 0:8:37,060
We'll go to the cinema to watch funnies. Do you want to?

89
0:8:37,095 --> 0:8:41,077
Or you can invite Standa over and you can play with cars.

90
0:8:41,112 --> 0:8:45,563
Standa can't come now. Now he drives around with his new daddy with milk.

91
0:8:45,663 --> 0:8:48,608
He's got rabbits! And also a new grandpa.

92
0:8:48,772 --> 0:8:52,972
Mommy... I'd also like a grandpa. At least one.

93
0:8:53,358 --> 0:8:55,670
Tell me rather, where you were yesterday when you pulled your trousers apart.

94
0:8:55,951 --> 0:8:57,536
I was tracking.

95
0:8:58,432 --> 0:8:59,572
A dog again?

96
0:8:59,858 --> 0:9:2,225
No, a sports teacher.

97
0:9:5,518 --> 0:9:6,868
Vasek?!

98
0:9:7,655 --> 0:9:10,078
I'm detective Colombo. He's not married!

99
0:9:10,241 --> 0:9:13,626
You know what, Colombo? I'll really give you a few slaps!

100
0:9:13,760 --> 0:9:17,785
I'd take it. It's worth it if we become three again!

101
0:9:18,415 --> 0:9:19,338
Look, Vasík.

102
0:9:19,438 --> 0:9:24,849
If you put away your toothbrush by yourself and you ask for something reasonable, I'll give it to you, all right?

103
0:9:28,756 --> 0:9:29,593
Come on.

104
0:9:29,852 --> 0:9:30,491
All right.

105
0:9:30,655 --> 0:9:32,990
You'll take me to the mountains. These holidays.

106
0:9:33,350 --> 0:9:36,413
Couldn't you wish something better? What about seaside in summer?

107
0:9:36,578 --> 0:9:41,603
Why don't you ever want to go to the mountains? Because dad was a climber?

108
0:9:42,899 --> 0:9:45,229
Because the theater doesn't have a winter holiday.

109
0:9:45,329 --> 0:9:46,901
You'll make them, then.

110
0:9:47,001 --> 0:9:47,883
You will arrange it?

111
0:9:47,984 --> 0:9:48,654
Of course!

112
0:9:48,754 --> 0:9:49,783
And how, please?

113
0:9:49,883 --> 0:9:51,033
Look!

114
0:10:2,114 --> 0:10:4,357
You're my darling!

115
0:10:6,298 --> 0:10:7,837
Can you ski?

116
0:10:7,937 --> 0:10:12,074
I'm not allowed to ski. What if I broke a leg?

117
0:10:12,116 --> 0:10:15,213
Eat! We'll talk about it later.

118
0:10:15,469 --> 0:10:19,955
Don't be afraid, Mommy. I won't get killed like my dad.

119
0:10:22,066 --> 0:10:28,208
Everybody's going to the mountains! All the boys have dads, but I don't have even a dog!

120
0:10:31,418 --> 0:10:32,763
"My mommy."

121
0:10:32,913 --> 0:10:38,544
So, children. Before we start writing, we'll think about our mommies.

122
0:10:38,921 --> 0:10:42,077
What she's like, what she does, what she looks like...

123
0:10:42,177 --> 0:10:45,211
~ And what if both of them come?
~ Doesn't matter, there were six of them in our place.

124
0:10:45,311 --> 0:10:47,285
~ At one moment?!
~ No, one after another.

125
0:10:48,162 --> 0:10:57,916
Benda, Martinec. Put your exercise books on the table, you'll take an exercise paper and you'll rewrite the essay after the lessons.

126
0:10:58,255 --> 0:11:3,303
Please, comrade teacher, I can't do it today. I have to cook dinner.

127
0:11:3,372 --> 0:11:5,694
Vasek, don't clown around. Sit down!

128
0:11:6,246 --> 0:11:8,583
Talk, children, what is your mommy like?

129
0:11:9,761 --> 0:11:10,653
Nice.

130
0:11:11,100 --> 0:11:12,483
Nice eyes.

131
0:11:12,878 --> 0:11:14,145
Curly-haired.

132
0:11:14,672 --> 0:11:15,674
Truthful.

133
0:11:15,774 --> 0:11:16,631
Vasek!

134
0:11:16,731 --> 0:11:19,690
I'm already putting it down in writing!

135
0:11:25,802 --> 0:11:55,291
One, two, one, two,...and step...one, two,...one, two, three...one, two, three, four...

136
0:12:13,874 --> 0:12:19,260
Spartacus is the greatest man of antiquity and the role of Friga is a great chance for you.

137
0:12:19,877 --> 0:12:21,792
It's getting dark, they are both free.

138
0:12:23,465 --> 0:12:24,576
Get ready.

139
0:12:25,510 --> 0:12:27,229
And go.

140
0:12:28,766 --> 0:12:31,141
Everything is in the music, so listen to it.

141
0:12:35,538 --> 0:12:37,097
You are happy.

142
0:12:43,543 --> 0:12:45,392
This is useless...I can't work like this!

143
0:12:45,492 --> 0:12:47,000
I got up at 6 o'clock.

144
0:12:47,100 --> 0:12:48,980
How many opportunities do you think you are going to have?

145
0:12:49,080 --> 0:12:53,389
You're going to be retired before someone writes another ballet!

146
0:12:53,489 --> 0:12:54,672
Everybody can arrange it.

147
0:12:54,772 --> 0:12:56,666
~ Everybody else has a grandma.
~ What about your mother?

148
0:12:57,274 --> 0:13:1,003
You know her. She thinks that if she left for a few days,
the hospital would collapse.

149
0:13:3,105 --> 0:13:5,483
So you want to travel...?

150
0:13:7,096 --> 0:13:15,333
That week in February, when the school holidays are, I don't have performances, I thought that if you let me go, I'd...

151
0:13:15,433 --> 0:13:16,859
After what I told you?

152
0:13:18,133 --> 0:13:20,332
I'll make up for all the rehearsals.

153
0:13:20,432 --> 0:13:26,909
I'm nearly never at home. I can't stand the boy's complaints!

154
0:13:27,009 --> 0:13:29,849
That's out of the question. You're not going anywhere!

155
0:13:34,154 --> 0:14:21,393
¤ Radio plays a dramatic story about climbers on Mount Everest ¤

156
0:14:22,503 --> 0:14:28,195
Oh my God! Leave it alone, please. The steaks were supposed to be for Sunday.

157
0:14:41,406 --> 0:14:43,088
Go wash yourself.

158
0:14:43,849 --> 0:14:47,996
I wonder that you can listen to it...

159
0:15:8,771 --> 0:15:10,652
You bought beer?

160
0:15:32,772 --> 0:15:35,430
I'm asking you, why did you buy the beer?

161
0:15:35,530 --> 0:15:37,521
I thought he would come.

162
0:15:38,122 --> 0:15:38,851
Who?

163
0:15:39,955 --> 0:15:41,003
The Minister.

164
0:15:42,828 --> 0:15:46,348
Aniczka? You should go.

165
0:15:51,869 --> 0:15:55,378
You know what, Carla? Vasek can take the TV to his room.

166
0:15:57,187 --> 0:15:59,042
There's Chaplin at 19:30.

167
0:16:2,330 --> 0:16:6,733
I don't want Chaplin. I want you to be at home! Just like a proper mom...

168
0:16:26,362 --> 0:16:30,395
To make Vasek to be the main class cleaner is just like making a goat the head gardener.

169
0:16:30,495 --> 0:16:33,732
But this week he was amazing.

170
0:16:33,833 --> 0:16:43,994
He really cleaned up the classroom and in addition he was helping the school caretaker and sports teacher.

171
0:16:45,479 --> 0:16:49,420
I thought he'd done something wrong when you called me at the theater.

172
0:16:49,903 --> 0:16:53,339
We wrote an essay yesterday.

173
0:16:54,515 --> 0:16:59,345
Please, don't tell Vasek that I let you read it.

174
0:17:6,994 --> 0:17:13,540
He's a mug. "Mommy is going to get married." Such nonsense!

175
0:17:15,561 --> 0:17:18,016
Do you know what's the best about children?

176
0:17:18,582 --> 0:17:21,470
That they can see the world how it's supposed to be.

177
0:17:21,814 --> 0:17:27,825
And their world is mainly a harmonic home.

178
0:17:31,778 --> 0:17:35,393
And what would you do, if you were me, Mrs. Teacher?

179
0:17:37,567 --> 0:17:40,928
I would at least think about it, Mommy.

180
0:18:5,117 --> 0:18:6,997
You're going to let me go to the mountains.

181
0:18:8,388 --> 0:18:10,805
You'd have to resign from the theater.

182
0:18:11,094 --> 0:18:13,937
I can also break up with you.

183
0:18:23,079 --> 0:18:25,696
Mommy! Mommy's here.

184
0:18:26,114 --> 0:18:27,636
You usually don't even speak to me...

185
0:18:29,746 --> 0:18:32,200
Guess who came to have dinner with us?

186
0:18:35,204 --> 0:18:41,309
~ Girl, in a wig again. That will destroy your hair.
~ You scared me!

187
0:18:41,812 --> 0:18:46,881
If it didn't involve us, we could just laugh at the Vasek's ideas.

188
0:18:47,235 --> 0:18:50,271
It was really funny to make steaks for the school caretaker...

189
0:18:52,291 --> 0:18:54,194
Do you go anywhere on evenings at all?

190
0:18:54,864 --> 0:18:56,018
To theater.

191
0:18:57,092 --> 0:19:3,374
Why don't you call me? If I don't have a night shift, I'll be able to wait here with Vasek until 11.

192
0:19:3,767 --> 0:19:5,856
And in the evening you'll have to travel through the whole Prague.

193
0:19:7,206 --> 0:19:8,371
And what about Jindrich?

194
0:19:11,503 --> 0:19:16,519
If he had children, I wouldn't say a word. But in this situation...

195
0:19:18,172 --> 0:19:19,768
Do you think this is a life, Anna?

196
0:19:20,823 --> 0:19:22,484
He likes me.

197
0:19:22,918 --> 0:19:25,293
Then why doesn't he finally get divorced?

198
0:19:25,642 --> 0:19:27,674
Please, let it be.

199
0:19:29,192 --> 0:19:29,950
All right then.

200
0:19:31,021 --> 0:19:33,847
I'll talk to Jindrich myself.

201
0:19:35,803 --> 0:19:37,546
You've never meddled.

202
0:19:38,142 --> 0:19:40,000
I'm not going to humiliate myself.

203
0:19:40,297 --> 0:19:42,061
You behave just like life hasn't taught you enough.

204
0:19:44,879 --> 0:19:47,766
How long do you want to handle it by yourself?

205
0:19:49,100 --> 0:19:51,389
It's hard with you, Anna.

206
0:19:51,906 --> 0:19:58,956
When I told you in that situation a baby shouldn't be born, you didn't talk to me for a half year.

207
0:19:59,052 --> 0:20:1,178
You did it your way.

208
0:20:2,694 --> 0:20:5,637
You didn't know what you were facing.

209
0:20:6,250 --> 0:20:11,107
Talk to Jindrich. You'll save yourself only if you get married.

210
0:20:11,650 --> 0:20:15,800
You can always give me advice. But you can't help me and take Vasek to the mountains.

211
0:20:16,017 --> 0:20:20,572
I've already told you that mothers with children will get a holiday in that school holidays week.

212
0:20:21,325 --> 0:20:24,039
Then I have bad luck, since I don't work as a surgery nurse.

213
0:20:24,841 --> 0:20:29,044
I can save up a few days of holiday if I work 16-hour shifts.

214
0:20:29,949 --> 0:20:31,206
I'll take Vasek to my place.

215
0:20:32,039 --> 0:20:37,982
No, that wouldn't help. All the people in the house know me, somebody could tell Vasek something...

216
0:20:38,080 --> 0:20:39,888
Someday Vasek will know it anyway.

217
0:20:40,834 --> 0:20:43,012
How long are you going to hide it from him?

218
0:20:45,287 --> 0:20:50,268
Many children live just with a mother. Aren't there divorced marriages?

219
0:20:51,413 --> 0:20:55,739
But you -- are not divorced...

220
0:21:22,972 --> 0:21:27,366
Come in, little dog, come in. Don't be afraid. This is my mommy.

221
0:21:29,287 --> 0:21:30,870
Send that calf away immediately!

222
0:21:45,050 --> 0:21:47,831
Mommy! What about me??

223
0:22:13,587 --> 0:22:16,558
Mommy, why was uncle Jindrich at the train station with flowers?

224
0:22:17,046 --> 0:22:18,897
He came to tell me not to break a leg.

225
0:22:18,982 --> 0:22:20,176
You like him?

226
0:22:21,221 --> 0:22:22,159
A lot.

227
0:22:22,194 --> 0:22:23,837
But it's also going to cost a lot of money.

228
0:22:24,598 --> 0:22:26,174
I meant Jindrich.

229
0:22:27,378 --> 0:22:28,676
Why are you talking about that again?

230
0:22:29,352 --> 0:22:32,255
I don't like him. I'd know some better guys.

231
0:22:33,843 --> 0:22:39,352
Vasek, I'm warning you. I took you here with one condition -- that you'll stop finding me a groom.

232
0:22:39,452 --> 0:22:42,645
You can rely on me!

233
0:22:55,382 --> 0:22:57,475
Daddy, Daddy, I can't find ski poles!

234
0:22:58,063 --> 0:23:0,784
Then buy a medicine against sclerosis.

235
0:23:7,200 --> 0:23:10,635
Thank you. Mrs. Bendová, you have telegram here.

236
0:23:12,335 --> 0:23:13,548
Here.

237
0:23:20,417 --> 0:23:25,197
I need to call Prague. Immediately. And a second call at 7 pm.

238
0:23:25,297 --> 0:23:26,682
All right.

239
0:23:36,723 --> 0:23:39,086
Vasek! You're not going to leave the terrace until I come back!

240
0:23:39,186 --> 0:23:40,411
Of course!

241
0:23:50,020 --> 0:23:50,831
Attention!

242
0:23:51,817 --> 0:23:52,837
I'm going!

243
0:23:53,496 --> 0:23:54,710
Out of the way!

244
0:23:57,667 --> 0:23:58,484
Attention!

245
0:23:59,373 --> 0:24:0,500
I'm going!

246
0:24:8,216 --> 0:24:16,930
Stupid boy! If I were your dad, I would beat your buttocks that you wouldn't be able to sit for a week!

247
0:24:17,449 --> 0:24:19,017
~ Are you OK?
~ Yes.

248
0:24:19,117 --> 0:24:21,467
~ What about your legs?
~ Tangled.

249
0:24:21,902 --> 0:24:26,228
Stand up then.

250
0:24:26,328 --> 0:24:28,448
~ Where are you from?
~ From the Snow White lodge!

251
0:24:28,548 --> 0:24:31,562
From the Snow White lodge? Hm. I'm really happy.

252
0:24:31,662 --> 0:24:37,420
With whom are you here? Why are you looking at me? With who are you here?

253
0:24:37,929 --> 0:24:39,634
With Mom, of course!

254
0:24:45,770 --> 0:24:50,381
Take your skis --- and go.

255
0:24:58,078 --> 0:25:0,658
Hello, sir, are you married?

256
0:25:2,817 --> 0:25:5,806
Vasek, Vasíczek, come quickly!

257
0:25:7,622 --> 0:25:10,758
This sweater really suits you, you're very nice in it.

258
0:25:10,858 --> 0:25:12,301
Why aren't you wearing pajamas?

259
0:25:12,387 --> 0:25:14,065
Am I supposed to go to the dinner in pajamas?

260
0:25:14,165 --> 0:25:16,500
No. We are going to have dinner here.

261
0:25:17,127 --> 0:25:21,636
Mom, Mommy, I want to go to a bar. At least for an ice cream.

262
0:25:21,767 --> 0:25:25,169
No, you have a lot of sins today and I've ordered a call.

263
0:25:28,798 --> 0:25:32,725
Mommy, I arranged something. He's going to wait there for me.

264
0:25:32,825 --> 0:25:33,218
Who?

265
0:25:33,318 --> 0:25:35,415
One of my friends.

266
0:25:36,584 --> 0:25:38,104
I'll return in a while.

267
0:25:38,608 --> 0:25:41,511
And you --- stay in the room, do you understand?

268
0:26:27,037 --> 0:26:27,959
Anna.

269
0:26:29,930 --> 0:26:36,122
Oh wow, you grew up! Even though you're still so petite.

270
0:26:37,179 --> 0:26:39,429
You don't remember me.

271
0:26:39,529 --> 0:26:41,383
~ I...
~ Don't you remember?

272
0:26:42,875 --> 0:26:44,307
~ I'm waiting here.
~ Ma'am, your call.

273
0:26:46,424 --> 0:26:47,734
I'm sorry.

274
0:26:52,696 --> 0:26:57,062
No, the telegram wasn't sent by Jindrich, but by the theater.

275
0:26:57,163 --> 0:27:0,315
Mommy... Please, come and stay at least those two days.

276
0:27:1,366 --> 0:27:4,970
I can't tell Vasek that we've just arrived and we have to go straight home again.

277
0:27:5,070 --> 0:27:7,132
I'm going to return on Thursday.

278
0:27:9,275 --> 0:27:11,243
It's not important who's sick.

279
0:27:11,343 --> 0:27:13,987
There's a change in the theater.

280
0:27:15,531 --> 0:27:18,612
We can't do anything then.

281
0:27:25,802 --> 0:27:29,400
~ How much is it?
~ One moment. I'll ask the post office.

282
0:27:33,236 --> 0:27:36,522
How many years since we haven't seen each other?

283
0:27:36,622 --> 0:27:41,640
You're here on holiday? As an instructor again?

284
0:27:41,740 --> 0:27:43,233
I've worked here for seven years.

285
0:27:43,333 --> 0:27:43,984
Here?

286
0:27:44,085 --> 0:27:45,934
Here I have a date with one boy.

287
0:27:46,034 --> 0:27:46,932
With a boy?

288
0:27:47,032 --> 0:27:53,558
I even don't know his name. I promised him to have an ice cream with him in the evening and now I've met you here!

289
0:27:53,659 --> 0:27:57,079
You're better and better. Instead of a drink, you invite boys for ice cream?

290
0:27:57,179 --> 0:28:1,082
But he's really small. You haven't seen such a boy yet.

291
0:28:1,182 --> 0:28:5,509
He told me his mommy loves dancing and if I wanted, he could take her with him.

292
0:28:5,902 --> 0:28:7,674
Please, why are you telling me?

293
0:28:7,774 --> 0:28:10,064
Well, you asked me what I was doing here.

294
0:28:11,181 --> 0:28:13,136
Maybe we'll meet again.

295
0:28:13,858 --> 0:28:14,839
Definitely.

296
0:28:15,509 --> 0:28:19,050
So don't delay yourself. Don't make him wait in the bar.

297
0:28:19,249 --> 0:28:21,339
He isn't waiting in the bar. He's there.

298
0:28:21,739 --> 0:28:23,461
Vasek! Come here!

299
0:28:23,561 --> 0:28:24,633
You have a primo boy.

300
0:28:24,733 --> 0:28:27,187
He's wild. What is this?

301
0:28:27,288 --> 0:28:28,461
That's a jacket.

302
0:28:29,637 --> 0:28:30,876
Say goodbye and go to bed.

303
0:28:30,976 --> 0:28:31,502
Goodbye.

304
0:28:31,602 --> 0:28:32,391
Bye.

305
0:28:38,229 --> 0:28:41,017
Prague. Who wanted to pay the call to Prague?

306
0:28:41,405 --> 0:28:42,775
I'll pay it.

307
0:28:45,062 --> 0:28:54,540
Mommy! Mommy! Open up! I didn't tell him anything! Really! Mommy! Open up!

308
0:28:57,966 --> 0:29:1,445
Vasek, you are going to worry me to death. What did you tell him?

309
0:29:1,480 --> 0:29:3,630
Only number of our room.

310
0:29:4,078 --> 0:29:5,179
And you invited him, didn't you?

311
0:29:5,279 --> 0:29:8,630
Yes, I wanted you to look at him.

312
0:29:8,730 --> 0:29:9,444
What?

313
0:29:9,544 --> 0:29:13,735
If we liked him, then we could be friends with him.

314
0:29:13,835 --> 0:29:15,509
That's all.

315
0:29:17,238 --> 0:29:20,390
Pack your stuff up. We're going home.

316
0:29:20,490 --> 0:29:22,133
Tomorrow.

317
0:29:39,081 --> 0:29:40,781
Mountain Rescue.

318
0:29:40,881 --> 0:29:45,140
No. He's on the hill.

319
0:29:48,191 --> 0:29:49,180
What are you doing here?

320
0:29:49,280 --> 0:29:50,989
I came for help.

321
0:29:51,089 --> 0:29:52,000
What happened?

322
0:29:52,100 --> 0:29:54,157
Mommy forbade me to talk about it.

323
0:29:54,490 --> 0:29:55,216
About what?

324
0:29:55,316 --> 0:29:57,089
That we're going home today.

325
0:29:57,330 --> 0:30:0,012
She promises we'll return, but we won't be back.

326
0:30:0,431 --> 0:30:2,210
I know her!

327
0:30:3,169 --> 0:30:6,561
You finally called. How is it on the hill?

328
0:30:6,661 --> 0:30:9,445
If mom knew that I'm under someone's supervision...

329
0:30:9,545 --> 0:30:10,931
Avalanche situation?

330
0:30:11,031 --> 0:30:14,759
I'll take care of myself, anyway. I'll sweep, I'll do laundry.

331
0:30:14,859 --> 0:30:20,263
When it's warmer, when it's warmer. Warn these locations immediately.

332
0:30:20,398 --> 0:30:24,967
Please, sir, let me stay here. I'm made for the mountains.

333
0:30:25,067 --> 0:30:28,478
So you're applying for service here? How many years?

334
0:30:28,579 --> 0:30:31,372
Two days. Until Mom comes back.

335
0:30:31,880 --> 0:30:32,818
Who's that boy?

336
0:30:33,555 --> 0:30:36,369
Well, he's such a Dopey from Snow White, isn't he?

337
0:30:36,469 --> 0:30:39,725
You make jokes and there's blocked snow plow in Labský Dùl.

338
0:30:39,825 --> 0:30:41,586
I've been having fun with that for a half hour now.

339
0:30:42,251 --> 0:30:45,693
Call Karel. I'll be there.

340
0:30:45,793 --> 0:30:47,063
And what about me?

341
0:30:47,163 --> 0:30:51,015
You know what? A real man never begs.

342
0:30:58,283 --> 0:31:1,019
If it helps you, you can leave the boy here.

343
0:31:1,240 --> 0:31:2,034
Vasek?

344
0:31:2,134 --> 0:31:7,091
You got more of them? It's hard for him. He's just come and he has to go back to the town.

345
0:31:7,191 --> 0:31:8,429
Well, he'll get over it.

346
0:31:8,628 --> 0:31:14,915
There are things that no woman can understand. Simply -- I'll take care of Vasek for those two days.

347
0:31:15,015 --> 0:31:16,791
I don't understand why.

348
0:31:18,118 --> 0:31:22,571
We haven't had opportunity to talk yet. I'll have a guarantee that you're going to come back.

349
0:31:23,148 --> 0:31:24,977
You would be able to take care of a child??

350
0:31:25,077 --> 0:31:27,734
You can rely on me!

351
0:31:29,580 --> 0:31:31,983
I'm not so sure about that.

352
0:31:41,505 --> 0:31:50,027
Vasek, we'll go to Rokytnice for ski poles. And we'll take Mom to the train station.

353
0:31:50,875 --> 0:31:53,263
Vasek, are you really going to let me go by myself?

354
0:31:53,490 --> 0:31:55,492
You've already said I could. Don't worry.

355
0:31:56,595 --> 0:31:58,719
Lubos rescues people from avalanches!

356
0:31:58,819 --> 0:32:1,716
What do you mean --- Lubos? It's always Mr. Richman for you!

357
0:32:1,816 --> 0:32:5,614
Mommy doesn't know that we've been already friends for two hours.

358
0:32:5,714 --> 0:32:7,389
Vasek is coming with me!

359
0:32:7,489 --> 0:32:12,266
You have a great seat by the window. Don't worry, I've already cared for whole climbing team.

360
0:32:12,366 --> 0:32:13,943
I'll die from fear anyway.

361
0:32:14,352 --> 0:32:16,399
That would be a pity.

362
0:32:17,778 --> 0:32:20,999
Mommy is prima. She's already started calling you by first name.

363
0:32:23,708 --> 0:32:24,546
Bye.

364
0:32:49,363 --> 0:32:51,652
How did you figure out I'm a climber?

365
0:32:52,072 --> 0:32:55,699
I'm Detective Colombo. You have crampons in your cabin.

366
0:32:56,515 --> 0:32:57,627
You know what they are?

367
0:32:58,075 --> 0:32:59,314
~ Of course!
~ What?

368
0:32:59,572 --> 0:33:1,358
Metal boots for climbing.

369
0:33:2,485 --> 0:33:3,725
Look, where you are throwing the snow!

370
0:33:5,713 --> 0:33:8,573
And what is Chomolungma?

371
0:33:8,878 --> 0:33:13,265
Mount Everest. Hillary and Tenzing were the first people there.

372
0:33:17,373 --> 0:33:20,062
And which mountain over 8,000 meters high was first visited by people?

373
0:33:20,344 --> 0:33:21,296
Annapurna.

374
0:33:22,285 --> 0:33:24,657
And where were the most dead people?

375
0:33:24,757 --> 0:33:26,278
Nanga Parbat.

376
0:33:27,573 --> 0:33:29,308
And who was the first up there?

377
0:33:29,699 --> 0:33:33,279
Hermann Buhl. He's my second favorite. After my daddy.

378
0:33:34,485 --> 0:33:35,464
You're good.

379
0:33:35,564 --> 0:33:43,911
I have books. The Unbeaten Mountain. Tigers from Himalaya. That's on radio.

380
0:33:44,152 --> 0:33:46,577
~ Done?
~ Done!

381
0:33:46,814 --> 0:33:48,424
Go!

382
0:33:50,562 --> 0:33:52,499
And who buys those books for you?

383
0:33:52,773 --> 0:33:53,473
Daddy?

384
0:33:53,845 --> 0:33:56,071
Daddy was also a climber!

385
0:33:58,742 --> 0:33:59,906
And what does he do now?

386
0:34:0,006 --> 0:34:1,587
Now he's dead.

387
0:34:4,617 --> 0:34:6,626
Don't be upset with me, Vasek, I didn't know that.

388
0:34:7,043 --> 0:34:12,776
When they were walking in a line, he was the last one. And suddenly there was an avalanche.

389
0:34:13,524 --> 0:34:16,917
Wow! We rescued a snow plow!

390
0:34:20,595 --> 0:34:26,984
You'll take my sleeping bag. Once my only friend also borrowed it.

391
0:34:27,084 --> 0:34:31,730
He got intestinal flu. That's really bad, when it's -20° C.

392
0:34:31,830 --> 0:34:32,710
And where did you sleep?

393
0:34:32,810 --> 0:34:35,059
Well, we didn't sleep much.

394
0:34:35,159 --> 0:34:36,528
Do you have a lot of friends?

395
0:34:36,961 --> 0:34:42,627
No, I have a lot of acquaintances. Friends are boys who you can always rely on.

396
0:34:43,122 --> 0:34:46,787
Mom says that daddy had no friends.

397
0:34:46,887 --> 0:34:49,121
That's weird.

398
0:34:49,222 --> 0:34:54,963
When you hold the same rope with somebody, you must trust him. You cover his back and he covers yours.

399
0:34:55,063 --> 0:34:57,475
Then there's a real friendship.

400
0:34:57,576 --> 0:35:3,476
Maybe Mom thinks that somebody could have rescued him. Maybe the friend of his.

401
0:35:35,371 --> 0:35:42,704
I'd like to call Spindler¿v Mlýn, 93439. Thank you.

402
0:35:43,381 --> 0:35:45,174
You can cancel it.

403
0:35:45,764 --> 0:35:47,267
He called himself.

404
0:35:47,709 --> 0:35:48,614
Who?

405
0:35:49,069 --> 0:35:50,615
Spindler¿v Mlýn.

406
0:35:51,464 --> 0:35:55,139
He told me to write it down, in case I have sclerosis...

407
0:35:56,473 --> 0:36:2,189
Vasek ate seven dumplings, brushed his teeth, and now he's asleep like a log.

408
0:36:3,011 --> 0:36:6,133
He's an idiot. He's making fun of me.

409
0:36:6,462 --> 0:36:12,458
But he called an hour later, saying it's snowing outside, and that he can't fall asleep.

410
0:36:12,558 --> 0:36:15,161
Bozenka, I'm hungry!

411
0:36:16,118 --> 0:36:17,862
Today you were great, Anna.

412
0:36:21,010 --> 0:36:22,531
You made me really happy.

413
0:36:22,631 --> 0:36:24,777
That is probably because I took a nap in the afternoon.

414
0:36:25,105 --> 0:36:29,480
Took a nap? She was sleeping here for three hours as if she were dead.

415
0:36:32,917 --> 0:36:37,136
May I invite you for a dinner?

416
0:36:49,594 --> 0:36:51,468
Oh my God...

417
0:36:51,908 --> 0:36:55,439
I'll make seven pieces of him!

418
0:36:58,294 --> 0:37:0,626
Why did you try do make fire?

419
0:37:1,511 --> 0:37:3,546
I just wanted to make toast for you.

420
0:37:3,947 --> 0:37:7,112
It's already burning! You can rely on me.

421
0:37:7,385 --> 0:37:11,236
You can rely on me, too. Do I need my belt for you?

422
0:37:11,305 --> 0:37:14,786
Look. I borrowed these boots for you.

423
0:37:14,965 --> 0:37:17,995
Yours are good for dancing lessons, at best.

424
0:37:20,341 --> 0:37:24,285
Lubos, how does a man become a real climber?

425
0:37:24,385 --> 0:37:26,349
When he climbs his first hill.

426
0:37:26,449 --> 0:37:27,546
Which one?

427
0:37:28,119 --> 0:37:33,563
That's not important. When you like it, you're going to be climber for a whole life!

428
0:37:33,865 --> 0:37:39,569
You must have a will of iron and you have to know how to make decisions!

429
0:37:39,620 --> 0:37:40,658
Like what?

430
0:37:40,758 --> 0:37:46,952
Where to put your hands, your legs, how to keep warm.

431
0:37:47,352 --> 0:37:51,062
That's simple. You make a mistake and you're dead.

432
0:37:52,539 --> 0:37:55,347
I don't know... I'm sure my dad didn't make a mistake!

433
0:37:55,447 --> 0:38:3,476
I meant it another way.
A proper man is the most happy when he can overcome obstacles.

434
0:38:3,576 --> 0:38:7,977
My dad was proper! Strong! One head taller than you.

435
0:38:8,077 --> 0:38:13,233
Of course. The best man goes always the last in a line.

436
0:38:13,995 --> 0:38:15,462
You were never afraid?

437
0:38:15,562 --> 0:38:24,236
When you want to win, to beat a 8,000 m high mountain, which has been there for millions of years, you must have courage.

438
0:38:24,336 --> 0:38:25,301
So you weren't afraid.

439
0:38:25,402 --> 0:38:26,966
I was afraid.

440
0:38:27,416 --> 0:38:31,442
The wind in Himalayas sounds like an oncoming train!

441
0:38:31,773 --> 0:38:33,544
Once it made me cry.

442
0:38:33,644 --> 0:38:36,188
My dad was also in Himalayas.

443
0:38:36,288 --> 0:38:38,106
Why didn't you turn back?

444
0:38:38,206 --> 0:38:40,865
At night? We couldn't see.

445
0:38:40,966 --> 0:38:42,150
And in the morning?

446
0:38:42,250 --> 0:38:44,160
We started getting to the peak.

447
0:38:44,260 --> 0:38:45,693
You managed it?

448
0:38:46,737 --> 0:38:49,664
It was the happiest day in my life.

449
0:38:50,064 --> 0:38:56,411
The sun rose. There was silence. Only rocks and ice.

450
0:38:56,953 --> 0:38:59,760
You stand there and feel like God.

451
0:38:59,860 --> 0:39:3,482
I'm also going to be a little God! But Mom can't know that!

452
0:39:3,582 --> 0:39:6,369
A lot of people think that every climber is crazy.

453
0:39:6,558 --> 0:39:7,908
I'm crazy.

454
0:39:8,744 --> 0:39:12,138
I can see that. You're putting salt into your tea!

455
0:39:12,269 --> 0:39:15,740
Hold tight! Hold tight! Hold tight!

456
0:39:20,452 --> 0:39:24,532
One and two, one and two, one and two...

457
0:39:24,733 --> 0:39:34,541
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...

458
0:40:49,406 --> 0:40:51,432
I went to see a lawyer.

459
0:40:52,010 --> 0:40:54,539
You're buying or selling something?

460
0:40:54,585 --> 0:40:56,408
A divorce lawyer.

461
0:40:57,492 --> 0:41:3,331
What if the two of us tried it, according to the rules?

462
0:41:3,958 --> 0:41:7,501
I just don't know if I'll get used to Vasek.

463
0:41:34,916 --> 0:41:35,577
Do you know how to pull a whale's tooth?

464
0:41:36,066 --> 0:41:47,341
You get a sea crane, you give a wagonload of anesthetic to a whale, you prepare dynamite, 3, 2, 1, boom!

465
0:41:50,036 --> 0:41:51,860
What are you laughing at?

466
0:41:51,961 --> 0:41:55,014
I've never kissed a guy.

467
0:41:55,691 --> 0:41:59,068
How so? You didn't like your dad?

468
0:41:59,416 --> 0:42:2,205
I did! But I've never actually met him.

469
0:42:3,166 --> 0:42:8,498
~ Listen, friend, aren't you a little liar, by any chance?
~ A big one!

470
0:42:8,899 --> 0:42:12,866
Your dad was one head taller than me in the morning and now you don't even know him?

471
0:42:12,966 --> 0:42:15,663
In that time I was little like this.

472
0:42:17,476 --> 0:42:19,321
Mommy didn't get married again?

473
0:42:19,421 --> 0:42:25,206
No. I'd also like to have a daddy. Standa has already a third one.

474
0:42:25,828 --> 0:42:31,902
Mommy probably loved daddy a lot. When somebody loves somebody, he can't forget her.

475
0:42:32,002 --> 0:42:36,492
You'd be surprised how angry she is when I draw Annapurna.

476
0:42:38,098 --> 0:42:39,658
Your daddy was at Annapurna?

477
0:42:40,006 --> 0:42:42,549
Of course. His grave's there.

478
0:42:43,931 --> 0:42:45,405
I was also at Annapurna.

479
0:42:45,505 --> 0:42:47,244
With my daddy?

480
0:42:48,075 --> 0:42:50,046
No, of us, all returned home.

481
0:42:50,311 --> 0:42:54,908
My daddy was in the special expedition. They examined the soil under the icecap.

482
0:42:59,541 --> 0:43:0,963
Look, I'm a great dressmaker.

483
0:43:1,448 --> 0:43:8,431
Wait, wait, wait. You want to claim that your daddy was in expedition Annapurna with special geologic program?

484
0:43:8,531 --> 0:43:9,824
Of course.

485
0:43:9,924 --> 0:43:11,167
And when was it?

486
0:43:11,267 --> 0:43:13,160
When I was little like this.

487
0:43:13,260 --> 0:43:16,918
Vasek, Vasek, what are you playing at?

488
0:43:17,018 --> 0:43:20,205
You were little like this and you remember that your dad had shoulders like this?

489
0:43:20,483 --> 0:43:22,262
I have a photo at home.

490
0:43:22,611 --> 0:43:24,954
And you've never seen your dad?

491
0:43:25,054 --> 0:43:27,667
I'm telling you, that I was little like this.

492
0:43:27,767 --> 0:43:29,739
And what is it, little like this? What is it?

493
0:43:29,839 --> 0:43:32,230
When I was in my mommy's belly!

494
0:43:34,706 --> 0:43:35,390
You're 8 years old?

495
0:43:35,490 --> 0:43:36,266
Yes.

496
0:43:38,815 --> 0:43:42,066
And you were born in... September?

497
0:43:42,270 --> 0:43:44,310
Damn it, you're a psychic.

498
0:44:9,118 --> 0:44:10,860
What are you doing?

499
0:44:15,156 --> 0:44:17,264
I'm checking how much snow there's going to be tomorrow.

500
0:44:22,527 --> 0:44:25,320
You don't have to repeat every silly thing I do.

501
0:45:14,456 --> 0:45:19,081
Vasek, what would you say if I tried dating your mommy?

502
0:45:19,605 --> 0:45:21,512
You would try it?

503
0:45:22,595 --> 0:45:25,302
Would I try it... I will *do* it!

504
0:45:27,357 --> 0:45:28,753
You like my mom?

505
0:45:29,986 --> 0:45:33,308
~ I like YOU!
~ I like you, too!

506
0:45:43,803 --> 0:45:46,277
~ Lubos, you must be careful!
~ About what?

507
0:45:46,688 --> 0:45:53,064
That trying! Mom doesn't want to hear a word about marriage. She's nearly beaten me!

508
0:45:53,961 --> 0:45:55,892
I'll do what I can.

509
0:46:1,457 --> 0:46:3,984
~ Vasek!
~ Mommy!

510
0:46:32,938 --> 0:46:34,121
What are you doing?

511
0:46:34,506 --> 0:46:36,380
We arranged that, didn't we?

512
0:46:36,480 --> 0:46:39,652
Yes, but kissing was Lubos's idea!

513
0:47:38,862 --> 0:47:41,369
Stand up, lazy people! Stand up!

514
0:47:47,589 --> 0:47:51,649
~ One, two, one, two...
~ One, two, one, two...

515
0:48:3,348 --> 0:48:6,986
The boy skis great, what do you think?

516
0:48:15,162 --> 0:48:23,094
Knees bent...swivel those hips...go on...!

517
0:48:25,297 --> 0:48:29,100
Keep your knees together! Stop!

518
0:48:45,751 --> 0:48:49,618
Anna, when did we date each other?

519
0:48:50,328 --> 0:48:53,203
You know, I really can't remember...

520
0:48:53,820 --> 0:48:56,245
I think we could figure it out.

521
0:48:57,655 --> 0:49:0,309
You were at the conservatory.

522
0:49:0,807 --> 0:49:3,248
It's not important today, anyway.

523
0:49:4,622 --> 0:49:7,470
And wasn't it before I went to Annapurna?

524
0:49:11,483 --> 0:49:13,493
I really don't know.

525
0:49:13,593 --> 0:49:15,535
If you think...

526
0:49:15,635 --> 0:49:20,627
It only seems to me that Vasek wants to look like me.

527
0:49:21,687 --> 0:49:23,760
As if I were his daddy.

528
0:49:25,237 --> 0:49:27,939
Well, it probably only seems like that.

529
0:49:28,171 --> 0:49:29,217
Probably.

530
0:49:29,593 --> 0:49:34,354
Vasek wants to look like everybody. It was a school caretaker last time.

531
0:49:34,454 --> 0:49:38,968
But a school caretaker isn't a climber.

532
0:49:40,034 --> 0:49:42,129
Buried under an avalanche.

533
0:49:44,138 --> 0:49:46,548
To our last evening.

534
0:49:47,232 --> 0:49:48,966
Why did you take me here?

535
0:49:50,059 --> 0:49:53,668
I was thinking it's a really long time since you've been dancing.

536
0:49:57,000 --> 0:49:58,204
Everything is like old times.

537
0:49:58,305 --> 0:50:1,128
No. Nothing can be repeated.

538
0:50:6,673 --> 0:50:11,682
I'm leaving for the Alps in a month. Before that I'm going to be in Prague for a few days.

539
0:50:11,782 --> 0:50:14,348
Think about the "date" until that time.

540
0:50:15,883 --> 0:50:17,101
What date?

541
0:50:17,617 --> 0:50:22,296
You arranged me a funeral --- I'm going to arrange you a wedding.

542
0:50:22,397 --> 0:50:24,451
Wait, whom am I going to marry?

543
0:50:24,788 --> 0:50:26,700
Me, of course.

544
0:50:29,303 --> 0:50:30,905
You're getting divorced?

545
0:50:31,061 --> 0:50:31,061
I haven't ever gotten married.

546
0:50:32,916 --> 0:50:37,327
I haven't told you yet? I have such a miserable memory...

547
0:50:37,528 --> 0:50:39,330
I can't even remember the size of my shirt.

548
0:50:41,791 --> 0:50:44,850
Do you remember that we were here back then?

549
0:50:44,950 --> 0:50:48,744
Nine years ago, this was the only place with a music box.

550
0:50:52,711 --> 0:50:57,730
Do you remember about our bet that you would bring me flowers in 10 minutes?

551
0:50:58,218 --> 0:50:59,579
And I lost.

552
0:51:0,808 --> 0:51:4,648
No. Mountain rescue called about emergency situation.

553
0:51:4,883 --> 0:51:7,383
A man lost in Ob¿í D¿l.

554
0:51:7,824 --> 0:51:11,123
I'm glad that you remember the details.

555
0:51:11,471 --> 0:51:15,993
You rescued that man. You returned after midnight.

556
0:51:18,596 --> 0:51:21,599
Why didn't you get married?

557
0:51:21,957 --> 0:51:24,280
And why didn't *you* get married?

558
0:51:25,430 --> 0:51:28,441
I've always been more attracted by mountains.

559
0:51:30,120 --> 0:51:31,729
And what about now?

560
0:51:32,750 --> 0:51:35,544
Now I'm not strong enough for the hills.

561
0:51:36,636 --> 0:51:38,987
By that you mean you'd be strong enough for me.

562
0:51:39,203 --> 0:51:41,894
No. For our boy.

563
0:51:49,655 --> 0:51:51,422
You don't have to tell me anything.

564
0:51:51,987 --> 0:51:54,725
I won't reproach you. We'd known each other for fourteen days.

565
0:51:55,433 --> 0:51:56,258
Nine days.

566
0:51:56,775 --> 0:52:0,439
You were dating somebody. And I was in the way.

567
0:52:0,766 --> 0:52:2,546
And what have you been doing for that eight years?

568
0:52:2,646 --> 0:52:2,646
Whom did you want to marry anyway?

569
0:52:5,430 --> 0:52:7,047
Vasek is not your son.

570
0:52:7,540 --> 0:52:10,224
You are lying. We met here. In December.

571
0:52:10,324 --> 0:52:13,187
I went to Himalayas in January. And the boy was born in September.

572
0:52:13,460 --> 0:52:16,019
We returned from expedition in November. All of us.

573
0:52:16,273 --> 0:52:21,379
~ Nobody stayed on Annapurna under an avalanche.
~ I hope you won't be so stupid as to tell Vasek.

574
0:52:21,479 --> 0:52:26,377
If this is your decision --- you can rely on me.

575
0:52:30,767 --> 0:52:34,676
I was so happy with my friends that I didn't realize I was living alone.

576
0:52:35,949 --> 0:52:41,553
For example, this Christmas. There were a lot of people around me but no "my" person.

577
0:52:42,676 --> 0:52:45,903
And as I started thinking about it,
such a primo boy appears.

578
0:52:46,307 --> 0:52:48,044
And on top of that --- he's mine.

579
0:52:48,329 --> 0:52:51,788
Anna. Tell me. I'm begging you...

580
0:52:52,205 --> 0:52:54,103
Tell me he's mine.

581
0:52:54,526 --> 0:52:56,886
Please, don't be crazy.

582
0:53:0,264 --> 0:53:3,089
I hoped I wouldn't meet you ever again.

583
0:53:3,607 --> 0:53:9,809
If somebody is in my way today, I'll put him in the sack and I'll throw into the river!

584
0:53:12,507 --> 0:53:18,307
You can guess, you can count, but you don't have a single proof that Vasek is yours.

585
0:53:18,407 --> 0:53:19,245
I do.

586
0:53:22,157 --> 0:53:24,819
He's as amazing as me!

587
0:54:6,852 --> 0:54:8,057
Where were you running?

588
0:54:8,158 --> 0:54:10,309
To the train station. Lubos is coming today!

589
0:54:10,409 --> 0:54:11,134
Which Lubos?

590
0:54:11,234 --> 0:54:12,300
My daddy!

591
0:54:12,400 --> 0:54:13,420
A spare one.

592
0:54:14,197 --> 0:54:16,251
So Mom found somebody, after all?

593
0:54:16,351 --> 0:54:18,497
No. I found him by myself!

594
0:54:18,597 --> 0:54:20,451
He wrote nine letters to him!

595
0:54:21,728 --> 0:54:22,942
What is he like?

596
0:54:23,042 --> 0:54:26,676
A big one. A chief of a mountain rescue service.

597
0:54:29,335 --> 0:54:35,319
Mom has a first rehearsal today. We have to wait outside.

598
0:54:35,885 --> 0:54:37,227
Let's go inside then!

599
0:54:51,037 --> 0:54:52,426
This is Mom?

600
0:54:54,517 --> 0:54:57,079
Damn it, she's got steam!

601
0:55:24,222 --> 0:55:26,326
We're going to sleep in the same room.

602
0:55:30,626 --> 0:55:32,489
And who's the guy?

603
0:55:32,589 --> 0:55:34,974
Uncle Jindrich.

604
0:55:48,262 --> 0:55:53,402
I don't like him! He's not friendly and he doesn't like dogs.

605
0:55:58,139 --> 0:56:2,590
Then we'll put him in the sack and we'll throw him into the river.

606
0:56:6,153 --> 0:56:7,180
Enough!

607
0:56:7,656 --> 0:56:8,856
This is Annapurna.

608
0:56:9,161 --> 0:56:10,001
And up there?

609
0:56:10,362 --> 0:56:12,650
Also Annapurna. Also Annapurna.

610
0:56:13,258 --> 0:56:17,768
I screwed this one up. This was in December. This was when I was 5.

611
0:56:18,114 --> 0:56:20,703
And why is there a Christmas tree and those presents?

612
0:56:20,803 --> 0:56:24,703
For my daddy, of course. So that he's not alone on Christmas.

613
0:56:33,936 --> 0:56:35,641
~ I'll take you with me.
~ Really?

614
0:56:36,086 --> 0:56:37,312
When you are adult.

615
0:56:38,384 --> 0:56:40,757
~ Do you have that photo?
~ It's hidden away.

616
0:56:40,857 --> 0:56:43,606
Then show it to me.

617
0:56:51,473 --> 0:56:53,048
I don't want Mommy to steal it.

618
0:57:1,284 --> 0:57:2,906
Let me guess, will you?

619
0:57:8,166 --> 0:57:9,511
Am I right?

620
0:57:10,076 --> 0:57:12,150
You knew my daddy?

621
0:57:12,683 --> 0:57:13,855
Are you able to be silent?

622
0:57:13,955 --> 0:57:16,041
In front of your mom?

623
0:57:17,296 --> 0:57:19,379
This is me.

624
0:57:19,840 --> 0:57:22,937
It's not you! It's my dad!

625
0:57:23,430 --> 0:57:27,480
It's your dad, but it's also me!

626
0:57:27,580 --> 0:57:28,621
What does that mean?

627
0:57:28,722 --> 0:57:30,015
I don't know!

628
0:57:31,706 --> 0:57:33,206
That I'm your dad.

629
0:57:33,607 --> 0:57:35,537
That's not true!

630
0:57:35,637 --> 0:57:38,003
It's not you! It's my dad!

631
0:57:38,103 --> 0:57:39,713
Why couldn't it be me?

632
0:57:39,813 --> 0:57:42,455
My dad is dead! A hero!

633
0:57:42,555 --> 0:57:43,838
What are you doing here?

634
0:57:43,938 --> 0:57:45,273
Lubos is lying.

635
0:57:45,728 --> 0:57:50,300
Anna, please, don't be mad with me. I told him.

636
0:57:51,155 --> 0:57:55,492
You are egotistical. Idiot!

637
0:58:0,678 --> 0:58:2,207
Do you have a knife?

638
0:58:7,239 --> 0:58:10,341
I've been collecting these cars for five years.

639
0:58:13,157 --> 0:58:17,008
All of them are yours now.

640
0:58:27,814 --> 0:58:31,565
You mustn't take him seriously, Mom. He's a liar.

641
0:58:32,065 --> 0:58:35,592
And don't swear at him. He's going to have dinner with us.

642
0:58:37,813 --> 0:58:38,955
I'll help you.

643
0:58:39,055 --> 0:58:40,502
Me too.

644
0:58:52,403 --> 0:58:55,453
Mommy, how come Lubos knew my dad?

645
0:58:57,715 --> 0:58:58,455
I didn't know him.

646
0:58:58,555 --> 0:59:0,006
Why is he lying?

647
0:59:0,106 --> 0:59:4,711
You pointed at him. Were you his friend?

648
0:59:9,079 --> 0:59:10,817
I don't know.

649
0:59:11,280 --> 0:59:15,171
But I know! You left him under the avalanche!

650
0:59:15,308 --> 0:59:16,693
Damn it!

651
0:59:18,297 --> 0:59:20,202
Say something, Anna.

652
0:59:20,752 --> 0:59:23,067
Leave me alone. Both of you.

653
0:59:28,621 --> 0:59:30,160
I'll tell you something.

654
0:59:31,189 --> 0:59:36,665
If my dad were alive, he would be
at home with me every evening.

655
0:59:37,254 --> 0:59:39,627
He would go to the cinema with me.

656
0:59:39,727 --> 0:59:41,608
And we would have a dog.

657
0:59:41,708 --> 0:59:44,583
But your dad didn't know that you existed.

658
0:59:44,683 --> 0:59:46,009
If he knew, he would visit you.

659
0:59:46,148 --> 0:59:51,032
And why didn't he visit Mom? He knew she exists.

660
0:59:51,728 --> 0:59:54,329
Mom, is he my dad?

661
0:59:56,691 --> 1:0:0,870
~ Is he or not?
~ Give me a break.
~ I want to know!

662
1:0:2,295 --> 1:0:5,546
Yes, this is your dad.

663
1:0:13,664 --> 1:0:17,043
You screwed it up. Everything.

664
1:0:18,385 --> 1:0:22,139
Let Mom be! Go away!

665
1:0:37,435 --> 1:0:39,672
Mommy, don't cry.

666
1:0:40,328 --> 1:0:42,289
He's already gone.

667
1:0:43,095 --> 1:0:46,167
You've got me. I'm going to be with you.

668
1:0:46,267 --> 1:0:49,237
Until we die. Every day.

669
1:1:15,551 --> 1:1:18,410
Look, my dad is as accurate as a clock.

670
1:1:29,223 --> 1:1:31,223
Your mother called.

671
1:1:32,705 --> 1:1:34,906
She arranged a meeting with me.

672
1:1:35,643 --> 1:1:36,529
Tomorrow.

673
1:1:37,330 --> 1:1:39,160
Do you know what she could want to tell me?

674
1:1:39,260 --> 1:1:41,775
I can imagine what. To make you get divorced.

675
1:1:42,504 --> 1:1:44,009
And you don't want me to?

676
1:1:47,364 --> 1:1:50,329
I haven't been wishing anything else for four years.

677
1:1:54,106 --> 1:1:58,380
Maybe it would still be worth it. To talk about us.

678
1:2:1,833 --> 1:2:4,953
You should have gone to meet Vasek. Not me.

679
1:2:5,053 --> 1:2:7,143
I've been waiting in front of the school for an hour.

680
1:2:7,626 --> 1:2:8,827
So?

681
1:2:12,730 --> 1:2:14,186
Nothing.

682
1:2:14,668 --> 1:2:16,422
Why didn't you listen to me?

683
1:2:17,664 --> 1:2:20,204
I knew Vasek would never understand.

684
1:2:20,502 --> 1:2:23,808
Can I visit you?

685
1:2:24,106 --> 1:2:27,239
At 4? At 5?

686
1:2:28,416 --> 1:2:30,372
You aren't interested in who it was?

687
1:2:30,700 --> 1:2:31,910
I'll come in the evening.

688
1:2:33,160 --> 1:2:35,100
I don't even know you!

689
1:2:36,159 --> 1:2:37,451
You don't know anything about me either...

690
1:2:37,551 --> 1:2:39,486
And you made Vasek think we're going to live together.

691
1:2:39,779 --> 1:2:40,861
I'm afraid he doesn't want to talk to me.

692
1:2:41,265 --> 1:2:43,355
You could have written a word at least.

693
1:2:43,557 --> 1:2:46,288
I read about your return from Himalayas in the newspapers.

694
1:2:48,302 --> 1:2:50,167
Why didn't you write you were pregnant then?

695
1:2:50,456 --> 1:2:53,588
Where? To Asia? Camp number 4?

696
1:2:53,933 --> 1:2:55,142
I returned.

697
1:2:56,009 --> 1:2:58,494
The boy was nearly three months old.

698
1:2:58,594 --> 1:3:1,077
Why did you want Vasek never to know me?

699
1:3:3,246 --> 1:3:5,392
What did I do to you?

700
1:3:8,388 --> 1:3:15,465
I... I was kind of proud to be pregnant with you.

701
1:3:16,521 --> 1:3:20,908
I thought you were hero, when you rescued that man in Ob¿í D¿l.

702
1:3:22,111 --> 1:3:31,787
I thought... I thought you were going to be happy when you return and see us.

703
1:3:32,325 --> 1:3:34,608
That I'm as brave as you.

704
1:3:34,978 --> 1:3:37,892
That I kept the baby, against everyone.

705
1:3:42,657 --> 1:3:46,474
But if you'd written the boy was born...

706
1:3:47,332 --> 1:3:53,825
You didn't even remember me and you'd be so happy to have a baby?

707
1:3:56,148 --> 1:3:57,541
When are you leaving?

708
1:3:59,692 --> 1:4:1,517
In four days.

709
1:4:4,662 --> 1:4:8,908
Vasek needs time to get over it.

710
1:4:11,087 --> 1:4:14,797
If children could understand everything,
they wouldn't be children.

711
1:4:15,991 --> 1:4:22,828
Because there are more differences between children and adults than just size.

712
1:4:23,543 --> 1:4:25,336
It was also my fault.

713
1:4:25,761 --> 1:4:26,946
It wasn't.

714
1:4:29,171 --> 1:4:33,111
Vasík, did you want a dad? You did.

715
1:4:33,400 --> 1:4:37,382
You liked Lubos. You said he was a friend.

716
1:4:37,483 --> 1:4:43,164
He isn't, Mom. I cried for him while he was in the mountains with other boys.

717
1:4:43,264 --> 1:4:46,176
Lubos didn't know about you. You must trust me!

718
1:4:46,276 --> 1:4:48,668
He cheated me. He lied to me in the mountains already.

719
1:4:48,813 --> 1:4:53,289
He pretended to try dating you, and you were married a long time ago.

720
1:4:54,320 --> 1:4:55,817
No, we didn't.

721
1:4:57,346 --> 1:5:1,738
When I was young, I believed you when you said you bought me in a shop.

722
1:5:1,838 --> 1:5:5,373
But now I'm old enough to know how babies are born.

723
1:5:5,473 --> 1:5:6,483
Really?

724
1:5:6,835 --> 1:5:8,718
After marriage.

725
1:5:12,196 --> 1:5:17,650
Well... marriage isn't the main thing.

726
1:5:18,059 --> 1:5:19,473
It can happen when people love each other.

727
1:5:20,955 --> 1:5:27,121
If he loved you, Mom, he would visit us on Saturdays or when it's my birthday.

728
1:5:27,221 --> 1:5:30,063
You are stubborn just like your little tooth.

729
1:5:30,497 --> 1:5:33,242
We've been persuading it for two hours but it doesn't give in.

730
1:5:33,907 --> 1:5:37,900
But when it grows up, it won't hurt anymore, will it?

731
1:5:43,019 --> 1:5:45,098
Lubos will be waiting for you tomorrow in front of the school.

732
1:5:45,198 --> 1:5:47,570
I'm not going there anyway.

733
1:6:14,269 --> 1:6:18,370
Hello --- I told him.

734
1:6:19,015 --> 1:6:20,615
I did what I could.

735
1:6:21,929 --> 1:6:25,440
It depends on you.

736
1:6:26,451 --> 1:6:27,803
I'm going to gargle.

737
1:6:31,559 --> 1:6:35,986
Vasík, you are a goon. Such beautiful pictures... Why did you destroy them?

738
1:6:36,123 --> 1:6:38,479
I'll never be a climber anymore.

739
1:7:23,460 --> 1:7:29,178
You've got a primo bike. You're good at it.

740
1:7:30,184 --> 1:7:38,144
I've bought new climbing equipment, ropes, crampons.
I have it in my hotel. Do you want to have a look?

741
1:7:38,464 --> 1:7:40,706
I've brought you something.

742
1:7:51,596 --> 1:7:52,567
Do you like him?

743
1:7:52,667 --> 1:7:54,113
I'm not allowed to bring home strange dogs.

744
1:7:54,213 --> 1:7:58,114
He's not a strange dog. He's Ben. Keep him. He's yours.

745
1:7:58,579 --> 1:8:1,121
And what about Mom? Won't she beat me?

746
1:8:1,221 --> 1:8:3,559
Don't worry. She'll be happy.

747
1:8:3,872 --> 1:8:6,683
You're lying! And you're teaching Mom to lie.

748
1:8:8,629 --> 1:8:11,198
You plot against me over the phone.

749
1:8:29,402 --> 1:8:36,993
I let you go to the mountains so I wouldn't lose you and you forget me in one day there.

750
1:8:37,329 --> 1:8:39,500
It's quite funny, actually.

751
1:8:44,209 --> 1:8:48,764
When a man is afraid, he's about to lose.

752
1:9:30,007 --> 1:9:32,229
You really want to go to a hospital?

753
1:9:32,329 --> 1:9:36,536
No. Your mother invited me to your place.

754
1:9:37,970 --> 1:9:40,670
I would have to know that, wouldn't I?

755
1:9:40,770 --> 1:9:42,339
You won't invite me upstairs?

756
1:9:46,529 --> 1:9:49,498
You shouldn't have gone with me at all.

757
1:10:0,541 --> 1:10:4,937
Anna, would you mind Vasek having a dog?

758
1:10:7,690 --> 1:10:9,381
No way.

759
1:10:9,718 --> 1:10:14,322
That's a disaster... Don't worry! I'll fix it!

760
1:10:16,669 --> 1:10:19,661
Leave me alone. Both of you!

761
1:10:30,068 --> 1:10:30,861
Where is he?

762
1:10:31,118 --> 1:10:32,903
Who? Vasek or that dog?

763
1:10:33,506 --> 1:10:35,445
Jindrich, of course!

764
1:10:43,131 --> 1:10:48,288
You've gone crazy. All of you.

765
1:10:55,888 --> 1:10:58,286
Mommy, are you glad that we have Beník?

766
1:10:58,598 --> 1:11:0,112
Of course.

767
1:11:0,770 --> 1:11:2,883
Go to wash. Don't play.

768
1:11:2,932 --> 1:11:5,631
Come, Beník, we'll make a beautiful dog out of you.

769
1:11:6,391 --> 1:11:10,244
Lubos has a dad in Kamenice. They have rabbits.

770
1:11:10,613 --> 1:11:15,656
Also a cat. A pig. You would have a grandpa.

771
1:11:16,766 --> 1:11:18,951
You always wanted a grandpa, didn't you?

772
1:11:20,726 --> 1:11:24,166
Enough. Everybody can screw up something nice.

773
1:11:24,504 --> 1:11:28,314
Either me or Lubos. But you're a primo boy.

774
1:11:28,414 --> 1:11:31,873
And it was quite good idea with those toothbrushes!

775
1:11:32,808 --> 1:11:38,293
~ There should be three people in every family.
~ We are three: you, me, and the dog.

776
1:11:41,697 --> 1:11:45,300
The last dress rehearsal! Three minutes! Soloists on stage!

777
1:11:47,603 --> 1:11:51,606
Let's go for it, folks! Make it fun!

778
1:11:52,708 --> 1:11:56,611
Spartacus will be stabbed, and Fergie raises the sword!

779
1:12:3,937 --> 1:12:4,809
What's up?

780
1:12:5,031 --> 1:12:7,010
Today I've been waiting for two hours.

781
1:12:8,451 --> 1:12:13,976
~ I can't force Vasek to talk to you.
~ Soloists -- Spartacus, Fergie, on the stage, please!

782
1:12:15,605 --> 1:12:19,647
He didn't even show up. He's trickier than an 8000m mountain.

783
1:12:20,625 --> 1:12:22,593
Anna, I can't take it anymore.

784
1:12:23,369 --> 1:12:26,341
Vasek was waiting for you for eight years and you can't take it for a few days?

785
1:12:26,441 --> 1:12:29,171
~ But I'm leaving tomorrow!
~ Fergie, Fergie! On stage!

786
1:12:29,968 --> 1:12:32,564
What if you let the mountains be.

787
1:12:32,664 --> 1:12:34,906
I can't leave the whole expedition in trouble.

788
1:12:35,243 --> 1:12:37,600
You always rush in just like an avalanche.

789
1:12:37,700 --> 1:12:40,039
You made me a grave, Anna! I wouldn't do that...

790
1:12:40,714 --> 1:12:44,543
I wouldn't be able to read in the newspaper that somebody is alive and make him a funeral.

791
1:12:44,643 --> 1:12:47,871
And what was I supposed to tell Vasek when he started asking about his dad?

792
1:12:48,128 --> 1:12:52,161
You waited for me one more year, before he started to talk?

793
1:12:52,841 --> 1:12:56,084
Three more years before he started to think.

794
1:12:57,887 --> 1:13:0,321
If there was an idiot in this world, it was me.

795
1:13:0,421 --> 1:13:3,095
You don't need to apologize. I don't care about you today.

796
1:13:3,195 --> 1:13:8,369
Don't say that... There's our 8-year-old boy to be stubborn.

797
1:13:8,914 --> 1:13:11,075
Aniczka, you must go!

798
1:13:25,607 --> 1:13:27,693
A moment, a moment. Visitors' day is Wednesday!

799
1:13:27,793 --> 1:13:29,027
My wife's here.

800
1:13:33,294 --> 1:13:34,575
Vasek's got lost.

801
1:13:34,840 --> 1:13:35,725
What are you on about now?

802
1:13:35,825 --> 1:13:39,249
When I rang and told him about your broken leg, he just went crazy.

803
1:13:39,664 --> 1:13:42,117
Before I packed your stuff up, he was gone.

804
1:13:42,217 --> 1:13:44,040
I've been looking for him for an hour.

805
1:13:44,140 --> 1:13:46,793
Please, don't panic, now he's already at home.

806
1:13:46,946 --> 1:13:48,578
He's been already here?

807
1:13:50,293 --> 1:13:53,911
There are many hospitals in Prague and he found the right one.

808
1:13:55,113 --> 1:13:57,447
We have a clever child, don't we?

809
1:13:58,490 --> 1:14:0,336
Why is she staring at us?

810
1:14:0,436 --> 1:14:2,326
She's my mother.

811
1:14:3,399 --> 1:14:9,524
Look after his homework and put the keys into the mailbox before you leave.

812
1:14:11,284 --> 1:14:12,580
Go.

813
1:14:18,744 --> 1:14:24,558
What a behavior! So you have a child together?! Then explain to me...

814
1:14:27,258 --> 1:14:29,202
He was that rascal??

815
1:14:29,947 --> 1:14:33,798
If they don't make peace, I will die...

816
1:14:35,801 --> 1:14:42,807
¤ Radio tells a poetic story about the Himalayas... ¤

817
1:14:53,207 --> 1:14:55,537
Why didn't you tell me about having grandma in the hospital?

818
1:14:56,711 --> 1:14:59,777
Can't you imagine how worried I was about you?

819
1:15:41,250 --> 1:15:42,996
I'll spend the night here.

820
1:15:43,421 --> 1:15:46,062
You don't have to go to Valentas'.

821
1:16:20,173 --> 1:16:21,983
I couldn't come today.

822
1:16:22,320 --> 1:16:23,603
Why not?

823
1:16:23,704 --> 1:16:24,950
I had detention.

824
1:16:25,050 --> 1:16:27,192
A bummer, isn't it?

825
1:16:27,293 --> 1:16:29,803
Mom has to go to school.

826
1:16:29,903 --> 1:16:30,784
And why?

827
1:16:31,402 --> 1:16:33,171
I didn't want to write an essay.

828
1:16:33,605 --> 1:16:37,488
You know what? I'll go to school instead of Mommy.

829
1:16:37,802 --> 1:16:39,842
But you are leaving tomorrow.

830
1:16:40,099 --> 1:16:41,254
I'll stay here with you.

831
1:16:41,354 --> 1:16:41,952
You'll go.

832
1:16:42,052 --> 1:16:48,474
I'll arrange it with Mom. Girls don't know anything about friendship.

833
1:16:48,739 --> 1:16:50,000
And you do?

834
1:16:50,101 --> 1:16:51,391
I do.

835
1:16:52,992 --> 1:16:54,882
I've already written that essay.

836
1:16:56,380 --> 1:16:57,516
"What does my dad do?

837
1:16:58,028 --> 1:17:4,273
"My dad is a chief of mountain rescue. He does what he says. He waits for me in front of the school at 3 o'clock."

838
1:17:4,725 --> 1:17:7,832
"He's reliable. He bought me a dog."

839
1:17:8,201 --> 1:17:13,214
"He's got experience because he's a climber. He climbed a 8000 m high mountain."

840
1:17:13,479 --> 1:17:16,198
"He gets over all obstacles."

841
1:17:16,298 --> 1:17:19,222
"He's a good friend."

842
1:17:28,591 --> 1:17:30,484
Do you know how to pull out a tooth of a kangaroo?

843
1:17:31,006 --> 1:17:35,217
You make a sea crane, you prepare dynamite...

844
1:17:35,482 --> 1:17:37,719
It wasn't a kangaroo, it was a whale!

845
1:17:37,819 --> 1:17:38,745
That's not important.

846
1:17:38,845 --> 1:17:43,506
It is! Because you have to give dynamite to a whale. A kangaroo would visit a dentist.

847
1:17:43,851 --> 1:17:47,014
3, 2, 1!
