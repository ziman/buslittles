¤ HOW TO PULL A WHALE'S TOOTH ¤

2
0:0:45,577 --> 0:0:51,579
Vasek, why is there a bandage around the whale's head?

3
0:0:53,506 --> 0:0:56,715
Because she's got a toothache!

4
0:1:13,416 --> 0:1:16,027
What's up, boys? Don't you want me to give you a lift?

5
0:1:16,127 --> 0:1:16,824
Yes!

6
0:1:18,020 --> 0:1:18,848
You know him?

7
0:1:18,948 --> 0:1:21,233
Of course. He's my daddy!

8
0:1:21,931 --> 0:1:23,056
And which one?

9
0:1:23,417 --> 0:1:25,466
A spare one.

10
0:1:38,544 --> 0:1:43,141
That's impossible. My mom says that every primo man is already married.

11
0:1:43,316 --> 0:1:44,633
You have to know how to search!

12
0:1:45,307 --> 0:1:46,512
Well, just like my mom!

13
0:1:46,938 --> 0:1:51,871
I just wore a tie, introduced myself as a minister,...

14
0:1:51,971 --> 0:1:58,034
we had steaks, Pilsner beer, and now we're friends.

15
0:1:58,461 --> 0:2:1,810
When I grow up, I'll also deliver milk!

16
0:2:1,825 --> 0:2:3,432
I'll also work like my dad.

17
0:2:3,824 --> 0:2:4,948
A climber!

18
0:2:16,479 --> 0:2:17,735
You are already here?

19
0:2:17,835 --> 0:2:18,477
Yes.

20
0:2:19,813 --> 0:2:21,840
I'll examine the exercise books at home,...

21
0:2:21,940 --> 0:2:23,738
he'll get new pajamas...

22
0:2:23,838 --> 0:2:27,380
and make him turn the lights off at 8.

23
0:2:27,673 --> 0:2:29,606
And Carla, no chocolate!

24
0:2:29,797 --> 0:2:31,122
Aniczka, and what about dinner?

25
0:2:31,222 --> 0:2:32,364
I'm going to make it by myself.

26
0:2:33,520 --> 0:2:36,981
Vasek! Vasíczek!

27
0:2:37,271 --> 0:2:39,927
I know that you're at home.

28
0:2:40,204 --> 0:2:44,401
Wow! Somebody washed the dishes here.

29
0:2:44,737 --> 0:2:48,506
Somebody probably wants an ice cream as a reward.

30
0:2:48,774 --> 0:2:50,983
My darling!

31
0:2:53,455 --> 0:2:56,425
So where is my nice little boy?

32
0:2:56,757 --> 0:2:58,658
Boo!

33
0:2:58,784 --> 0:2:59,704
What's that?

34
0:2:59,712 --> 0:3:0,447
It's a dog.

35
0:3:0,547 --> 0:3:3,448
What did you promise to me? That you'll leave all the strange dogs alone.

36
0:3:3,530 --> 0:3:6,891
It's not a strange dog. It's Arnold!

37
0:3:6,977 --> 0:3:8,133
He's able to get the dust out of the duster.

38
0:3:8,233 --> 0:3:8,875
Oh please...

39
0:3:9,176 --> 0:3:11,106
He followed me home. Can I keep him?

40
0:3:11,481 --> 0:3:13,644
And who would take care of him?

41
0:3:13,744 --> 0:3:17,954
You'll take him to Valenta's in the evening? And at night Carla will go with him, won't she?

42
0:3:18,531 --> 0:3:23,821
If my dad was here, neither me nor the dog would have to go to Valenta's.

43
0:3:23,921 --> 0:3:27,396
You just determined you're going to make me upset.

44
0:3:27,749 --> 0:3:31,391
Didn't you promise to me that you wouldn't talk about it?

45
0:3:31,440 --> 0:3:33,443
I'd also like to have a friend.

46
0:3:33,778 --> 0:3:37,469
You'll get a dog. A nicer one.

47
0:3:37,743 --> 0:3:39,295
But when you are older.

48
0:3:39,395 --> 0:3:42,037
He's nice. He is friends with children.

49
0:3:42,410 --> 0:3:43,696
He catches the second league.

50
0:3:43,796 --> 0:3:45,055
Who? The dog?

51
0:3:45,184 --> 0:3:47,819
No. His master. He's primo.

52
0:3:47,846 --> 0:3:48,924
A goalkeeper.

53
0:3:49,235 --> 0:3:51,261
Please, what are you talking about? Which goalkeeper?

54
0:3:51,401 --> 0:3:55,037
Our school caretaker. You're definitely going to like him!

55
0:3:55,495 --> 0:3:57,678
Why would I be supposed to like him?

56
0:3:57,784 --> 0:3:59,289
Because he's not married.

57
0:4:0,744 --> 0:4:5,599
Listen to me: you'll return that dog immediately and I don't want to hear a word about marriage.

58
0:5:21,569 --> 0:5:22,623
Damn it, I'm going to have a bruise again!

59
0:5:22,767 --> 0:5:28,805
Paris is a boor. But Julie should be gentle.

60
0:5:28,833 --> 0:5:33,358
But it wasn't Paris, but that idiot Romeo.

61
0:5:33,458 --> 0:5:34,400
Thanks.

62
0:6:11,346 --> 0:6:13,042
On Sunday again.

63
0:6:13,142 --> 0:6:15,368
The third time this month.

64
0:6:15,468 --> 0:6:19,111
When the troupe from Warsaw comes, you're going to have holiday for a whole week!

65
0:6:19,211 --> 0:6:21,546
And what about rehearsals?

66
0:6:22,803 --> 0:6:26,171
Don't you really want to go somewhere to have a dinner?

67
0:6:30,736 --> 0:6:35,067
Vasek decided that we need somebody at home.

68
0:6:35,182 --> 0:6:37,899
How so? You explained it to him.

69
0:6:38,028 --> 0:6:39,593
I thought it was over.

70
0:6:39,929 --> 0:6:46,104
It was. Until his friend's mother got remarried.

71
0:6:48,113 --> 0:6:53,616
Vasek's going to get over it. When he's older, he'll have other problems.

72
0:6:53,711 --> 0:6:57,753
What if he doesn't get over it?

73
0:6:59,785 --> 0:7:5,114
I hope you're not going to blame me. After four years.

74
0:7:5,526 --> 0:7:9,004
You can't let Vasek talk into your private business.

75
0:7:9,104 --> 0:7:11,636
I've already forbidden him to talk about marriage.

76
0:7:11,681 --> 0:7:12,947
That's right.

77
0:7:14,172 --> 0:7:15,455
It's even worse.

78
0:7:16,282 --> 0:7:22,009
Yesterday he put the third bowl with a toothbrush on the shelf in the bathroom.

79
0:7:22,044 --> 0:7:24,823
You overreact to everything.

80
0:7:30,057 --> 0:7:32,998
I'll wait for you, shouldn't I?

81
0:7:34,079 --> 0:7:36,296
I told you: it's not possible.

82
0:7:36,396 --> 0:7:37,704
Vasek is at Valenta's?

83
0:7:37,866 --> 0:7:39,818
No, Carla is at our place.

84
0:7:40,610 --> 0:7:44,832
The last you had free time was 10 days ago.

85
0:8:5,277 --> 0:8:8,886
If you want to, come upstairs.

86
0:8:10,971 --> 0:8:16,904
You are really able to make it easier for me...

87
0:8:31,130 --> 0:8:33,362
I have some free time next Sunday.

88
0:8:33,489 --> 0:8:37,916
We'll go to the cinema to watch funnies. Do you want to?

89
0:8:37,951 --> 0:8:41,932
Or you can invite Standa over and you can play with cars.

90
0:8:41,967 --> 0:8:46,417
Standa can't come now. Now he drives around with his new daddy with milk.

91
0:8:46,517 --> 0:8:49,461
He's got rabbits! And also a new grandpa.

92
0:8:49,626 --> 0:8:53,824
Mommy... I'd also like a grandpa. At least one.

93
0:8:54,210 --> 0:8:56,521
Tell me rather, where you were yesterday when you pulled your trousers apart.

94
0:8:56,803 --> 0:8:58,386
I was tracking.

95
0:8:59,283 --> 0:9:0,423
A dog again?

96
0:9:0,708 --> 0:9:3,075
No, a sports teacher.

97
0:9:6,367 --> 0:9:7,717
Vasek?!

98
0:9:8,503 --> 0:9:10,925
I'm detective Colombo. He's not married!

99
0:9:11,088 --> 0:9:14,472
You know what, Colombo? I'll really give you a few slaps!

100
0:9:14,606 --> 0:9:18,631
I'd take it. It's worth it if we become three again!

101
0:9:19,260 --> 0:9:20,182
Look, Vasík.

102
0:9:20,283 --> 0:9:25,693
If you put away your toothbrush by yourself and you ask for something reasonable, I'll give it to you, all right?

103
0:9:29,598 --> 0:9:30,435
Come on.

104
0:9:30,694 --> 0:9:31,333
All right.

105
0:9:31,497 --> 0:9:33,831
You'll take me to the mountains. These holidays.

106
0:9:34,191 --> 0:9:37,253
Couldn't you wish something better? What about seaside in summer?

107
0:9:37,418 --> 0:9:42,442
Why don't you ever want to go to the mountains? Because dad was a climber?

108
0:9:43,738 --> 0:9:46,067
Because the theater doesn't have a winter holiday.

109
0:9:46,167 --> 0:9:47,738
You'll make them, then.

110
0:9:47,838 --> 0:9:48,720
You will arrange it?

111
0:9:48,820 --> 0:9:49,491
Of course!

112
0:9:49,591 --> 0:9:50,619
And how, please?

113
0:9:50,719 --> 0:9:51,869
Look!

114
0:10:2,947 --> 0:10:5,189
You're my darling!

115
0:10:7,130 --> 0:10:8,668
Can you ski?

116
0:10:8,768 --> 0:10:12,904
I'm not allowed to ski. What if I broke a leg?

117
0:10:12,946 --> 0:10:16,043
Eat! We'll talk about it later.

118
0:10:16,299 --> 0:10:20,783
Don't be afraid, Mommy. I won't get killed like my dad.

119
0:10:22,893 --> 0:10:29,034
Everybody's going to the mountains! All the boys have dads, but I don't have even a dog!

120
0:10:32,242 --> 0:10:33,587
"My mommy."

121
0:10:33,737 --> 0:10:39,366
So, children. Before we start writing, we'll think about our mommies.

122
0:10:39,744 --> 0:10:42,898
What she's like, what she does, what she looks like...

123
0:10:42,998 --> 0:10:46,032
~ And what if both of them come?
~ Doesn't matter, there were six of them in our place.

124
0:10:46,132 --> 0:10:48,105
~ At one moment?!
~ No, one after another.

125
0:10:48,982 --> 0:10:58,733
Benda, Martinec. Put your exercise books on the table, you'll take an exercise paper and you'll rewrite the essay after the lessons.

126
0:10:59,072 --> 0:11:4,119
Please, comrade teacher, I can't do it today. I have to cook dinner.

127
0:11:4,188 --> 0:11:6,510
Vasek, don't clown around. Sit down!

128
0:11:7,061 --> 0:11:9,397
Talk, children, what is your mommy like?

129
0:11:10,575 --> 0:11:11,467
Nice.

130
0:11:11,914 --> 0:11:13,296
Nice eyes.

131
0:11:13,692 --> 0:11:14,958
Curly-haired.

132
0:11:15,485 --> 0:11:16,486
Truthful.

133
0:11:16,586 --> 0:11:17,444
Vasek!

134
0:11:17,544 --> 0:11:20,501
I'm already putting it down in writing!

135
0:11:26,612 --> 0:11:56,092
One, two, one, two,...and step...one, two,...one, two, three...one, two, three, four...

136
0:12:14,670 --> 0:12:20,054
Spartacus is the greatest man of antiquity and the role of Friga is a great chance for you.

137
0:12:20,672 --> 0:12:22,586
It's getting dark, they are both free.

138
0:12:24,259 --> 0:12:25,369
Get ready.

139
0:12:26,303 --> 0:12:28,022
And go.

140
0:12:29,559 --> 0:12:31,933
Everything is in the music, so listen to it.

141
0:12:36,328 --> 0:12:37,887
You are happy.

142
0:12:44,331 --> 0:12:46,180
This is useless...I can't work like this!

143
0:12:46,280 --> 0:12:47,787
I got up at 6 o'clock.

144
0:12:47,887 --> 0:12:49,767
How many opportunities do you think you are going to have?

145
0:12:49,867 --> 0:12:54,174
You're going to be retired before someone writes another ballet!

146
0:12:54,274 --> 0:12:55,457
Everybody can arrange it.

147
0:12:55,557 --> 0:12:57,450
~ Everybody else has a grandma.
~ What about your mother?

148
0:12:58,058 --> 0:13:1,787
You know her. She thinks that if she left for a few days,
the hospital would collapse.

149
0:13:3,888 --> 0:13:6,265
So you want to travel...?

150
0:13:7,878 --> 0:13:16,112
That week in February, when the school holidays are, I don't have performances, I thought that if you let me go, I'd...

151
0:13:16,213 --> 0:13:17,638
After what I told you?

152
0:13:18,911 --> 0:13:21,110
I'll make up for all the rehearsals.

153
0:13:21,210 --> 0:13:27,685
I'm nearly never at home. I can't stand the boy's complaints!

154
0:13:27,785 --> 0:13:30,625
That's out of the question. You're not going anywhere!

155
0:13:34,928 --> 0:14:22,154
¤ Radio plays a dramatic story about climbers on Mount Everest ¤

156
0:14:23,264 --> 0:14:28,954
Oh my God! Leave it alone, please. The steaks were supposed to be for Sunday.

157
0:14:42,161 --> 0:14:43,843
Go wash yourself.

158
0:14:44,604 --> 0:14:48,750
I wonder that you can listen to it...

159
0:15:9,518 --> 0:15:11,399
You bought beer?

160
0:15:33,513 --> 0:15:36,170
I'm asking you, why did you buy the beer?

161
0:15:36,270 --> 0:15:38,260
I thought he would come.

162
0:15:38,862 --> 0:15:39,590
Who?

163
0:15:40,694 --> 0:15:41,741
The Minister.

164
0:15:43,566 --> 0:15:47,085
Aniczka? You should go.

165
0:15:52,604 --> 0:15:56,113
You know what, Carla? Vasek can take the TV to his room.

166
0:15:57,921 --> 0:15:59,775
There's Chaplin at 19:30.

167
0:16:3,063 --> 0:16:7,465
I don't want Chaplin. I want you to be at home! Just like a proper mom...

168
0:16:27,089 --> 0:16:31,120
To make Vasek to be the main class cleaner is just like making a goat the head gardener.

169
0:16:31,220 --> 0:16:34,457
But this week he was amazing.

170
0:16:34,557 --> 0:16:44,715
He really cleaned up the classroom and in addition he was helping the school caretaker and sports teacher.

171
0:16:46,200 --> 0:16:50,140
I thought he'd done something wrong when you called me at the theater.

172
0:16:50,623 --> 0:16:54,057
We wrote an essay yesterday.

173
0:16:55,233 --> 0:17:0,062
Please, don't tell Vasek that I let you read it.

174
0:17:7,709 --> 0:17:14,253
He's a mug. "Mommy is going to get married." Such nonsense!

175
0:17:16,274 --> 0:17:18,728
Do you know what's the best about children?

176
0:17:19,294 --> 0:17:22,181
That they can see the world how it's supposed to be.

177
0:17:22,525 --> 0:17:28,535
And their world is mainly a harmonic home.

178
0:17:32,486 --> 0:17:36,100
And what would you do, if you were me, Mrs. Teacher?

179
0:17:38,273 --> 0:17:41,634
I would at least think about it, Mommy.

180
0:18:5,815 --> 0:18:7,695
You're going to let me go to the mountains.

181
0:18:9,086 --> 0:18:11,502
You'd have to resign from the theater.

182
0:18:11,792 --> 0:18:14,633
I can also break up with you.

183
0:18:23,773 --> 0:18:26,389
Mommy! Mommy's here.

184
0:18:26,807 --> 0:18:28,329
You usually don't even speak to me...

185
0:18:30,438 --> 0:18:32,891
Guess who came to have dinner with us?

186
0:18:35,894 --> 0:18:41,997
~ Girl, in a wig again. That will destroy your hair.
~ You scared me!

187
0:18:42,501 --> 0:18:47,569
If it didn't involve us, we could just laugh at the Vasek's ideas.

188
0:18:47,922 --> 0:18:50,957
It was really funny to make steaks for the school caretaker...

189
0:18:52,977 --> 0:18:54,880
Do you go anywhere on evenings at all?

190
0:18:55,549 --> 0:18:56,703
To theater.

191
0:18:57,776 --> 0:19:4,057
Why don't you call me? If I don't have a night shift, I'll be able to wait here with Vasek until 11.

192
0:19:4,450 --> 0:19:6,538
And in the evening you'll have to travel through the whole Prague.

193
0:19:7,888 --> 0:19:9,052
And what about Jindrich?

194
0:19:12,183 --> 0:19:17,198
If he had children, I wouldn't say a word. But in this situation...

195
0:19:18,851 --> 0:19:20,446
Do you think this is a life, Anna?

196
0:19:21,500 --> 0:19:23,161
He likes me.

197
0:19:23,596 --> 0:19:25,970
Then why doesn't he finally get divorced?

198
0:19:26,318 --> 0:19:28,350
Please, let it be.

199
0:19:29,867 --> 0:19:30,625
All right then.

200
0:19:31,696 --> 0:19:34,522
I'll talk to Jindrich myself.

201
0:19:36,477 --> 0:19:38,220
You've never meddled.

202
0:19:38,815 --> 0:19:40,672
I'm not going to humiliate myself.

203
0:19:40,969 --> 0:19:42,733
You behave just like life hasn't taught you enough.

204
0:19:45,550 --> 0:19:48,436
How long do you want to handle it by yourself?

205
0:19:49,770 --> 0:19:52,058
It's hard with you, Anna.

206
0:19:52,576 --> 0:19:59,624
When I told you in that situation a baby shouldn't be born, you didn't talk to me for a half year.

207
0:19:59,720 --> 0:20:1,845
You did it your way.

208
0:20:3,361 --> 0:20:6,302
You didn't know what you were facing.

209
0:20:6,916 --> 0:20:11,771
Talk to Jindrich. You'll save yourself only if you get married.

210
0:20:12,314 --> 0:20:16,463
You can always give me advice. But you can't help me and take Vasek to the mountains.

211
0:20:16,679 --> 0:20:21,234
I've already told you that mothers with children will get a holiday in that school holidays week.

212
0:20:21,986 --> 0:20:24,699
Then I have bad luck, since I don't work as a surgery nurse.

213
0:20:25,501 --> 0:20:29,703
I can save up a few days of holiday if I work 16-hour shifts.

214
0:20:30,608 --> 0:20:31,864
I'll take Vasek to my place.

215
0:20:32,697 --> 0:20:38,638
No, that wouldn't help. All the people in the house know me, somebody could tell Vasek something...

216
0:20:38,736 --> 0:20:40,544
Someday Vasek will know it anyway.

217
0:20:41,490 --> 0:20:43,667
How long are you going to hide it from him?

218
0:20:45,941 --> 0:20:50,921
Many children live just with a mother. Aren't there divorced marriages?

219
0:20:52,066 --> 0:20:56,390
But you -- are not divorced...

220
0:21:23,616 --> 0:21:28,009
Come in, little dog, come in. Don't be afraid. This is my mommy.

221
0:21:29,929 --> 0:21:31,512
Send that calf away immediately!

222
0:21:45,687 --> 0:21:48,468
Mommy! What about me??

223
0:22:14,217 --> 0:22:17,187
Mommy, why was uncle Jindrich at the train station with flowers?

224
0:22:17,675 --> 0:22:19,525
He came to tell me not to break a leg.

225
0:22:19,610 --> 0:22:20,804
You like him?

226
0:22:21,849 --> 0:22:22,786
A lot.

227
0:22:22,821 --> 0:22:24,464
But it's also going to cost a lot of money.

228
0:22:25,224 --> 0:22:26,800
I meant Jindrich.

229
0:22:28,004 --> 0:22:29,302
Why are you talking about that again?

230
0:22:29,977 --> 0:22:32,880
I don't like him. I'd know some better guys.

231
0:22:34,468 --> 0:22:39,975
Vasek, I'm warning you. I took you here with one condition -- that you'll stop finding me a groom.

232
0:22:40,075 --> 0:22:43,266
You can rely on me!

233
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:58,093
Daddy, Daddy, I can't find ski poles!

234
0:22:58,681 --> 0:23:1,400
Then buy a medicine against sclerosis.

235
0:23:7,815 --> 0:23:11,249
Thank you. Mrs. Bendová, you have telegram here.

236
0:23:12,949 --> 0:23:14,162
Here.

237
0:23:21,028 --> 0:23:25,807
I need to call Prague. Immediately. And a second call at 7 pm.

238
0:23:25,907 --> 0:23:27,292
All right.

239
0:23:37,329 --> 0:23:39,692
Vasek! You're not going to leave the terrace until I come back!

240
0:23:39,792 --> 0:23:41,016
Of course!

241
0:23:50,623 --> 0:23:51,434
Attention!

242
0:23:52,420 --> 0:23:53,439
I'm going!

243
0:23:54,098 --> 0:23:55,311
Out of the way!

244
0:23:58,268 --> 0:23:59,084
Attention!

245
0:23:59,974 --> 0:24:1,101
I'm going!

246
0:24:8,814 --> 0:24:17,526
Stupid boy! If I were your dad, I would beat your buttocks that you wouldn't be able to sit for a week!

247
0:24:18,044 --> 0:24:19,612
~ Are you OK?
~ Yes.

248
0:24:19,712 --> 0:24:22,061
~ What about your legs?
~ Tangled.

249
0:24:22,496 --> 0:24:26,821
Stand up then.

250
0:24:26,921 --> 0:24:29,040
~ Where are you from?
~ From the Snow White lodge!

251
0:24:29,140 --> 0:24:32,154
From the Snow White lodge? Hm. I'm really happy.

252
0:24:32,254 --> 0:24:38,010
With whom are you here? Why are you looking at me? With who are you here?

253
0:24:38,518 --> 0:24:40,223
With Mom, of course!

254
0:24:46,358 --> 0:24:50,967
Take your skis --- and go.

255
0:24:58,663 --> 0:25:1,241
Hello, sir, are you married?

256
0:25:3,400 --> 0:25:6,388
Vasek, Vasíczek, come quickly!

257
0:25:8,204 --> 0:25:11,339
This sweater really suits you, you're very nice in it.

258
0:25:11,439 --> 0:25:12,881
Why aren't you wearing pajamas?

259
0:25:12,968 --> 0:25:14,644
Am I supposed to go to the dinner in pajamas?

260
0:25:14,745 --> 0:25:17,079
No. We are going to have dinner here.

261
0:25:17,706 --> 0:25:22,214
Mom, Mommy, I want to go to a bar. At least for an ice cream.

262
0:25:22,345 --> 0:25:25,746
No, you have a lot of sins today and I've ordered a call.

263
0:25:29,374 --> 0:25:33,300
Mommy, I arranged something. He's going to wait there for me.

264
0:25:33,400 --> 0:25:33,792
Who?

265
0:25:33,892 --> 0:25:35,989
One of my friends.

266
0:25:37,158 --> 0:25:38,677
I'll return in a while.

267
0:25:39,181 --> 0:25:42,083
And you --- stay in the room, do you understand?

268
0:26:27,597 --> 0:26:28,518
Anna.

269
0:26:30,489 --> 0:26:36,679
Oh wow, you grew up! Even though you're still so petite.

270
0:26:37,736 --> 0:26:39,985
You don't remember me.

271
0:26:40,085 --> 0:26:41,939
~ I...
~ Don't you remember?

272
0:26:43,430 --> 0:26:44,862
~ I'm waiting here.
~ Ma'am, your call.

273
0:26:46,978 --> 0:26:48,287
I'm sorry.

274
0:26:53,248 --> 0:26:57,614
No, the telegram wasn't sent by Jindrich, but by the theater.

275
0:26:57,714 --> 0:27:0,865
Mommy... Please, come and stay at least those two days.

276
0:27:1,916 --> 0:27:5,519
I can't tell Vasek that we've just arrived and we have to go straight home again.

277
0:27:5,619 --> 0:27:7,680
I'm going to return on Thursday.

278
0:27:9,822 --> 0:27:11,790
It's not important who's sick.

279
0:27:11,891 --> 0:27:14,533
There's a change in the theater.

280
0:27:16,077 --> 0:27:19,158
We can't do anything then.

281
0:27:26,346 --> 0:27:29,943
~ How much is it?
~ One moment. I'll ask the post office.

282
0:27:33,777 --> 0:27:37,063
How many years since we haven't seen each other?

283
0:27:37,163 --> 0:27:42,178
You're here on holiday? As an instructor again?

284
0:27:42,278 --> 0:27:43,771
I've worked here for seven years.

285
0:27:43,871 --> 0:27:44,523
Here?

286
0:27:44,623 --> 0:27:46,472
Here I have a date with one boy.

287
0:27:46,572 --> 0:27:47,469
With a boy?

288
0:27:47,569 --> 0:27:54,094
I even don't know his name. I promised him to have an ice cream with him in the evening and now I've met you here!

289
0:27:54,194 --> 0:27:57,614
You're better and better. Instead of a drink, you invite boys for ice cream?

290
0:27:57,714 --> 0:28:1,615
But he's really small. You haven't seen such a boy yet.

291
0:28:1,715 --> 0:28:6,042
He told me his mommy loves dancing and if I wanted, he could take her with him.

292
0:28:6,434 --> 0:28:8,206
Please, why are you telling me?

293
0:28:8,306 --> 0:28:10,595
Well, you asked me what I was doing here.

294
0:28:11,712 --> 0:28:13,666
Maybe we'll meet again.

295
0:28:14,388 --> 0:28:15,369
Definitely.

296
0:28:16,038 --> 0:28:19,578
So don't delay yourself. Don't make him wait in the bar.

297
0:28:19,777 --> 0:28:21,866
He isn't waiting in the bar. He's there.

298
0:28:22,267 --> 0:28:23,989
Vasek! Come here!

299
0:28:24,089 --> 0:28:25,160
You have a primo boy.

300
0:28:25,260 --> 0:28:27,714
He's wild. What is this?

301
0:28:27,814 --> 0:28:28,986
That's a jacket.

302
0:28:30,162 --> 0:28:31,401
Say goodbye and go to bed.

303
0:28:31,501 --> 0:28:32,027
Goodbye.

304
0:28:32,127 --> 0:28:32,916
Bye.

305
0:28:38,752 --> 0:28:41,539
Prague. Who wanted to pay the call to Prague?

306
0:28:41,928 --> 0:28:43,297
I'll pay it.

307
0:28:45,584 --> 0:28:55,059
Mommy! Mommy! Open up! I didn't tell him anything! Really! Mommy! Open up!

308
0:28:58,484 --> 0:29:1,962
Vasek, you are going to worry me to death. What did you tell him?

309
0:29:1,997 --> 0:29:4,146
Only number of our room.

310
0:29:4,594 --> 0:29:5,695
And you invited him, didn't you?

311
0:29:5,795 --> 0:29:9,145
Yes, I wanted you to look at him.

312
0:29:9,245 --> 0:29:9,958
What?

313
0:29:10,058 --> 0:29:14,248
If we liked him, then we could be friends with him.

314
0:29:14,349 --> 0:29:16,021
That's all.

315
0:29:17,750 --> 0:29:20,901
Pack your stuff up. We're going home.

316
0:29:21,001 --> 0:29:22,644
Tomorrow.

317
0:29:39,588 --> 0:29:41,286
Mountain Rescue.

318
0:29:41,387 --> 0:29:45,645
No. He's on the hill.

319
0:29:48,695 --> 0:29:49,683
What are you doing here?

320
0:29:49,783 --> 0:29:51,492
I came for help.

321
0:29:51,592 --> 0:29:52,503
What happened?

322
0:29:52,603 --> 0:29:54,659
Mommy forbade me to talk about it.

323
0:29:54,992 --> 0:29:55,718
About what?

324
0:29:55,818 --> 0:29:57,591
That we're going home today.

325
0:29:57,831 --> 0:30:0,512
She promises we'll return, but we won't be back.

326
0:30:0,931 --> 0:30:2,709
I know her!

327
0:30:3,669 --> 0:30:7,060
You finally called. How is it on the hill?

328
0:30:7,160 --> 0:30:9,942
If mom knew that I'm under someone's supervision...

329
0:30:10,042 --> 0:30:11,428
Avalanche situation?

330
0:30:11,528 --> 0:30:15,255
I'll take care of myself, anyway. I'll sweep, I'll do laundry.

331
0:30:15,355 --> 0:30:20,757
When it's warmer, when it's warmer. Warn these locations immediately.

332
0:30:20,892 --> 0:30:25,460
Please, sir, let me stay here. I'm made for the mountains.

333
0:30:25,560 --> 0:30:28,971
So you're applying for service here? For how long?

334
0:30:29,071 --> 0:30:31,864
Two days. Until Mom comes back.

335
0:30:32,372 --> 0:30:33,309
Who's that boy?

336
0:30:34,046 --> 0:30:36,859
Well, he's such a Dopey from Snow White, isn't he?

337
0:30:36,959 --> 0:30:40,214
You make jokes and there's blocked snow plow in Labský Dùl.

338
0:30:40,314 --> 0:30:42,075
I've been having fun with that for a half hour now.

339
0:30:42,740 --> 0:30:46,181
Call Karel. I'll be there.

340
0:30:46,281 --> 0:30:47,550
And what about me?

341
0:30:47,650 --> 0:30:51,501
You know what? A real man never begs.

342
0:30:58,768 --> 0:31:1,502
If it helps you, you can leave the boy here.

343
0:31:1,723 --> 0:31:2,518
Vasek?

344
0:31:2,618 --> 0:31:7,572
You got more of them? It's hard for him. He's just come and he has to go back to the town.

345
0:31:7,672 --> 0:31:8,910
Well, he'll get over it.

346
0:31:9,109 --> 0:31:15,395
There are things, which no woman can understand. Simply --- I'll take care of Vasek for those two days.

347
0:31:15,495 --> 0:31:17,270
I don't understand why.

348
0:31:18,597 --> 0:31:23,048
We haven't had opportunity to talk yet. I'll have a guarantee that you're going to come back.

349
0:31:23,625 --> 0:31:25,453
You would be able to take care of a child??

350
0:31:25,553 --> 0:31:28,210
You can rely on me!

351
0:31:30,056 --> 0:31:32,458
I'm not so sure about that.

352
0:31:41,978 --> 0:31:50,497
Vasek, we'll go to Rokytnice for ski poles. And we'll take Mom to the train station.

353
0:31:51,345 --> 0:31:53,732
Vasek, are you really going to let me go by myself?

354
0:31:53,959 --> 0:31:55,960
You've already said I could. Don't worry.

355
0:31:57,063 --> 0:31:59,186
Lubos rescues people from avalanches!

356
0:31:59,286 --> 0:32:2,183
What do you mean --- Lubos? It's always Mr. Richman for you!

357
0:32:2,283 --> 0:32:6,080
Mommy doesn't know that we've been already friends for two hours.

358
0:32:6,180 --> 0:32:7,854
Vasek is coming with me!

359
0:32:7,954 --> 0:32:12,730
You have a great seat by the window. Don't worry, I've already cared for a whole climbing tea.

360
0:32:12,830 --> 0:32:14,407
I'll die from fear anyway.

361
0:32:14,815 --> 0:32:16,862
That would be a pity.

362
0:32:18,241 --> 0:32:21,460
Mommy is prima. She's already started calling you by first name.

363
0:32:24,169 --> 0:32:25,006
Bye.

364
0:32:49,816 --> 0:32:52,104
How did you figure out I'm a climber?

365
0:32:52,525 --> 0:32:56,151
I'm Detective Colombo. You have crampons in your cabin.

366
0:32:56,966 --> 0:32:58,078
You know what they are?

367
0:32:58,526 --> 0:32:59,765
~ Of course!
~ What?

368
0:33:0,023 --> 0:33:1,808
Metal boots for climbing.

369
0:33:2,934 --> 0:33:4,174
Look, where you are throwing the snow!

370
0:33:6,162 --> 0:33:9,021
And what is Chomolungma?

371
0:33:9,326 --> 0:33:13,711
Mount Everest. Hillary and Tenzing were the first people there.

372
0:33:17,819 --> 0:33:20,507
And which mountain over 8,000 meters high was first visited by people?

373
0:33:20,788 --> 0:33:21,741
Annapurna.

374
0:33:22,729 --> 0:33:25,101
And where were the most dead people?

375
0:33:25,201 --> 0:33:26,721
Nanga Parbat.

376
0:33:28,015 --> 0:33:29,750
And who was the first up there?

377
0:33:30,142 --> 0:33:33,721
Hermann Buhl. He's my second favorite. After my daddy.

378
0:33:34,926 --> 0:33:35,905
You're good.

379
0:33:36,005 --> 0:33:44,349
I have books. The Unbeaten Mountain. Tigers from Himalaya. That's on radio.

380
0:33:44,591 --> 0:33:47,015
~ Done?
~ Done!

381
0:33:47,251 --> 0:33:48,861
Go!

382
0:33:50,998 --> 0:33:52,935
And who buys those books for you?

383
0:33:53,208 --> 0:33:53,909
Daddy?

384
0:33:54,281 --> 0:33:56,506
Daddy was also a climber!

385
0:33:59,176 --> 0:34:0,339
And what does he do now?

386
0:34:0,439 --> 0:34:2,020
Now he's dead.

387
0:34:5,050 --> 0:34:7,058
Don't be upset with me, Vasek, I didn't know that.

388
0:34:7,475 --> 0:34:13,206
When they were walking in a line, he was the last one. And suddenly there was an avalanche.

389
0:34:13,954 --> 0:34:17,346
Wow! We rescued a snow plow!

390
0:34:21,023 --> 0:34:27,410
You'll take my sleeping bag. Once my only friend also borrowed it.

391
0:34:27,510 --> 0:34:32,155
He got intestinal flu. That's really bad, when it's -20° C.

392
0:34:32,255 --> 0:34:33,135
And where did you sleep?

393
0:34:33,235 --> 0:34:35,483
Well, we didn't sleep much.

394
0:34:35,583 --> 0:34:36,952
Do you have a lot of friends?

395
0:34:37,385 --> 0:34:43,049
No, I have a lot of acquaintances. Friends are boys who you can always rely on.

396
0:34:43,544 --> 0:34:47,207
Mom says that daddy had no friends.

397
0:34:47,307 --> 0:34:49,542
That's weird.

398
0:34:49,642 --> 0:34:55,382
When you hold the same rope with somebody, you must trust him. You cover his back and he covers yours.

399
0:34:55,482 --> 0:34:57,893
Then there's a real friendship.

400
0:34:57,993 --> 0:35:3,893
Maybe Mom thinks that somebody could have rescued him. Maybe the friend of his.

401
0:35:35,778 --> 0:35:43,109
I'd like to call Spindler¿v Mlýn, 93439. Thank you.

402
0:35:43,786 --> 0:35:45,579
You can cancel it.

403
0:35:46,168 --> 0:35:47,671
He called himself.

404
0:35:48,113 --> 0:35:49,018
Who?

405
0:35:49,473 --> 0:35:51,018
Spindler¿v Mlýn.

406
0:35:51,867 --> 0:35:55,541
He told me to write it down, in case I have sclerosis...

407
0:35:56,874 --> 0:36:2,589
Vasek ate seven dumplings, brushed his teeth, and now he's asleep like a log.

408
0:36:3,411 --> 0:36:6,531
He's an idiot. He's making fun of me.

409
0:36:6,861 --> 0:36:12,855
But he called an hour later, saying it's snowing outside, and that he can't fall asleep.

410
0:36:12,955 --> 0:36:15,557
Bozenka, I'm hungry!

411
0:36:16,514 --> 0:36:18,258
Today you were great, Anna.

412
0:36:21,405 --> 0:36:22,926
You made me really happy.

413
0:36:23,026 --> 0:36:25,171
That is probably because I took a nap in the afternoon.

414
0:36:25,499 --> 0:36:29,872
Took a nap? She was sleeping here for three hours as if she were dead.

415
0:36:33,308 --> 0:36:37,527
May I invite you for a dinner?

416
0:36:49,981 --> 0:36:51,855
Oh my God...

417
0:36:52,294 --> 0:36:55,824
I'll make seven pieces of him!

418
0:36:58,678 --> 0:37:1,010
Why did you try do make fire?

419
0:37:1,894 --> 0:37:3,929
I just wanted to make toast for you.

420
0:37:4,329 --> 0:37:7,494
It's already burning! You can rely on me.

421
0:37:7,766 --> 0:37:11,617
You can rely on me, too. Do I need my belt for you?

422
0:37:11,686 --> 0:37:15,166
Look. I borrowed these boots for you.

423
0:37:15,345 --> 0:37:18,374
Yours are good for dancing lessons, at best.

424
0:37:20,720 --> 0:37:24,662
Lubos, how does a man become a real climber?

425
0:37:24,762 --> 0:37:26,726
When he climbs his first hill.

426
0:37:26,826 --> 0:37:27,923
Which one?

427
0:37:28,495 --> 0:37:33,938
That's not important. When you like it, you're going to be climber for a whole life!

428
0:37:34,239 --> 0:37:39,942
You must have a will of iron and you have to know how to make decisions!

429
0:37:39,993 --> 0:37:41,031
Like what?

430
0:37:41,131 --> 0:37:47,322
Where to put your hands, your legs, how to keep warm.

431
0:37:47,723 --> 0:37:51,432
That's simple. You make a mistake and you're dead.

432
0:37:52,908 --> 0:37:55,715
I don't know... I'm sure my dad didn't make a mistake!

433
0:37:55,815 --> 0:38:3,843
I meant it another way.
A proper man is the most happy when he can overcome obstacles.

434
0:38:3,943 --> 0:38:8,342
My dad was proper! Strong! One head taller than you.

435
0:38:8,442 --> 0:38:13,597
Of course. The best man goes always the last in a line.

436
0:38:14,358 --> 0:38:15,825
You were never afraid?

437
0:38:15,925 --> 0:38:24,596
When you want to win, to beat a 8,000 m high mountain, which has been there for millions of years, you must have courage.

438
0:38:24,696 --> 0:38:25,662
So you weren't afraid.

439
0:38:25,762 --> 0:38:27,326
I was afraid.

440
0:38:27,776 --> 0:38:31,800
The wind in Himalayas sounds like an oncoming train!

441
0:38:32,131 --> 0:38:33,902
Once it made me cry.

442
0:38:34,002 --> 0:38:36,545
My dad was also in Himalayas.

443
0:38:36,645 --> 0:38:38,463
Why didn't you turn back?

444
0:38:38,563 --> 0:38:41,221
At night? We couldn't see.

445
0:38:41,321 --> 0:38:42,505
And in the morning?

446
0:38:42,605 --> 0:38:44,515
We started getting to the peak.

447
0:38:44,615 --> 0:38:46,048
You managed it?

448
0:38:47,092 --> 0:38:50,017
It was the happiest day in my life.

449
0:38:50,417 --> 0:38:56,763
The sun rose. There was silence. Only rocks and ice.

450
0:38:57,304 --> 0:39:0,111
You stand there and feel like God.

451
0:39:0,211 --> 0:39:3,832
I'm also going to be a little God! But Mom can't know that!

452
0:39:3,932 --> 0:39:6,717
A lot of people think that every climber is crazy.

453
0:39:6,907 --> 0:39:8,256
I'm crazy.

454
0:39:9,092 --> 0:39:12,486
I can see that. You're putting salt into your tea!

455
0:39:12,616 --> 0:39:16,087
Hold tight! Hold tight! Hold tight!

456
0:39:20,797 --> 0:39:24,876
One and two, one and two, one and two...

457
0:39:25,077 --> 0:39:34,882
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...

458
0:40:49,727 --> 0:40:51,752
I went to see a lawyer.

459
0:40:52,329 --> 0:40:54,857
You're buying or selling something?

460
0:40:54,904 --> 0:40:56,727
A divorce lawyer.

461
0:40:57,810 --> 0:41:3,647
What if the two of us tried it, according to the rules?

462
0:41:4,274 --> 0:41:7,816
I just don't know if I'll get used to Vasek.

463
0:41:35,224 --> 0:41:35,884
Do you know how to pull a whale's tooth?

464
0:41:36,374 --> 0:41:47,645
You get a sea crane, you give a wagonload of anesthetic to a whale, you prepare dynamite, 3, 2, 1, boom!

465
0:41:50,339 --> 0:41:52,163
What are you laughing at?

466
0:41:52,263 --> 0:41:55,316
I've never kissed a guy.

467
0:41:55,992 --> 0:41:59,369
How so? You didn't like your dad?

468
0:41:59,717 --> 0:42:2,505
I did! But I've never actually met him.

469
0:42:3,466 --> 0:42:8,797
~ Listen, friend, aren't you a little liar, by any chance?
~ A big one!

470
0:42:9,197 --> 0:42:13,163
Your dad was one head taller than me in the morning and now you don't even know him?

471
0:42:13,263 --> 0:42:15,960
In that time I was little like this.

472
0:42:17,772 --> 0:42:19,617
Mommy didn't get married again?

473
0:42:19,717 --> 0:42:25,500
No. I'd also like to have a daddy. Standa has already a third one.

474
0:42:26,121 --> 0:42:32,194
Mommy probably loved daddy a lot. When somebody loves somebody, he can't forget her.

475
0:42:32,294 --> 0:42:36,782
You'd be surprised how angry she is when I draw Annapurna.

476
0:42:38,388 --> 0:42:39,948
Your daddy was at Annapurna?

477
0:42:40,295 --> 0:42:42,837
Of course. His grave's there.

478
0:42:44,219 --> 0:42:45,693
I was also at Annapurna.

479
0:42:45,793 --> 0:42:47,531
With my daddy?

480
0:42:48,363 --> 0:42:50,333
No, of us, all returned home.

481
0:42:50,598 --> 0:42:55,193
My daddy was in the special expedition. They examined the soil under the icecap.

482
0:42:59,825 --> 0:43:1,247
Look, I'm a great dressmaker.

483
0:43:1,732 --> 0:43:8,713
Wait, wait, wait. You want to claim that your daddy was in expedition Annapurna with special geologic program?

484
0:43:8,813 --> 0:43:10,106
Of course.

485
0:43:10,206 --> 0:43:11,447
And when was it?

486
0:43:11,547 --> 0:43:13,440
When I was little like this.

487
0:43:13,541 --> 0:43:17,198
Vasek, Vasek, what are you playing at?

488
0:43:17,298 --> 0:43:20,483
You were little like this and you remember that your dad had shoulders like this?

489
0:43:20,762 --> 0:43:22,539
I have a photo at home.

490
0:43:22,889 --> 0:43:25,231
And you've never seen your dad?

491
0:43:25,331 --> 0:43:27,943
I'm telling you, that I was little like this.

492
0:43:28,044 --> 0:43:30,015
And what is it, little like this? What is it?

493
0:43:30,115 --> 0:43:32,505
When I was in my mommy's belly!

494
0:43:34,980 --> 0:43:35,664
You're 8 years old?

495
0:43:35,764 --> 0:43:36,540
Yes.

496
0:43:39,088 --> 0:43:42,338
And you were born in... September?

497
0:43:42,543 --> 0:43:44,582
Damn it, you're a psychic.

498
0:44:9,383 --> 0:44:11,124
What are you doing?

499
0:44:15,419 --> 0:44:17,526
I'm checking how much snow there's going to be tomorrow.

500
0:44:22,788 --> 0:44:25,581
You don't have to repeat every silly thing I do.

501
0:45:14,703 --> 0:45:19,326
Vasek, what would you say if I tried dating your mommy?

502
0:45:19,851 --> 0:45:21,757
You would try it?

503
0:45:22,839 --> 0:45:25,546
Would I try it... I will *do* it!

504
0:45:27,600 --> 0:45:28,996
You like my mom?

505
0:45:30,228 --> 0:45:33,549
~ I like YOU!
~ I like you, too!

506
0:45:44,041 --> 0:45:46,514
~ Lubos, you must be careful!
~ About what?

507
0:45:46,926 --> 0:45:53,300
That trying! Mom doesn't want to hear a word about marriage. She's nearly beaten me!

508
0:45:54,197 --> 0:45:56,127
I'll do what I can.

509
0:46:1,691 --> 0:46:4,217
~ Vasek!
~ Mommy!

510
0:46:33,162 --> 0:46:34,346
What are you doing?

511
0:46:34,730 --> 0:46:36,604
We arranged that, didn't we?

512
0:46:36,704 --> 0:46:39,875
Yes, but kissing was Lubos's idea!

513
0:47:39,069 --> 0:47:41,575
Stand up, lazy people! Stand up!

514
0:47:47,793 --> 0:47:51,852
~ One, two, one, two...
~ One, two, one, two...

515
0:48:3,548 --> 0:48:7,185
The boy skis great, what do you think?

516
0:48:15,358 --> 0:48:23,288
Knees bent...swivel those hips...go on...!

517
0:48:25,491 --> 0:48:29,293
Keep your knees together! Stop!

518
0:48:45,939 --> 0:48:49,805
Anna, when did we date each other?

519
0:48:50,515 --> 0:48:53,389
You know, I really can't remember...

520
0:48:54,006 --> 0:48:56,430
I think we could figure it out.

521
0:48:57,840 --> 0:49:0,493
You were at the conservatory.

522
0:49:0,990 --> 0:49:3,431
It's not important today, anyway.

523
0:49:4,805 --> 0:49:7,652
And wasn't it before I went to Annapurna?

524
0:49:11,663 --> 0:49:13,673
I really don't know.

525
0:49:13,774 --> 0:49:15,715
If you think...

526
0:49:15,815 --> 0:49:20,805
It only seems to me that Vasek wants to look like me.

527
0:49:21,865 --> 0:49:23,937
As if I were his daddy.

528
0:49:25,414 --> 0:49:28,115
Well, it probably only seems like that.

529
0:49:28,348 --> 0:49:29,393
Probably.

530
0:49:29,768 --> 0:49:34,528
Vasek wants to look like everybody. It was a school caretaker last time.

531
0:49:34,628 --> 0:49:39,142
But a school caretaker isn't a climber.

532
0:49:40,207 --> 0:49:42,301
Buried under an avalanche.

533
0:49:44,309 --> 0:49:46,719
To our last evening.

534
0:49:47,403 --> 0:49:49,136
Why did you take me here?

535
0:49:50,229 --> 0:49:53,837
I was thinking it's a really long time since you've been dancing.

536
0:49:57,169 --> 0:49:58,372
Everything is like old times.

537
0:49:58,472 --> 0:50:1,295
No. Nothing can be repeated.

538
0:50:6,839 --> 0:50:11,846
I'm leaving for the Alps in a month. Before that I'm going to be in Prague for a few days.

539
0:50:11,946 --> 0:50:14,511
Think about the "date" until that time.

540
0:50:16,046 --> 0:50:17,264
What date?

541
0:50:17,779 --> 0:50:22,458
You arranged me a funeral --- I'm going to arrange you a wedding.

542
0:50:22,558 --> 0:50:24,612
Wait, whom am I going to marry?

543
0:50:24,948 --> 0:50:26,860
Me, of course.

544
0:50:29,463 --> 0:50:31,063
You're getting divorced?

545
0:50:31,220 --> 0:50:31,220
I haven't ever gotten married.

546
0:50:33,075 --> 0:50:37,484
I haven't told you yet? I have such a miserable memory...

547
0:50:37,685 --> 0:50:39,486
I can't even remember the size of my shirt.

548
0:50:41,946 --> 0:50:45,005
Do you remember that we were here back then?

549
0:50:45,105 --> 0:50:48,897
Nine years ago, this was the only place with a music box.

550
0:50:52,864 --> 0:50:57,881
Do you remember about our bet that you would bring me flowers in 10 minutes?

551
0:50:58,370 --> 0:50:59,729
And I lost.

552
0:51:0,958 --> 0:51:4,797
No. Mountain rescue called about emergency situation.

553
0:51:5,032 --> 0:51:7,532
A man lost in Ob¿í D¿l.

554
0:51:7,973 --> 0:51:11,271
I'm glad that you remember the details.

555
0:51:11,619 --> 0:51:16,139
You rescued that man. You returned after midnight.

556
0:51:18,742 --> 0:51:21,744
Why didn't you get married?

557
0:51:22,102 --> 0:51:24,424
And why didn't *you* get married?

558
0:51:25,574 --> 0:51:28,583
I've always been more attracted by mountains.

559
0:51:30,262 --> 0:51:31,871
And what about now?

560
0:51:32,892 --> 0:51:35,685
Now I'm not strong enough for the hills.

561
0:51:36,777 --> 0:51:39,127
By that you mean you'd be strong enough for me.

562
0:51:39,342 --> 0:51:42,033
No. For our boy.

563
0:51:49,792 --> 0:51:51,558
You don't have to tell me anything.

564
0:51:52,123 --> 0:51:54,861
I won't reproach you. We'd known each other for fourteen days.

565
0:51:55,568 --> 0:51:56,393
Nine days.

566
0:51:56,910 --> 0:52:0,573
You were dating somebody. And I was in the way.

567
0:52:0,900 --> 0:52:2,679
And what have you been doing for that eight years?

568
0:52:2,779 --> 0:52:2,779
Whom did you want to marry anyway?

569
0:52:5,563 --> 0:52:7,179
Vasek is not your son.

570
0:52:7,672 --> 0:52:10,356
You are lying. We met here. In December.

571
0:52:10,456 --> 0:52:13,317
I went to Himalayas in January. And the boy was born in September.

572
0:52:13,590 --> 0:52:16,149
We returned from expedition in November. All of us.

573
0:52:16,403 --> 0:52:21,507
~ Nobody stayed on Annapurna under an avalanche.
~ I hope you won't be so stupid as to tell Vasek.

574
0:52:21,607 --> 0:52:26,504
If this is your decision --- you can rely on me.

575
0:52:30,893 --> 0:52:34,800
I was so happy with my friends that I didn't realize I was living alone.

576
0:52:36,073 --> 0:52:41,676
For example, this Christmas. There were a lot of people around me but no "my" person.

577
0:52:42,799 --> 0:52:46,024
And as I started thinking about it,
such a primo boy appears.

578
0:52:46,429 --> 0:52:48,165
And on top of that --- he's mine.

579
0:52:48,450 --> 0:52:51,908
Anna. Tell me. I'm begging you...

580
0:52:52,325 --> 0:52:54,222
Tell me he's mine.

581
0:52:54,645 --> 0:52:57,004
Please, don't be crazy.

582
0:53:0,381 --> 0:53:3,206
I hoped I wouldn't meet you ever again.

583
0:53:3,723 --> 0:53:9,924
If somebody is in my way today, I'll put him in the sack and I'll throw into the river!

584
0:53:12,621 --> 0:53:18,419
You can guess, you can count, but you don't have a single proof that Vasek is yours.

585
0:53:18,519 --> 0:53:19,357
I do.

586
0:53:22,268 --> 0:53:24,930
He's as amazing as me!

587
0:54:6,951 --> 0:54:8,156
Where were you running?

588
0:54:8,256 --> 0:54:10,407
To the train station. Lubos is coming today!

589
0:54:10,507 --> 0:54:11,232
Which Lubos?

590
0:54:11,332 --> 0:54:12,397
My daddy!

591
0:54:12,497 --> 0:54:13,517
A spare one.

592
0:54:14,293 --> 0:54:16,348
So Mom found somebody, after all?

593
0:54:16,448 --> 0:54:18,593
No. I found him by myself!

594
0:54:18,693 --> 0:54:20,546
He wrote nine letters to him!

595
0:54:21,823 --> 0:54:23,036
What is he like?

596
0:54:23,136 --> 0:54:26,769
A big one. A chief of a mountain rescue service.

597
0:54:29,428 --> 0:54:35,410
Mom has a first rehearsal today. We have to wait outside.

598
0:54:35,975 --> 0:54:37,317
Let's go inside then!

599
0:54:51,124 --> 0:54:52,513
This is Mom?

600
0:54:54,603 --> 0:54:57,164
Damn it, she's got steam!

601
0:55:24,299 --> 0:55:26,402
We're going to sleep in the same room.

602
0:55:30,702 --> 0:55:32,564
And who's the guy?

603
0:55:32,664 --> 0:55:35,048
Uncle Jindrich.

604
0:55:48,333 --> 0:55:53,471
I don't like him! He's not friendly and he doesn't like dogs.

605
0:55:58,207 --> 0:56:2,657
Then we'll put him in the sack and we'll throw him into the river.

606
0:56:6,219 --> 0:56:7,245
Enough!

607
0:56:7,721 --> 0:56:8,921
This is Annapurna.

608
0:56:9,226 --> 0:56:10,066
And up there?

609
0:56:10,427 --> 0:56:12,714
Also Annapurna. Also Annapurna.

610
0:56:13,321 --> 0:56:17,831
I screwed this one up. This was in December. This was when I was 5.

611
0:56:18,176 --> 0:56:20,765
And why is there a Christmas tree and those presents?

612
0:56:20,865 --> 0:56:24,764
For my daddy, of course. So that he's not alone on Christmas.

613
0:56:33,994 --> 0:56:35,699
~ I'll take you with me.
~ Really?

614
0:56:36,143 --> 0:56:37,369
When you are adult.

615
0:56:38,440 --> 0:56:40,813
~ Do you have that photo?
~ It's hidden away.

616
0:56:40,913 --> 0:56:43,661
Then show it to me.

617
0:56:51,526 --> 0:56:53,101
I don't want Mommy to steal it.

618
0:57:1,334 --> 0:57:2,956
Let me guess, will you?

619
0:57:8,215 --> 0:57:9,559
Am I right?

620
0:57:10,124 --> 0:57:12,197
You knew my daddy?

621
0:57:12,730 --> 0:57:13,902
Are you able to be silent?

622
0:57:14,002 --> 0:57:16,087
In front of your mom?

623
0:57:17,342 --> 0:57:19,424
This is me.

624
0:57:19,885 --> 0:57:22,981
It's not you! It's my dad!

625
0:57:23,474 --> 0:57:27,523
It's your dad, but it's also me!

626
0:57:27,623 --> 0:57:28,664
What does that mean?

627
0:57:28,764 --> 0:57:30,057
I don't know!

628
0:57:31,748 --> 0:57:33,248
That I'm your dad.

629
0:57:33,648 --> 0:57:35,578
That's not true!

630
0:57:35,678 --> 0:57:38,044
It's not you! It's my dad!

631
0:57:38,144 --> 0:57:39,752
Why couldn't it be me?

632
0:57:39,853 --> 0:57:42,494
My dad is dead! A hero!

633
0:57:42,594 --> 0:57:43,877
What are you doing here?

634
0:57:43,977 --> 0:57:45,312
Lubos is lying.

635
0:57:45,766 --> 0:57:50,336
Anna, please, don't be mad with me. I told him.

636
0:57:51,192 --> 0:57:55,527
You are egotistical. Idiot!

637
0:58:0,712 --> 0:58:2,241
Do you have a knife?

638
0:58:7,271 --> 0:58:10,372
I've been collecting these cars for five years.

639
0:58:13,187 --> 0:58:17,037
All of them are yours now.

640
0:58:27,840 --> 0:58:31,590
You mustn't take him seriously, Mom. He's a liar.

641
0:58:32,091 --> 0:58:35,616
And don't swear at him. He's going to have dinner with us.

642
0:58:37,837 --> 0:58:38,978
I'll help you.

643
0:58:39,078 --> 0:58:40,525
Me too.

644
0:58:52,423 --> 0:58:55,472
Mommy, how come Lubos knew my dad?

645
0:58:57,733 --> 0:58:58,473
I didn't know him.

646
0:58:58,573 --> 0:59:0,023
Why is he lying?

647
0:59:0,123 --> 0:59:4,728
You pointed at him. Were you his friend?

648
0:59:9,094 --> 0:59:10,831
I don't know.

649
0:59:11,294 --> 0:59:15,184
But I know! You left him under the avalanche!

650
0:59:15,322 --> 0:59:16,706
Damn it!

651
0:59:18,309 --> 0:59:20,214
Say something, Anna.

652
0:59:20,764 --> 0:59:23,078
Leave me alone. Both of you.

653
0:59:28,631 --> 0:59:30,169
I'll tell you something.

654
0:59:31,197 --> 0:59:36,672
If my dad were alive, he would be
at home with me every evening.

655
0:59:37,261 --> 0:59:39,633
He would go to the cinema with me.

656
0:59:39,733 --> 0:59:41,614
And we would have a dog.

657
0:59:41,714 --> 0:59:44,588
But your dad didn't know that you existed.

658
0:59:44,688 --> 0:59:46,014
If he knew, he would visit you.

659
0:59:46,153 --> 0:59:51,035
And why didn't he visit Mom? He knew she exists.

660
0:59:51,731 --> 0:59:54,331
Mom, is he my dad?

661
0:59:56,692 --> 1:0:0,871
~ Is he or not?
~ Give me a break.
~ I want to know!

662
1:0:2,296 --> 1:0:5,545
Yes, this is your dad.

663
1:0:13,661 --> 1:0:17,039
You screwed it up. Everything.

664
1:0:18,381 --> 1:0:22,134
Let Mom be! Go away!

665
1:0:37,425 --> 1:0:39,661
Mommy, don't cry.

666
1:0:40,318 --> 1:0:42,278
He's already gone.

667
1:0:43,084 --> 1:0:46,155
You've got me. I'm going to be with you.

668
1:0:46,255 --> 1:0:49,225
Until we die. Every day.

669
1:1:15,531 --> 1:1:18,389
Look, my dad is as accurate as a clock.

670
1:1:29,199 --> 1:1:31,199
Your mother called.

671
1:1:32,680 --> 1:1:34,880
She arranged a meeting with me.

672
1:1:35,617 --> 1:1:36,503
Tomorrow.

673
1:1:37,303 --> 1:1:39,133
Do you know what she could want to tell me?

674
1:1:39,233 --> 1:1:41,748
I can imagine what. To make you get divorced.

675
1:1:42,476 --> 1:1:43,981
And you don't want me to?

676
1:1:47,335 --> 1:1:50,300
I haven't been wishing anything else for four years.

677
1:1:54,075 --> 1:1:58,348
Maybe it would still be worth it. To talk about us.

678
1:2:1,800 --> 1:2:4,919
You should have gone to meet Vasek. Not me.

679
1:2:5,019 --> 1:2:7,109
I've been waiting in front of the school for an hour.

680
1:2:7,591 --> 1:2:8,792
So?

681
1:2:12,694 --> 1:2:14,150
Nothing.

682
1:2:14,631 --> 1:2:16,385
Why didn't you listen to me?

683
1:2:17,627 --> 1:2:20,166
I knew Vasek would never understand.

684
1:2:20,464 --> 1:2:23,769
Can I visit you?

685
1:2:24,067 --> 1:2:27,199
At 4? At 5?

686
1:2:28,376 --> 1:2:30,331
You aren't interested in who it was?

687
1:2:30,659 --> 1:2:31,869
I'll come in the evening.

688
1:2:33,118 --> 1:2:35,057
I don't even know you!

689
1:2:36,116 --> 1:2:37,408
You don't know anything about me either...

690
1:2:37,508 --> 1:2:39,443
And you made Vasek think we're going to live together.

691
1:2:39,735 --> 1:2:40,818
I'm afraid he doesn't want to talk to me.

692
1:2:41,221 --> 1:2:43,310
You could have written a word at least.

693
1:2:43,512 --> 1:2:46,243
I read about your return from Himalayas in the newspapers.

694
1:2:48,256 --> 1:2:50,121
Why didn't you write you were pregnant then?

695
1:2:50,410 --> 1:2:53,541
Where? To Asia? Camp number 4?

696
1:2:53,886 --> 1:2:55,095
I returned.

697
1:2:55,961 --> 1:2:58,445
The boy was nearly three months old.

698
1:2:58,545 --> 1:3:1,028
Why did you want Vasek never to know me?

699
1:3:3,196 --> 1:3:5,341
What did I do to you?

700
1:3:8,337 --> 1:3:15,412
I... I was kind of proud to be pregnant with you.

701
1:3:16,467 --> 1:3:20,853
I thought you were hero, when you rescued that man in Ob¿í D¿l.

702
1:3:22,056 --> 1:3:31,729
I thought... I thought you were going to be happy when you return and see us.

703
1:3:32,267 --> 1:3:34,549
That I'm as brave as you.

704
1:3:34,919 --> 1:3:37,832
That I kept the baby, against everyone.

705
1:3:42,596 --> 1:3:46,412
But if you'd written the boy was born...

706
1:3:47,270 --> 1:3:53,761
You didn't even remember me and you'd be so happy to have a baby?

707
1:3:56,083 --> 1:3:57,476
When are you leaving?

708
1:3:59,626 --> 1:4:1,450
In four days.

709
1:4:4,595 --> 1:4:8,840
Vasek needs time to get over it.

710
1:4:11,018 --> 1:4:14,727
If children could understand everything,
they wouldn't be children.

711
1:4:15,920 --> 1:4:22,756
Because there are more differences between children and adults than just size.

712
1:4:23,471 --> 1:4:25,264
It was also my fault.

713
1:4:25,688 --> 1:4:26,873
It wasn't.

714
1:4:29,097 --> 1:4:33,036
Vasík, did you want a dad? You did.

715
1:4:33,325 --> 1:4:37,306
You liked Lubos. You said he was a friend.

716
1:4:37,406 --> 1:4:43,087
He isn't, Mom. I cried for him while he was in the mountains with other boys.

717
1:4:43,187 --> 1:4:46,097
Lubos didn't know about you. You must trust me!

718
1:4:46,197 --> 1:4:48,589
He cheated me. He lied to me in the mountains already.

719
1:4:48,734 --> 1:4:53,208
He pretended to try dating you, and you were married a long time ago.

720
1:4:54,239 --> 1:4:55,736
No, we didn't.

721
1:4:57,264 --> 1:5:1,655
When I was young, I believed you when you said you bought me in a shop.

722
1:5:1,755 --> 1:5:5,289
But now I'm old enough to know how babies are born.

723
1:5:5,389 --> 1:5:6,398
Really?

724
1:5:6,751 --> 1:5:8,633
After marriage.

725
1:5:12,111 --> 1:5:17,563
Well... marriage isn't the main thing.

726
1:5:17,972 --> 1:5:19,385
It can happen when people love each other.

727
1:5:20,866 --> 1:5:27,031
If he loved you, Mom, he would visit us on Saturdays or when it's my birthday.

728
1:5:27,131 --> 1:5:29,973
You are stubborn just like your little tooth.

729
1:5:30,406 --> 1:5:33,150
We've been persuading it for two hours but it doesn't give in.

730
1:5:33,815 --> 1:5:37,807
But when it grows up, it won't hurt anymore, will it?

731
1:5:42,925 --> 1:5:45,003
Lubos will be waiting for you tomorrow in front of the school.

732
1:5:45,103 --> 1:5:47,474
I'm not going there anyway.

733
1:6:14,166 --> 1:6:18,265
Hello --- I told him.

734
1:6:18,911 --> 1:6:20,511
I did what I could.

735
1:6:21,823 --> 1:6:25,334
It depends on you.

736
1:6:26,345 --> 1:6:27,697
I'm going to gargle.

737
1:6:31,451 --> 1:6:35,877
Vasík, you are a goon. Such beautiful pictures... Why did you destroy them?

738
1:6:36,014 --> 1:6:38,370
I'll never be a climber anymore.

739
1:7:23,337 --> 1:7:29,054
You've got a primo bike. You're good at it.

740
1:7:30,060 --> 1:7:38,018
I've bought new climbing equipment, ropes, crampons.
I have it in my hotel. Do you want to have a look?

741
1:7:38,338 --> 1:7:40,579
I've brought you something.

742
1:7:51,466 --> 1:7:52,437
Do you like him?

743
1:7:52,537 --> 1:7:53,983
I'm not allowed to bring home strange dogs.

744
1:7:54,083 --> 1:7:57,982
He's not a strange dog. He's Ben. Keep him. He's yours.

745
1:7:58,447 --> 1:8:0,988
And what about Mom? Won't she beat me?

746
1:8:1,088 --> 1:8:3,426
Don't worry. She'll be happy.

747
1:8:3,739 --> 1:8:6,548
You're lying! And you're teaching Mom to lie.

748
1:8:8,495 --> 1:8:11,063
You plot against me over the phone.

749
1:8:29,261 --> 1:8:36,850
I let you go to the mountains so I wouldn't lose you and you forget me in one day there.

750
1:8:37,187 --> 1:8:39,357
It's quite funny, actually.

751
1:8:44,064 --> 1:8:48,618
When a man is afraid, he's about to lose.

752
1:9:29,850 --> 1:9:32,071
You really want to go to a hospital?

753
1:9:32,171 --> 1:9:36,376
No. Your mother invited me to your place.

754
1:9:37,810 --> 1:9:40,510
I would have to know that, wouldn't I?

755
1:9:40,610 --> 1:9:42,179
You won't invite me upstairs?

756
1:9:46,367 --> 1:9:49,336
You shouldn't have gone with me at all.

757
1:10:0,375 --> 1:10:4,770
Anna, would you mind Vasek having a dog?

758
1:10:7,523 --> 1:10:9,213
No way.

759
1:10:9,550 --> 1:10:14,152
That's a disaster... Don't worry! I'll fix it!

760
1:10:16,499 --> 1:10:19,490
Leave me alone. Both of you!

761
1:10:29,894 --> 1:10:30,687
Where is he?

762
1:10:30,944 --> 1:10:32,729
Who? Vasek or that dog?

763
1:10:33,331 --> 1:10:35,269
Jindrich, of course!

764
1:10:42,953 --> 1:10:48,109
You've gone crazy. All of you.

765
1:10:55,706 --> 1:10:58,104
Mommy, are you glad that we have Beník?

766
1:10:58,416 --> 1:10:59,930
Of course.

767
1:11:0,587 --> 1:11:2,700
Go to wash. Don't play.

768
1:11:2,749 --> 1:11:5,447
Come, Beník, we'll make a beautiful dog out of you.

769
1:11:6,207 --> 1:11:10,058
Lubos has a dad in Kamenice. They have rabbits.

770
1:11:10,428 --> 1:11:15,469
Also a cat. A pig. You would have a grandpa.

771
1:11:16,579 --> 1:11:18,763
You always wanted a grandpa, didn't you?

772
1:11:20,538 --> 1:11:23,977
Enough. Everybody can screw up something nice.

773
1:11:24,315 --> 1:11:28,123
Either me or Lubos. But you're a primo boy.

774
1:11:28,223 --> 1:11:31,681
And it was quite good idea with those toothbrushes!

775
1:11:32,617 --> 1:11:38,100
~ There should be three people in every family.
~ We are three: you, me, and the dog.

776
1:11:41,503 --> 1:11:45,105
The last dress rehearsal! Three minutes! Soloists on stage!

777
1:11:47,407 --> 1:11:51,409
Let's go for it, folks! Make it fun!

778
1:11:52,511 --> 1:11:56,413
Spartacus will be stabbed, and Fergie raises the sword!

779
1:12:3,737 --> 1:12:4,609
What's up?

780
1:12:4,831 --> 1:12:6,809
Today I've been waiting for two hours.

781
1:12:8,250 --> 1:12:13,773
~ I can't force Vasek to talk to you.
~ Soloists -- Spartacus, Fergie, on the stage, please!

782
1:12:15,402 --> 1:12:19,443
He didn't even show up. He's trickier than an 8000m mountain.

783
1:12:20,420 --> 1:12:22,388
Anna, I can't take it anymore.

784
1:12:23,164 --> 1:12:26,135
Vasek was waiting for you for eight years and you can't take it for a few days?

785
1:12:26,235 --> 1:12:28,964
~ But I'm leaving tomorrow!
~ Fergie, Fergie! On stage!

786
1:12:29,761 --> 1:12:32,356
What if you let the mountains be.

787
1:12:32,456 --> 1:12:34,697
I can't leave the whole expedition in trouble.

788
1:12:35,035 --> 1:12:37,391
You always rush in just like an avalanche.

789
1:12:37,491 --> 1:12:39,829
You made me a grave, Anna! I wouldn't do that...

790
1:12:40,504 --> 1:12:44,332
I wouldn't be able to read in the newspaper that somebody is alive and make him a funeral.

791
1:12:44,432 --> 1:12:47,659
And what was I supposed to tell Vasek when he started asking about his dad?

792
1:12:47,916 --> 1:12:51,948
You waited for me one more year, before he started to talk?

793
1:12:52,627 --> 1:12:55,869
Three more years before he started to think.

794
1:12:57,672 --> 1:13:0,105
If there was an idiot in this world, it was me.

795
1:13:0,206 --> 1:13:2,878
You don't need to apologize. I don't care about you today.

796
1:13:2,978 --> 1:13:8,151
Don't say that... There's our 8-year-old boy to be stubborn.

797
1:13:8,696 --> 1:13:10,856
Aniczka, you must go!

798
1:13:25,385 --> 1:13:27,470
A moment, a moment. Visitors' day is Wednesday!

799
1:13:27,570 --> 1:13:28,803
My wife's here.

800
1:13:33,069 --> 1:13:34,349
Vasek's got lost.

801
1:13:34,615 --> 1:13:35,499
What are you on about now?

802
1:13:35,599 --> 1:13:39,022
When I rang and told him about your broken leg, he just went crazy.

803
1:13:39,437 --> 1:13:41,890
Before I packed your stuff up, he was gone.

804
1:13:41,990 --> 1:13:43,812
I've been looking for him for an hour.

805
1:13:43,912 --> 1:13:46,564
Please, don't panic, now he's already at home.

806
1:13:46,717 --> 1:13:48,349
He's been already here?

807
1:13:50,063 --> 1:13:53,680
There are many hospitals in Prague and he found the right one.

808
1:13:54,882 --> 1:13:57,215
We have a clever child, don't we?

809
1:13:58,258 --> 1:14:0,104
Why is she staring at us?

810
1:14:0,204 --> 1:14:2,093
She's my mother.

811
1:14:3,165 --> 1:14:9,289
Look after his homework and put the keys into the mailbox before you leave.

812
1:14:11,049 --> 1:14:12,345
Go.

813
1:14:18,506 --> 1:14:24,319
What a behavior! So you have a child together?! Then explain to me...

814
1:14:27,018 --> 1:14:28,962
He was that rascal??

815
1:14:29,706 --> 1:14:33,556
If they don't make peace, I will die...

816
1:14:35,558 --> 1:14:42,562
¤ Radio tells a poetic story about the Himalayas... ¤

817
1:14:52,960 --> 1:14:55,289
Why didn't you tell me about having grandma in the hospital?

818
1:14:56,463 --> 1:14:59,528
Can't you imagine how worried I was about you?

819
1:15:40,990 --> 1:15:42,735
I'll spend the night here.

820
1:15:43,160 --> 1:15:45,800
You don't have to go to Valentas'.

821
1:16:19,901 --> 1:16:21,711
I couldn't come today.

822
1:16:22,049 --> 1:16:23,331
Why not?

823
1:16:23,431 --> 1:16:24,677
I had detention.

824
1:16:24,777 --> 1:16:26,919
A bummer, isn't it?

825
1:16:27,019 --> 1:16:29,529
Mom has to go to school.

826
1:16:29,629 --> 1:16:30,510
And why?

827
1:16:31,128 --> 1:16:32,897
I didn't want to write an essay.

828
1:16:33,330 --> 1:16:37,212
You know what? I'll go to school instead of Mommy.

829
1:16:37,526 --> 1:16:39,565
But you are leaving tomorrow.

830
1:16:39,822 --> 1:16:40,977
I'll stay here with you.

831
1:16:41,077 --> 1:16:41,675
You'll go.

832
1:16:41,775 --> 1:16:48,195
I'll arrange it with Mom. Girls don't know anything about friendship.

833
1:16:48,460 --> 1:16:49,721
And you do?

834
1:16:49,821 --> 1:16:51,111
I do.

835
1:16:52,712 --> 1:16:54,601
I've already written that essay.

836
1:16:56,099 --> 1:16:57,234
"What does my dad do?

837
1:16:57,746 --> 1:17:3,990
"My dad is a chief of mountain rescue. He does what he says. He waits for me in front of the school at 3 o'clock."

838
1:17:4,441 --> 1:17:7,548
"He's reliable. He bought me a dog."

839
1:17:7,916 --> 1:17:12,928
"He's got experience because he's a climber. He climbed a 8000 m high mountain."

840
1:17:13,193 --> 1:17:15,912
"He gets over all obstacles."

841
1:17:16,012 --> 1:17:18,934
"He's a good friend."

842
1:17:28,300 --> 1:17:30,193
Do you know how to pull out a tooth of a kangaroo?

843
1:17:30,715 --> 1:17:34,925
You make a sea crane, you prepare dynamite...

844
1:17:35,190 --> 1:17:37,426
It wasn't a kangaroo, it was a whale!

845
1:17:37,527 --> 1:17:38,452
That's not important.

846
1:17:38,552 --> 1:17:43,212
It is! Because you have to give dynamite to a whale. A kangaroo would visit a dentist.

847
1:17:43,557 --> 1:17:46,719
3, 2, 1!
