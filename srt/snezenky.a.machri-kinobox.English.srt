18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,997  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
Some beginning, eh?

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,277  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,556  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:510

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,798  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,959  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
and when he sees a hobo, he starts
raging like a shrew.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,874  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
and when he sees a hobo, he starts
raging like a shrew.

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,473  X1:325 X2:394 Y1:484 Y2:510

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,671  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
Charles is sick!

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,071  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:516

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,798  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,591  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'll get a pill, Charles,

The snowmobile driver is as drunk as
a newt.

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,593  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,158  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:510

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,437  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
the snowmobile cannot take our

82
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,518  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
Can't the bus go any higher?
- This requires fitness.

83

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,991  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
Which one of you'll make my bed?

94
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,231  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
And what do I get for it?

95
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,354  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, what would you think...

96
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,873  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:510

97
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,675  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,279  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
We'll all be sent home.
This is asking for trouble.

99
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,112  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come off it!

109
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, gentlemen, this looks like
a decent set up.

110
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,398  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
Attention!
Order of the day number two.

111
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,593  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:483 Y2:516
Ptáèek on duty.

112
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,553  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:510
Here.
...Nìmcová.

113
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,638  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:510
Here!
- Schedule for tomorrow:

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,198  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
- 6.30 a.m. reveille, 6.45
a.m. to 7 a.m. morning work-out,

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,078  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:510
- 7.30 a.m. breakfast...

116
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,598  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:516
And Bob's your uncle!
...9 a.m. line-up for morning activities.

117
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,159  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
12 to 1 p.m. lunch,

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,951  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
...9.30 p.m. body hygiene and 10 p.m.
Lights out.

119
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,949  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:510
Everybody sit down.
- This will be as much fun as a funeral...

120
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,389  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:510
Are there any questions?
Well?

121
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,830  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
Please, sir, can we synchronize our
watches to your time?

122
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, and when will we be able to go out
shopping, sir?

123
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,032  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:516
Can I make a telephone call to Prague?

124
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,238  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
And do we get any time off here?

125
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,958  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:510
Yes and when will we be able to build
that snowman?

126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,675  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:484 Y2:510
Silence!

127
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,950  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
I said be quiet!
We're not getting anywhere.

128
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,076  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
Elect a representative from among you
who'll pass on to me

129
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,390  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
your individual requests.

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,836  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky!
I'm for Vicky!

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,638  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:510
Who's in favour?
- Sure.

132
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,633  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky! Vicky!
- Vicky's number one!

133
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,793  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
Any other suggestions?

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,156  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
With your permission, sir,

135
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,512  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:510
I d like to point out that all were
in favour.

136
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,712  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
Cabadaj, I'm surely not going
to discuss it with you!

137
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,037  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's a pity.
Then Radek in my place.

138
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,996  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:510
All right.
So let it be Radek.

139
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,869  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:510
And now Betty wants to say a few words.
- Yes.

140
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,435  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'd like to say a few words.

141
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,956  X1:103 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
Will you please pay attention for a few
moments, concerning our lodgings.

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,515  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:515
So... well, what is it, Radek?

143
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,071  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'd like to submit the first request.

144
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,231  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:510
When will we be able to build that
snowman?

145
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,832  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
Some set-up, isn't it?

146
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,550  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:515
You can build the snowman between five
and six in the afternoon,

147
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,756  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:510
during your time off.
Is that sufficient?

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,633  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:448 Y2:510
Thank you.
It is sufficient.

149
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,595  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:510
Well...

150
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,237  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have a heavy breath
and my head is aching,

151
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,239  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm fat as a sack
and my legs are hardly bearing me.

152
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,878  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:516
And so I'm leaving

153
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,559  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:510
and in fact I don't know where to.

154
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,790  X1:156 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
But I don't mean to say by this
that I flee from here.

155
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,151  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:515
Gee, what a member you have, Vicky!
Not bad, is it?

156
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,593  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
Sure enough, mate...

157
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,751  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:510
Watch out, Karda.
Come in!

158
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,758  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
Excuse me.

159
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,349  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:515
Oh, excuse me, excuse me, Miss,

160
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,756  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm terribly sorry.
We thought it was Mr Karda.

161
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,478  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:510
You're not in bed?

162
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,955  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
There's a terrible smell here.
What's smelling so awful?

163
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,758  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, it's probably onions.

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,831  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:510
Onions are good for you, onions contain
a lot of...

165
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,478  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:516
You've been drinking, haven't you?

166
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,593  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:484 Y2:515
No, Miss.

167
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,318  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:510
How could you have thought of a thing
like this?

168
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,833  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:516
Just you wait till...
- Why us?

169
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,399  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:510
...Mr Karda sees this.

170
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,473  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:516
But, Miss, men have a sense of smell
seven times less developed than women.

171
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,958  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, yes, maybe, but we used to use
perfume in such cases.

172
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,679  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, but then you might think that we
had girls here.

173
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,673  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you reading?

174
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,836  X1:158 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:510
Francois de la Rochefoucald -
A Cruel Book

175
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,354  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
with Light-Hearted Reflections
on the Hardship of Life.

176
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,352  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:510
Whose is this?
- Mine.

177
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,638  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know it.
- Borrow it if you like.

178
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,430  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
Thanks.
So go to sleep now.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,788  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't overdo it with those vitamins.
Good night.

180
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,756  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:516
Those who will not admit that they may
be wrong are those

181
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,315  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
who are most often wrong.

182
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,435  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:448 Y2:516
What?
- Nothing.

183
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,398  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
Radek underlined this.

184
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,438  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:510
And Karda wants to treat them like
little children.

185
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,716  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hm.
I can't really blame him.

186
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,869  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm always very happy to be back home
with nobody missing and no additions.

187
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,239  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
That's the way things are.

188
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,595  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
Once after a ski course I had to take
a student for a pregnancy test.

189
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,118  X1:328 X2:390 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hm.
Still.

190
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,353  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'd trust them more.

191
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,079  X1:318 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:511
Quiet.

192
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,829  X1:112 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:516
My little ducklings, open the door for
your Mother Goose...

193
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,158  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go have that coffee.

194
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,838  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
But hurry up and quiet!
Close it shut!

195
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,309  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
Gosh, Charlie, what's that you're
wearing?

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,037  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's the fuss?
Haven t you ever seen

197
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,396  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
a man wearing pyjamas?
- A man yes, but not Charlie.

198
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,629  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:448 Y2:516
Psst!
Be quiet!

199
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,269  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:516
I've inherited it from my Granddad.
It would be a waste to throw it away.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,639  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've got my Granny's nightshirt.

201
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,438  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've got frozen feet for a change.

202
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,670  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:516
Agreed.
It's freezing here.

203
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,239  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you reading?

204
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,038  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
You can borrow my socks.
They're in the cupboard.

205
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,838  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:510
Thanks. Up here?
- Yeah.

206
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,196  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:510
Charlie boy, come sit by us.
C'mon.

207
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,596  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, thank you,
may I?

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,389  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I thought we were going to have
a party under blankets.

209
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,239  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:484 Y2:510
Aaaaa...

210
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,996  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:510
I think I can hear somebody walking
about.

211
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,958  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll go have a look.

212
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,874  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:510
I never thought I'd have to be
a maintenance man...

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,275  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:516
Put it down.
...here tonight.

214
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,955  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come, I'll warm you up, Vicky.

215
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,269  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hm. In I go.
Mind the feet.

216
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,513  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:516
In bed with the girls again.

217
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,074  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
But look, you could at least take off
your shoes, you pig!

218
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,630  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
Okay.
What about you two?

219
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,513  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:510
You'll catch a cold!

220
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,990  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hey, boys, you can get into my bed.

221
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,870  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:510
This is just fine,
but who'll make the coffee now?

222
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,109  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:510
That I don't know.
- Neither do I.

223
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,954  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
It seems to me that the ladies
are having visitors.

224
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,116  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Karda here.
Open the door, will you?

225
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,672  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
I insist that you open the door!

226
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,194  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is it, sir.
We are asleep.

227
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,236  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:510
I won't have this.

228
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,598  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where are they?

229
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,759  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
I wouldn't smile in your place.
I know everything.

230
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,558  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:510
What does he want?

231
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,871  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
Marika, where are they?

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,592  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
But who, Daddy?

233
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,757  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:510
You know very well what I'm asking,
Marika.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,036  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:510
I don't know.

235
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,279  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:510
Ouch!

236
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,118  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:448 Y2:510
Careful.
Watch out!

237
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,118  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
What's going on here?

238
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,710  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it, mate?
- What!

239
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,954  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:510
Oh, excuse me, sir...
- At last.

240
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,358  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, boys, stop horsing around,

241
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,592  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
I know that you ve been
in the girls' room.

242
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,636  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:516
I don't know about anything, sir.

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,754  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:515
You don't, do you?
Gee, that tickles!

244
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,558  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:515
Of course, ice-cold.

245
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,718  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:510
But that's because the heat's not on.

246
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,075  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:510
That's because you're letting too much
fresh air in.

247
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,952  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
Boys, I'm warning you.

248
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,598  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:510
I won't tolerate such behaviour.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,718  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
Looks like this trip's all fouled up.

250
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,719  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't cross your bridges before you've
come to them.

251
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,389  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
Yupee! Hop! Hop! Hey!

252
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,473  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
Gosh, what a long line!
I thought it was a workday.

253
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,278  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:510
It's vacation time in the G.D.R.

254
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,271  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
Gentlemen,
I don't like jumping the queue,

255
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,793  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:516
but in this case we can't help it.

256
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,678  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's go.
- It's not fair, but necessary.

257
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:516
Watch out, watch out, d'you hear me?

258
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,354  X1:116 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
Be careful, these are new skis, don't
step on them.

259
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,794  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:510
This winter leaves a lot to be desired.

260
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,391  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
Folks, will you please line up and
everybody will be happy.

261
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,473  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:510
Marika, come here!
Here we are.

262
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,079  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
Look!

263
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,958  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is crazy.

264
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,679  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:516
Going downhill is executed from
the basic downhill posture,

265
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,830  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:516
which means the knees are slightly bent,
the body is inclined forward

266
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,558  X1:098 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:510
and its weight is shifted onto the lower
ski.

267
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,838  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
How does it go, Miss?
- Very well, thank you.

268
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,318  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:510
May I dust the snow off your back?
- Thanks.

269
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,958  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
It might lower your authority.

270
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,719  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
Could we come along on the lift
with you?

271
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,189  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
My girls're doing quite well.
- Help!

272
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,279  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:510
Sure.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,958  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:510
Where d'you think you're going...
Get back in line...

274
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,959  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look, wise guy,
get back or I'll put you back.

275
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,629  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:510
We're the national ski team.
- Just a moment.

276
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,274  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:510
National ski team, my eye!
Get back in line.

277
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,430  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:510
Did you hear me?
Get back in line!

278
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,349  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why us again?
Everybody back in line!

279
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,156  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
But we're going to stand here for ever.
I'm sure you'll survive.

280
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,715  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, they're jumping the queue too.

281
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,311  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get back!
Don't jump the queue.

282
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,436  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:516
Did you hear me?
- We're training for the Olympics, Jack!

283
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,999  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
Olympics, my eye!

284
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,755  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're the one to teach me about skiing,
you upstart.

285
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,478  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
Please make way here.

286
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,158  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why don't you maintain order here?

287
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,198  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's your business, not mine.

288
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,789  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't you understand Czech?
Was? Ich verstehe nicht.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,639  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
Aaaa... You...
Don't jump the queue, damn!

290
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,439  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
But he was holding a place for me.
- To the end of the queue with you!

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,110  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
Go bugger your own students.
- Don't be fresh, young man!

292
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,398  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's going on?
- They're jumping the queue.

293
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,272  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:516
Are we here to stand in line or to ski?
- Theoretically the latter, friend.

294
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,032  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
And we're supposed to educate them.

295
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,231  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:510
How the hell long are we supposed
to stand here.

296
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,952  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm giving up.

297
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,510  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
Snowdrops, girls, follow me,
we're going up on foot.

298
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,393  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whaaat?
- We're walking.

299
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,638  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
Everyone's using the lift only we can't.
- Didn't you hear what I said?

300
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,115  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's unfair, Miss.
- Come on, girls.

301
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,397  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:515
Take off your skis and come on.
- It makes me mad, too.

302
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,551  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:510
We can reconcile ourselves to what
others do unto us.

303
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,720  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:516
It is in what we do unto ourselves that
the difficulty lies.

304
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,829  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
Excuse me.

305
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,070  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:516
You underlined that in Rochefoucauld,
didn't you?

306
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,517  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:515
We haven't advance too much,
have we, sir?

307
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,995  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
Nobody's keeping you from going up
on foot.

308
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,277  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
In these boots?
- The boots are not the problem.

309
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,673  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go!

310
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,235  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:448 Y2:515
Radek!
- Gee, look!

311
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,719  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:516
Vicky's going up.

312
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,191  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
What's going on?
- C'mon! C'mon!

313
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,315  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yeah.

314
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,590  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
I thought you also disagreed
with jumping the queue.

315
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,276  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, I do disagree,
but then people hold you for a sucker.

316
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,555  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:448 Y2:510
Are you angry?
- No.

317
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,554  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:484 Y2:510
Arrivederci!

318
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,713  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
And Bob's your uncle!

319
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,479  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
For this evening I've prepared
an amusing game for you.

320
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,194  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
Here on these pieces of paper,
everybody quiet please,

321
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,039  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
here on these pieces of paper,

322
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,873  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:510
are written the names of famous pairs
of lovers.

323
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,039  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
For instances Romeo and Juliet,
Tatyana and Onegin...

324
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,238  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:483 Y2:510
Michalíková and Vanìk!

325
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,879  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
What are they in?
- Why, they're in 2B Form.

326
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,951  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
And the pair must seek each other out
with the aid of some quotation.

327
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,394  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:510
Meet you by the john at break time,
Michalíková!

328
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,630  X1:096 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:516
But you mustn't use the name of one of
the pair.

329
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,551  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
You must use a quotation.

330
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,596  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:516
For example:
I cast my brimmer far away.

331
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,875  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
Or something like that.
- What does he cast away?

332
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,719  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:516
Cyrano, you nitwit.
- And what happens when I find my lover?

333
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,394  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
Then you'll dance together.
- That's stupid...

334
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,789  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:516
And what happens if I don't know any
quotation?

335
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,592  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:510
Can I be Don Juan?

336
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,959  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, I really don't know...

337
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,071  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
I think that's a very nice game.

338
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,948  X1:076 X2:645 Y1:448 Y2:516
And when you don't know something your
literature teacher here'll advise you.

339
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,238  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come and get your pieces of paper.

340
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,637  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come on Sir, let's play.

341
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,191  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who doesn't have their piece of paper.

342
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,719  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come on, boys.

343
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,838  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:510
The wolf and the little Red Riding Hood,
that's beautiful...

344
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,117  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
Little Red Riding Hood!
- Desdemona!

345
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,833  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:510
Desdemo... Oh no!

346
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,480  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:483 Y2:516
Hynek, Vilém, Jarmila...

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,039  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
How come that I, Manon,
have all that good luck?

348
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,509  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:447 Y2:510
Sultán!
Sultán!

349
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,992  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well now, where are you,
you bastard of a dog?

350
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,431  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Bow-wow, that's me, your Tyrl.
- What, you?

351
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,317  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:516
I refuse to dance with you, you creep!
- Why?

352
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,238  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:510
Sir, take a piece of paper too.
- What?

353
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,833  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:516
All right...

354
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,393  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:516
Punch and Judy.

355
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,198  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
And they have killed our Ferdinand.

356
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,356  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
How come that I, Manon,
have all that good luck?

357
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,715  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:515
And feet in warmth, Miss Müller.

358
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,550  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
So they killed our Ferdinand.
- I'm *vejk, Miss.

359
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,313  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
For the better to see you,
little Red Riding Hood.

360
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,270  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'm writing to you, what can I say,
what can I further add.

361
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,675  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
You wrote to me, do not deny.

362
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,636  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:510
I read Your trustful lines.

363
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,596  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:516
That love expression, pure and sweet...

364
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,437  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:516
Oh, Ophelia, oh hell, she's supposed to
be a young girl.

365
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,670  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:483 Y2:516
Hynek, Vilém...

366
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,989  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:516
Judy...

367
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,834  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
Jarmila...
- My god, what a stupid game!

368
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,432  X1:062 X2:658 Y1:484 Y2:516
How come that everybody likes me, Manon?

369
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,513  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:484 Y2:516
Judy!

370
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,038  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
Has anybody seen Judy?

371
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,959  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:484 Y2:516
Judy!

372
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,673  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:484 Y2:516
Judy!

373
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,197  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here.
- Oh sorry, I forgot.

374
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,510  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's all right.
Have you lost Punch?

375
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,757  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
We're short of hands, Judy!

376
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,116  X1:058 X2:662 Y1:448 Y2:516
Would you be good enough to show me your
piece of paper?

377
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,630  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why?

378
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,075  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
I see... Since when do wolves try to
pass off as Onegin?

379
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,399  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:510
Since now.

380
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,152  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:510
I see you've been watching Arabella
on TV.

381
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,714  X1:315 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:516
May I?

382
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,109  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sorry, Radek, we have to follow
the rules of the game.

383
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,713  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
What an idiotic game.
Sorry!

384
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,199  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:516
Lights out!

385
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,436  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:510
How about a game?
- I'm broke.

386
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,592  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
We can play for matchsticks.

387
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,871  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
What a sorry state of affairs!

388
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,199  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, we could also play for
who's going to clean up the room.

389
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,352  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who'd bother with cleaning?

390
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,836  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's play for something worthwhile.

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,675  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, for instance, like for
who's going to offer Karda a drink.

392
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,836  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:510
No.
I've a better idea.

393
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,277  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's play for Marika.

394
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,472  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
You've a filthy mind, Vicky.

395
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,553  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:484 Y2:510
So what?

396
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,473  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wouldn't it be great to make it
with Karda's daughter?

397
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,678  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's wrong with the idea?
That we're all running after her

398
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,359  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:510
is clear.

399
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
But if we step on each other's toes,
none of us will get anywhere.

400
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,755  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yeah,
but that's a thing you can't play for.

401
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,034  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:510
If we can't then we can't.

402
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,674  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
But in that case that nincompoop
of an instructor'll get her.

403
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,352  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:516
Okay, I'm game.

404
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,311  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:484 Y2:510
Fine.

405
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,118  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:510
The lowest deals.

406
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,431  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
Looks like they're playing cards.

407
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,397  X1:107 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:516
I've always said the boys in our class
are absolutely impossible.

408
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,875  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is crazy.
- Absolutely impossible.

409
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,314  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:510
But the B Form is a different cup
of tea.

410
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,433  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
Another one.

411
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,359  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:516
Enough.

412
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,999  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:510
No ace.

413
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,112  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
Girls, di you know that Vicky wears
one pair of socks a whole months,

414
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,356  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
then he throws them away
and buys a new pair.

415
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,433  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:510
Who put them there?
Charles.

416
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,192  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you want to know I think Charles is
quite nice.

417
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,437  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
C'mon, he's always got a silly
expression...

418
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,593  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Girls, go to sleep.

419
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,756  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
Marika, did you hear what I said?
Sleep!

420
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,594  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:510
Marika isn't here.
- And where's she?

421
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,078  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, we thought she was with you...

422
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,196  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes of course.
That's all right.

423
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,791  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:510
Now go to sleep.
- Yes!

424
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,709  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:447 Y2:516
Tell me, Vladimír,
where is it you live in Prague?

425
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,869  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:447 Y2:510
At Pankrác.
- I live in Krè.

426
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,155  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
That's fine, it's quite near.

427
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,433  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you doing here?

428
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,113  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
I went to get a drink.

429
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,959  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you wearing?

430
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,637  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:448 Y2:510
A sweater.
- So I see.

431
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,553  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
Whose sweater?

432
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,272  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:447 Y2:510
Vladimír's.
- How come Vladimír's?

433
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,391  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:510
I was cold so he lent it to me.

434
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,159  X1:323 X2:396 Y1:484 Y2:510
I see.

435
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,518  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well the next time you're cold,
come and borrow my sweater!

436
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,713  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes, sir.

437
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,638  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
And its after lights out!

438
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,150  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
Okay, I'm going.
- I thought we had agreed

439
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,630  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
that you'd follow the rules
just like everybody else.

440
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,433  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yeah.

441
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,832  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
And what about you?

442
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,998  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:516
Me... I was also thirsty and...

443
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,074  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:516
I see.
- Well, good night.

444
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,999  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:516
Night...

445
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,269  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:516
Another one.
Enough.

446
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,119  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:510
No ace.

447
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,753  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:516
So I've won, gentlemen.

448
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,159  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's been my pleasure.

449
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,433  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
Mr. Hrouda!

450
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,039  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
Mr. Hrouda!

451
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,433  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hello!

452
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,835  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hello!
- What is it?

453
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,072  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're not heating the rooms enough.

454
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,750  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
What do'you mean?
- There's not enough heat.

455
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,512  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:510
We're out of coal.

456
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,356  X1:116 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you trying to tell me, man?

457
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,550  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:510
There's a big pile of coal in front of
the house.

458
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,512  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:514
I said we're out of coal.
There s no coal in the boiler room.

459
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,119  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:510
And is it such a big problem to get it
down here?

460
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,757  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
What d'you mean down here.

461
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,512  X1:138 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who's going to get it down here?

462
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,192  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, who.
You!

463
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,152  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
But I'm a stoker, not a porter.

464
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,479  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:516
Stoker you say?

465
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,952  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:516
So you'll let us freeze, right?

466
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,749  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:516
Sir, you're an educated person.

467
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,152  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:510
You must know very well that coal
doesn't have little feet.

468
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,319  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:516
Some beginning.

469
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,471  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:516
Yes, is that you?

470
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,952  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:447 Y2:516
Vladimír, there's a telephone call
for you.

471
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,234  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:448 Y2:516
For me?
- For you.

472
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,958  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
And who's calling?

473
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,710  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know.
It's a long distance call.

474
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,437  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hello... hello.
This is Titch.

475
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,309  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who's calling?
Titch speaking.

476
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,628  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is Prague.
One moment, please.

477
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,950  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'll put you through right away.
Hold the line...

478
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,150  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
May we join you?
- Why not.

479
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,150  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:483 Y2:516
We'll put Vladimír a bit to the side...

480
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,592  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll be gone for a while anyway.

481
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,957  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:516
Some broad from Prague's calling him.

482
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,759  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you speaking, *pindl?

483
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,876  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
One moment... please,
I'll make the connection immediately.

484
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,592  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:515
Hold on, hold on...

485
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,955  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:515
Mr Tits?
Not Tits, Titch...

486
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,590  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, Mr Tits.
Mr Tits, please hold onto the receiver.

487
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,558  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:515
One moment, I'll make the connection.
- Yes, hold on, Tits, hold on.

488
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,232  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't seem to hear... hello!
Hello!

489
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,558  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who is it you're calling?

490
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,552  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
Will you have some tea?
Yes.

491
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,433  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:516
Thank you.

492
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,113  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:448 Y2:514
Careful.
It s a bit hot.

493
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,432  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is Prague, an urgent call.
I'll put you through.

494
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,199  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
One moment, please.

495
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,473  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:510
Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.

496
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,075  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hello, where's the call...
Hello... Hello...

497
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,834  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
Quiet!
Will everybody please listen to me.

498
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,756  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:516
As far as your grievances about heating
are concerned, we have a problem here.

499
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,319  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:510
What is it?

500
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,550  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:510
Karda said you're to sit with
the teachers.

501
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,549  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whose lousy idea's that?
- I'll wait till you've done, Vladimír.

502
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,359  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:516
The pile of coal which is in the yard

503
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,715  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:510
needs to be taken down to the boiler
room.

504
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,593  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
What d'you say boys?

505
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,876  X1:085 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:510
But what do they have a paid stoker here
for?

506
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,560  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well he can't he's got a bad back.

507
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,156  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:510
Yeah, I know.
- No comments.

508
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,675  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:510
You're moaning like an old woman for
a few shovelfuls of coal.

509
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,956  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:510
Shovelfuls of coal are not the issue.

510
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,233  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
I just don't understand why we should
do the work someone else is paid for.

511
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,550  X1:122 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
And anyway, it was not in the order
of the day.

512
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,713  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
Just what d'you mean?

513
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,279  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:510
Leave them alone.

514
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,513  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
Betty and I will do it if it s such
a big problem for them.

515
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,956  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:515
Hm.
- Listen, shouldn't we...

516
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,359  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
They're playing upon our emotions.
This is a question of principle.

517
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,071  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
Today we'll shovel some coal and

518
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,756  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:510
tomorrow we can cook our own breakfast
because the cooks'd like to lie in.

519
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,515  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
Aren't they cavaliers?
I think they d let us freeze to death.

520
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,557  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who was it called you from Prague?

521
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,358  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
You'll be surprised - Radek.

522
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,317  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:448 Y2:510
Radek?
Oh I see.

523
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,953  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
That creep of an instructor has no idea
that I won her in the card game.

524
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,753  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is crazy.

525
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,036  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:510
What the hell!
- Just look at them.

526
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,839  X1:106 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:510
I think he's capable of chatting her up
on that lift.

527
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,758  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:510
If you like I can ditch the boys this
afternoon

528
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,512  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:484 Y2:516
and we can go and have some ice-cream.

529
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,750  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:510
An ice-cream sundae?
Sure.

530
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,038  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now watch hour I'm going to get that
creep down.

531
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,959  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:510
Just watch.

532
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,712  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:483 Y2:516
Vladimír, mind the ski pole!

533
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,512  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's going on?
That was elegant!

534
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,150  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:515
Watch out!
- Marika, watch out!

535
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,235  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your ski!
- My ski!

536
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,389  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:483 Y2:516
Vladimír, my ski's gone!

537
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,436  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gosh, what were you doing?
- Catch it!

538
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,876  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky, go!
Sure thing.

539
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,033  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:483 Y2:515
Vladimír, ouch!

540
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,471  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:447 Y2:516
Vladimír, come and have a look!
- I've done something to my leg.

541
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,355  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come here!
- What's wrong with it?

542
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,159  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:510
Ouch...!

543
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,832  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:510
Try to stand up.
Come on!

544
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,876  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
Ouch!
That hurts terribly.

545
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,955  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:510
Where?

546
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,473  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't know.
I can't bend it.

547
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,879  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:515
Here?
- Yes, there.

548
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,956  X1:114 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:510
It's a good think you've not lost your
boot too.

549
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,158  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't see how you can think this is
funny.

550
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,072  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't worry, we'll find, it.

551
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,952  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
Yes, but in three pieces.

552
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,756  X1:119 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well at least you can screw off your
binding.

553
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,230  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yeah. But
what if I m not able to get new ones?

554
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,871  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:510
This was an original Austrian ski
for five hundred.

555
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,755  X1:089 X2:632 Y1:448 Y2:516
I was making milk deliveries all summer
to earn the money.

556
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,710  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
I hope you're not going to cry for such
a silly reason.

557
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,189  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
At least we're alone, aren't we?
- I really like that.

558
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,753  X1:129 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
I lose skis costing a hell of a lot of
money

559
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,796  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
and all you're interested in is us
being here alone.

560
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,792  X1:116 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't get excited, Marika, I know the
ski's over there.

561
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,873  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
Oh yes, there it is.

562
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,558  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:510
And it's whole!

563
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,757  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
There you see.
I told you it'd turn out all right.

564
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,437  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, what do I get in return?
What do I get?

565
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,116  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:510
Whatcher doing?
Leave me alone.

566
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,549  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:515
Wait, Marika, wait.

567
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,837  X1:150 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:510
But, Marika... Marika... Marika...
- Leave me alone!

568
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,235  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who d'you think you are, you creep!

569
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,236  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:484 Y2:516
Every good deed must be justly punished.

570
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,553  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
Leave that sledge alone.

571
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,119  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:484 Y2:516
You should've been downstairs long ago!

572
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,633  X1:071 X2:648 Y1:484 Y2:516
Am I supposed to break my back, or what?

573
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,711  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:516
Those boys'll really never learn.

574
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,713  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
Just look, Betty.

575
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,389  X1:083 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'm sure they've been shopping and have
a rucksackful of beer

576
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,193  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:516
and now they're
trying to get in through the back door.

577
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,273  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:516
As if this hadn't happened at least
twenty times during my teaching career.

578
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,676  X1:096 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:516
But these are in a class by themselves.

579
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,636  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:510
The three of your, here!
- What is it?

580
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,475  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:510
Don't ask me what it is and come here.

581
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,792  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
What shall I do with them Betty?

582
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,075  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it you have behind you?
- A rucksak.

583
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,469  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:516
And what d'you have in the rucksack?

584
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,430  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:448 Y2:510
Nothing.
- I see.

585
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,394  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:510
And why does this nothing clink like
a bottle?

586
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,513  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
Sir, that's probably because I've milk
in there.

587
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,638  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look, boys, I can take a lot,
but you needn't make an idiot of me.

588
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,836  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
But we're not making a... sir... of you.
- But really, sir.

589
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,709  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
An idiot... we'd never dare to make
an idiot of you.

590
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,473  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well then, let's see.

591
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,275  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'd really like to have a drink of that
milk of yours.

592
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,878  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm thirsty after lunch...
- Well, as you like, sir.

593
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,438  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:510
Down the hatch!

594
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,317  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
Okay, girls, okay... Okay... Okay...

595
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,472  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:510
I liked that stunt with the milk, boys!
- Come here!

596
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,073  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:510
Let's make a deal.

597
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,358  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:510
You have trouble laying, your hands
on booze

598
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,273  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
and I have trouble with that
pile of coal under the snow there.

599
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,952  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:448 Y2:510
Why not.
Well?

600
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,073  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:510
It's a deal.

601
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,953  X1:146 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hey, wait a minute.
I thought I heard somebody talk

602
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,712  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
about principles this morning.

603
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,755  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
But a bar in the boiler room that's not
a bad principle, is it?

604
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,311  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:515
Excuse me, sir.

605
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,391  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
Could you test my physics like you
promised?

606
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,150  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hm.
Oh yes.

607
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,751  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, tell me... sit down...
- Thank you.

608
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,149  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:484 Y2:516
Tell me something about Newton's laws.

609
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,951  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes.
Force is a basic physical quantity.

610
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,950  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:484 Y2:516
And, yes...

611
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,036  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
When Newton slept under a tree...

612
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,079  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come on!

613
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,756  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:510
And what's the definition of the first
law?

614
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,079  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:510
The first law?

615
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,955  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gosh, is that the law of action
and reaction?

616
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,197  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:510
Er... that is when one body acts on
another

617
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,468  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
and then as this body acts,
like the first...

618
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,950  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
...well, that's the action and this
again provokes,

619
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,509  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
in return-like and then it acts...
- Well, d'you know what?

620
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,115  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:510
Come again when you really know
the stuff.

621
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,190  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
The legs are in the basic downhill
posture, the knees slightly bent,

622
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,113  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:510
the body inclined forward and weight is
shifted onto the lower ski.

623
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,998  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:483 Y2:515
Vladimír, what is it?

624
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,829  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'll follow you in a moment.
- Just leave him with us.

625
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,834  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:510
We also want to learn, don't we?
- Of course we do.

626
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,993  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm going on.

627
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,551  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gee, look, Marika fell!
Marika fell!

628
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,958  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
As if it'd never happened to you!

629
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,951  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you all right?

630
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,873  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yes.

631
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,038  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hey, would you like to come and have
some ice-cream with me?

632
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,072  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who, me?
- Yes, you.

633
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,833  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
Sure...

634
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,472  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:510
D'you see what I see?
- Yeah.

635
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,593  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, I'll be...

636
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,358  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:483 Y2:516
All right, Vladimír.

637
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,238  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:483 Y2:516
Where's your team, Vladimír?

638
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,395  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:516
Practising the long radius turn.

639
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,950  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
Just make sure it's not too long,
will you?

640
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,238  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:516
Follow me, girls!

641
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,432  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sir, if you're looking for the boys,
they went down there.

642
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,630  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
You know I normally take a pill,
but it always makes me sleepy.

643
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,394  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:510
You didn't take any sugar.
- Aha.

644
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,198  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:510
As I was saying it was only this time
I didn't take one

645
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,799  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
because I wanted to have a good time
and you saw what happened.

646
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,275  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:510
I really felt terribly sorry for you in
the bus.

647
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,990  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:515
I often feel terrible, Marika.

648
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,352  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:516
It seems to me someone here has a very
short memory.

649
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,949  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:484 Y2:510
So what?

650
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,712  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
In that case you shouldn't have played
last night.

651
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,478  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
What?
- Nothing, nothing.

652
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,275  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
Will you have a sundae?
- Just a minute.

653
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,833  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's my turn.

654
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,831  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:516
Two cups of tea and four glasses of rum.
Quiet water runs deep.

655
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,436  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:516
Or are you trying to tell me you're
helping me here?

656
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,272  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

657
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,273  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:447 Y2:516
It's only that Mr Mácha here thinks
that winning's the same thing as losing.

658
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,232  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
Nothing really, it's only that the
gentleman here thinks

659
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,709  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
that when he draws a trumph card,
he's got it made.

660
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,798  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
The three of you again and Kardov*...
of course.

661
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,713  X1:315 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:516
May I?

662
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,999  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:516
Certainly.

663
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,948  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well.
- Here's your order, gentlemen...

664
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,633  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:515
There must be some mistake,

665
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,358  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:448 Y2:515
this isn't ours.
Ts, ts, ts...

666
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,636  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
So it's one to one.
Is that clear?

667
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,631  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come on!
- But, Daddy, I...

668
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,358  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:510
I said come on!

669
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,476  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hurry up!
- I have to get my anorak, don't I?

670
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,799  X1:091 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:510
As far as I'm concerned, you're a son of
a bitch.

671
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,311  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:510
But Vicky, I couldn't help it.
She herself...

672
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,358  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:516
...try to understand,
she really wants me,

673
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,959  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:510
you're not going to ruin everything
for me.

674
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,995  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's forget about it.

675
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,036  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is something you can't play cards
for anyway.

676
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,392  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, thank you very much.

677
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,716  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:510
How could you dare to do a thing like
that.

678
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,068  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'm listening.
- It's no use.

679
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,629  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's no use?
- To talk about it with you.

680
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,199  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
What d'you mean?

681
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,310  X1:115 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:516
Because you don't intend to discuss
anything with anybody anyway.

682
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,357  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
Like with Vicky.
- Well, okay.

683
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,558  X1:142 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:516
But I do intend to discuss things
with you.

684
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,679  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
D'you understand the situation
you've got me into, Marika?

685
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,718  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:510
But, Daddy, what about my situation?
- What?

686
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,157  X1:144 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
D'you know what it is to be your
daughter?

687
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,839  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Nobody here likes you,
they all make fun of you.

688
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,674  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
When I go into my room all the girls
stop talking.

689
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,638  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here, Marika.
To be popular is very simple.

690
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,636  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
All you want to do is to be on equal
footing with me, but we're not equals,

691
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,474  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
because I'm responsible for you,
while you're not responsible for me.

692
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,750  X1:093 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:516
But what makes you so sure that you're
right all the time.

693
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,399  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:516
Thirty years of practices experience.

694
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,436  X1:169 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
But what makes you so sure
of yourselves?

695
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,994  X1:078 X2:642 Y1:447 Y2:516
I reprimand Cabadaj, Pfievrátil and Mácha
for their arbitrary absence from

696
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,755  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
the training area and the consumation
of alcoholic beverages.

697
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,594  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:510
This means suspended expulsion till
the end of the course.

698
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,793  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:484 Y2:510
Well.

699
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,395  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:516
I have to go on a trip tomorrow.

700
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,996  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:516
Any transgressions reported to me by
the teacher on duty

701
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,390  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
will be strictly punished.

702
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,278  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:510
Set the table for dinner.

703
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,478  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky, what happened there?
- Nothing worth mentioning...

704
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,473  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:447 Y2:510
Vladimír!
- Yes?

705
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,276  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm not satisfied with you either.

706
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,678  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
What happened today, that was in fact
neglect of mandatory supervision.

707
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,592  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, I...
- Come off it...

708
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,677  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
And would you please save all your
affections towards girl students

709
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,754  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:516
for a later date.
- But perhaps...

710
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,359  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:515
I know, I know, I know.

711
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,756  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:483 Y2:515
But I mean it, Vladimír.

712
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,750  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
And don't forget I must write
a characteristic of you.

713
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,790  X1:084 X2:637 Y1:448 Y2:516
And sweat them out on the trip tomorrow
so they blow off some steam.

714
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,834  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:447 Y2:510
Vladimír, I didn't want you to get into
trouble because of me.

715
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,436  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's okay.
Not to worry.

716
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,673  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:516
And you know, going to that tea-room was
my idea too.

717
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,078  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
You were showing off in front of
the Snowdrops as if I didn't exist.

718
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,833  X1:275 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:510
But I didn't...

719
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,752  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:510
And I also wanted that sundae.

720
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,875  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:510
It's no use getting under his skin.
- I know.

721
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,753  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:516
Sulking?

722
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,513  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:516
Not really.

723
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,955  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's only that upstairs they're
preparing some idiotic programme

724
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,513  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
like last night.

725
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,833  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
You know what's interesting?

726
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,948  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:510
What at sixteen seems to a person
idiotic

727
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,710  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:510
can later apperar to be quite nice.
And vice versa.

728
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,954  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:510
In how many years?
- What?

729
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,271  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, in how many years does this
turn-around come about?

730
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,199  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:516
Have a guess.

731
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,797  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, you're... twenty-six?

732
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,276  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:448 Y2:516
Careful.
You must always guess less for a woman.

733
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,638  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:510
Under all circumstances.

734
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,633  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:516
Okay, eighteen?

735
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,279  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:516
Twenty-four.

736
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,115  X1:120 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
But for that matter, it wasn't so long
ago that boys would climb

737
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,270  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:510
into my window to see me.
- Yeah?

738
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,239  X1:109 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:516
But from an educational point of view
I'm strictly against it, of course.

739
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,554  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
So it's not all roses for you, either.
- Why?

740
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,518  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
You have to keep pretending...

741
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,152  X1:116 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
You mean to say you don't pretend?

742
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,356  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'd always like to be my own person.

743
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,714  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:516
Really?

744
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,950  X1:080 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:516
Then how came you're standing here just
like Vicky?

745
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,756  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:510
Our trail today will take us from
the Pine Chalet

746
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,515  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:515
through the Devil's Valley to
the Mountain Goat Chalet,

747
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,274  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:515
from there along the green markers
to the Crossroads Chalet,

748
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,715  X1:106 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:510
from there up to the Shepard's Chalet
and down the downhill course

749
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,438  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:484 Y2:516
and back home along the green markers.

750
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,193  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:510
"I'm glad you said,, will" because that "
makes it sort of conditional.

751
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,753  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yes?

752
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,117  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:516
Is this the Big Brains' idea?
- No. I planned the trail.

753
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,830  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
So I think we should learn it by rote
in case the Big Brains wants to test us

754
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,876  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:510
and we can go have a drink somewhere,
can't we?

755
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,349  X1:109 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:510
Vicky, I'm not at all interested in your
ideas.

756
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,036  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I also think that by the evening
you'll know the trail pretty well.

757
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,512  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:515
So first team, follow me!

758
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,195  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
Along the green marker?
- Along the green!

759
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,598  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:510
Stick to the track!

760
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,959  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
Stick to the track!
- Shit!

761
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,351  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:510
The track... track...

762
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,997  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
I just don't understand.
Why do such pricks always get

763
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,513  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:516
the best girls?

764
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,555  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:510
Refreshments... refreshments...

765
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,071  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
You had me thinking for a while
you were not one of us.

766
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,631  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
If anybody wants to use the bathroom,
then do so quickly...

767
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,752  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:510
...We're carrying on along the green
markers.

768
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,796  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
You don't mean it, do you?
- Vladimír...

769
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,632  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
We're taking a short-cut.

770
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,231  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:510
It's a longer route,
but the trail's much worse.

771
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,277  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's crazy.
- Vladimír, please

772
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,952  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:516
can we have at least a cup of tea?

773
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,276  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're soft.
That's what he's waiting for.

774
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,391  X1:113 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hell, he wants to wear us out in front
of Marika.

775
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,637  X1:108 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, gentlemen, we'll have to get our
own back later.

776
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,199  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go.

777
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,433  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:510
At the double.

778
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,358  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hey, Vicky, look...

779
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,558  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's just the two of us here,
it's no good.

780
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,153  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm not game.

781
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,108  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:510
Ouch!

782
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,278  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let me see, Marika.
- Leave me alone.

783
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,158  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
Just what d'you think you're doing?

784
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,952  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
Does it hurt, Marika?
- It's all right.

785
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,749  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wise guys, aren't you?
Let's get going.

786
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,469  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
We can't go down this hill!
- Yes, you can.

787
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,311  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
With cross-country skis we'll all break
our damn legs.

788
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,590  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:510
You've got to be kidding.
- We're not out of our minds.

789
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,398  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'd like to point out to you that you've
been conditionally

790
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,959  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
expeled from the course.

791
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,270  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is crazy,
I m not going to break my neck.

792
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,516  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
You need downhill skis for this.
- How about tobogganing it?

793
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,989  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
But I've got a bad knee!
- So let's go!

794
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,593  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's crazy.
- His type is worse than the Big Brains.

795
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,359  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
All chummy...

796
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,196  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let's go,
Marika come on!

797
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,515  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
Marika...
- Don't be silly, boys, c'mon!

798
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,189  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
This really is a tricky place,
but you did very well.

799
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,474  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's the matter, Charlie,
did anything happen to you?

800
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,879  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't be silly.
- Are you all right?

801
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,036  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know.
- Does anything hurt?

802
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,958  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:516
I can't...
I simply can't...

803
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,349  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
Charlie, don't lie on the ground,
you'll catch a cold!

804
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,794  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:515
Fuck you!
- Come off it, Charlie!

805
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,352  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:515
I hate her!
I hate her so, that swollen-headed cow!

806
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,670  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't be silly and get up!
- Leave me alone.

807
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,036  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
I said get up!
- I said leave me here.

808
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,870  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait for me!
I've lost my cable.

809
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,351  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:515
Does anybody have a spare one?
- But, Vladimír,

810
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,749  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
we could've by-passed
that hill along the green markers.

811
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,958  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
It won't harm them, the wise guys!

812
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,353  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:516
Excuse me, Miss, we'd like to pass onto
you our complaint.

813
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,236  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:510
Complaint?
What about?

814
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,156  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:510
About instructor Tits,
excuse me Titch.

815
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,319  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:510
Read it out!

816
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,275  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:448 Y2:516
In the course of today's ski programme
instructor Titch purposely overestimated

817
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,477  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:510
the endurance and skiing skills
of the first team.

818
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,955  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:516
Too intensive a pace without rest caused
Vicky Cabadaj to catch a cold,

819
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,313  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:515
Moravec to lose his cable,

820
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,830  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:483 Y2:510
Charlie Mácha to suffer a nervous shock

821
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,078  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:447 Y2:516
and Radek Pfievrátil to break his
cross-country ski.

822
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,035  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:510
We therefore demand replacement
of the broken ski

823
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,790  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:510
and handing over the complaint
to the head of the course.

824
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,239  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, Betty?

825
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,038  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't know what happened there.
- But I know.

826
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,954  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:516
The gentlemen here expected to spend

827
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,956  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
to spend the whole trip in a bar-room
as they're accustomed to.

828
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,115  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:516
So they can't forgive me now
for having made it a bit rough for them,

829
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,111  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:510
isn't that so, Vicky?
- Don't touch me!

830
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,397  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky, stop carrying on like that,
this is asking for trouble.

831
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,832  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Just as I thought!

832
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,469  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
When we want justice,
you say we're asking for trouble.

833
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,235  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's no use, nobody'll listen.

834
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,079  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who's for dancing?

835
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,195  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gee...
Make room!

836
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,513  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
What now?

837
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,634  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:516
Only for minimum stakes today.

838
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,593  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:510
Careful!

839
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,553  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come in!

840
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,954  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
What are you doing here,
apart from the others?

841
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,599  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:510
After he did this to us?

842
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,159  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're being silly.

843
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,794  X1:122 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't you really see that if you give
that complaint to Karda,

844
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,634  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
he'll consider it a provocation
and will side with Vladimír anyway.

845
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,513  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:516
I thought as much that it would end this
way.

846
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,629  X1:108 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:516
But why doesn't anybody believe us?
- Yes, why?

847
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,558  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
The Big Brains is not coming back
tonight.

848
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,875  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
Oh, excuse me, Miss,
we didn't know that...

849
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,433  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:448 Y2:510
It's all right.
Come in...

850
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,999  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:448 Y2:510
May we?
- Sure.

851
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,638  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:510
Come in and sit down.
- Can I sit here?

852
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,551  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whose is it?
- Why d'you wonder that nobody

853
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,312  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
believes you?
Can't you do without booze

854
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,833  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:510
at least for
a little while?

855
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,512  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's not a question of booze.

856
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,835  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:515
It's the feeling of being able
to take a drink, of the -

857
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,399  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:510
of the freedom.

858
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,991  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't you think it funny?

859
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,757  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:510
To speak in one breath about freedom
and booze?

860
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,593  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why all this fuss about booze?

861
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,558  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:510
We just think it's humiliating
when Karda carries on

862
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,995  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:510
because of one glass as if we were
little children.

863
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,275  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
But Karda can't give you permission
anyway and besides,

864
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,517  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
and besides,
you never know when to stop.

865
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,990  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:516
You have some opinion of us, Miss...

866
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,515  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:516
What d'you really think of us, Miss?

867
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,357  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:510
You mean seriously?
Yes.

868
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,189  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't know just how to put it,
but...

869
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,472  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:510
...it seems to me that...

870
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,269  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:516
you're more interested in appearances
than in what you re actually doing.

871
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,357  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:516
That you're never enthusiastic about
anything

872
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,357  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
and you're not willing to put up
a fight.

873
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,035  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
Except...
maybe to jump the line for the ski lift.

874
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,279  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
But that's because we don't want
to waste time standing in a queue.

875
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,159  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:510
Do we?

876
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,673  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes,

877
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,271  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
you want to be lifted quickly up to
the top of the hill

878
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,191  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:510
and then everybody goes downhill along
the beaten track.

879
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,632  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:515
That's not much, is it?
- Yes, but adults are no different.

880
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,199  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
I agree, but you seem to be too much
like them too soon.

881
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,355  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is all wrong.

882
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,232  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:510
You hold it against us that we are like
adults too soon.

883
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,439  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:516
And when we behave differently,
you simply forbid us to do so.

884
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,270  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
You hold it against us that we're not
willing to put up a fight,

885
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,352  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
but when we want to give Karda our
complaint, you're against it.

886
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,755  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:516
You say we wouldn't know when to stop
boozing

887
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,156  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
and so you rather won't alow allow us
to even begin.

888
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,599  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
So will you have one with us?
Just a drop?

889
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,358  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
Miss, don't be afraid we won t tell
anyone.

890
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,271  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
You know everything, anyway.
- Miss?

891
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,998  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
All right, but on condition that

892
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,718  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:510
there'll be no carrying on after lights
out.

893
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,195  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:516
Okay, it's a deal.

894
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,795  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
A little toothpaste can't harm you.
- Well, what are we going to drink to?

895
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,673  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:510
To have Miss be the head of the course.
- Don't wish that on me!

896
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,593  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
That would be really great.

897
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,679  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:510
Let's drink to this ski course!

898
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,029  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
D'you really think your father can't
return tonight?

899
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,673  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:510
Of course not.

900
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,478  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:510
He's got a friend at the Eagle Chalet
he went to see.

901
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,714  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm taking a toboggan!
I've got a toboggan!

902
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,833  X1:301 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go!

903
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,198  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
Everybody look at me.
This is the way they go down a glacier.

904
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,599  X1:161 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
Miss, d'you want to try it too?
- Why not?

905
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,869  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:447 Y2:516
Vladimír, come too!
- Yes, coming.

906
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,752  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
Look out for the snowman!
- Marika!

907
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,878  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is it?
I wanted to apologize

908
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,473  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:510
for this afternoon.

909
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,670  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:448 Y2:516
I just don't understand how I could've...
hit you so hard...

910
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,399  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
It was nothing really.

911
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,158  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
No, I, I know that I've done it
all wrong.

912
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,073  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
I... I only want you to know that...

913
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,599  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:484 Y2:516
whenever you want you can call upon me

914
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,559  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
because I'll always be there.

915
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,593  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Gee, it's freezing!

916
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,189  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's race!
- Okay, but we start up here.

917
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,039  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:510
Here, quick!
- We could later...

918
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,792  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
We should be getting ready for lights
out.

919
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,638  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:510
Does it make so much difference?

920
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,276  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here, I don't intend to go chasing
students all over the place at midnight.

921
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,439  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sonia, go on!
All right, let's drive them indoors.

922
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,869  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
Drive them in yourself.
You're the teacher on duty.

923
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,508  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I'm not going to be the bad 'un
who's always forbidding them things.

924
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,589  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:448 Y2:516
Kids!
Let's go to bed!

925
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,958  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
Lights out in a few minutes.

926
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,358  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop it, you promised me you'd observe
lights out.

927
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,395  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:516
Radek, why don't you say something?

928
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,833  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go to bed!

929
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,829  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop it!
You promised so come on!

930
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,158  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
Folks, come off it,
we have to get bed

931
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,800  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
so that our teachers get their beauty
sleep, otherwise we re in for it!

932
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,314  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's get to bed!
We promised!

933
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,513  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:516
We'll have that race tomorrow, okay?

934
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,279  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:510
We're going, we're going.
- You see it can be done.

935
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,833  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:510
Since we made a deal...

936
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,435  X1:094 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:516
And what about you two?
D'you intend to stay outdoors all night?

937
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,871  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're coming in right away.
- Well, don't forget to lock the door.

938
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,596  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
It was a lost battle from the beginning,
anyway.

939
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,433  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've also given up on her.

940
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,230  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't be sore, but that was a silly idea
that card game of yours.

941
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,676  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
What was silly?
What was silly?

942
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,548  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:516
It was only a joke,
from the very beginning.

943
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,996  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sure.
- What was silly?

944
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,873  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
It was a joke.

945
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,673  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come in.

946
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,839  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
So boys, good night.

947
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,675  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I'm relying on our agreement.
- Certainly.

948
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,279  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
Sure, we're coming.

949
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,553  X1:336 X2:382 Y1:484 Y2:510
So.

950
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,668  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gee...
Here we are...

951
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,879  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait for us.
- Sonia, hurry up!

952
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,116  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
Be quiet, Hanka's not asleep yet.

953
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,355  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
You know what they're writing in this
textbook, Betty?

954
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,959  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:515
No, I do not.

955
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,318  X1:080 X2:639 Y1:448 Y2:516
The ski course can best be terminated by
an optimistic yell.

956
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,633  X1:126 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
And d'you know what I thought of?

957
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,753  X1:150 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
Betty and I will be happy to say
good-bye!

958
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,109  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't frown, d'you hear me?

959
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,159  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
There's not a creak to be heard from
them tonight.

960
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,958  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
So let's play for forfeits.
And here we have a cardigan.

961
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,876  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let's get going.
And who's next in line?

962
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,279  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:448 Y2:510
Sonia!
Sonia!

963
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,990  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sonia, you'll now tell us when you last
kissed a boy.

964
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,751  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:515
No, I won't... no, no, I won't.

965
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,676  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:510
In that case you have to get up and kiss
the stoker.

966
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,116  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:448 Y2:510
What?
The stoker?

967
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,668  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:510
No, no, not the stoker!
- Stoker! Stoker!

968
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,991  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
Does anybody want more to drink?
- No, that's okay.

969
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,631  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:515
The stoker in no case.
- No, no, no...

970
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,677  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
Then you have to forfeit something.
- Don't be silly.

971
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,558  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:515
I'm almost naked.
- C'mon, take it off!

972
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,317  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
I also had to!
- So give us the blouse!

973
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,596  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't be fresh!
- Give it to me!

974
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,751  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:516
Just a bit more...
I've got it!

975
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,992  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
She's given up.
Not voluntarily, but she's given up.

976
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,279  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:516
And let's go on!

977
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,073  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who's next in line?
Eugen!

978
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,115  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop pawing her!
I've got an excellent task for you.

979
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,195  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
Get up and stoke the boiler.

980
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,593  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're cold again, aren't you?

981
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,591  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:515
Come, I'll make you a cup of tea.
- No, no.

982
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,717  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:510
Why not?
We can have coffee.

983
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,557  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't think I should...
- What's wrong with it?

984
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,958  X1:130 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
But we don't know each other well
enough...

985
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,713  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:516
What d'you mean, enough?

986
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,638  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
All I want to do is make you a cup
of tea.

987
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,631  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:510
You'll drink it and then go to bed,
that's all.

988
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,355  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:447 Y2:516
No, Vladimír, really not.
The girls'd notice.

989
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:05,117  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good night.
- Good night.

990
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,276  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why don't we get on with the damned
game?

991
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,119  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you listening to me?

992
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,119  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
I think I've had enough.

993
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,675  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, he's spilt it all over me?

994
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,995  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:515
Look, Marika!
- Gee, Marika!

995
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,116  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hi, Marika!
- What's she doing here?

996
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,754  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:448 Y2:510
And where were you and what did you do
there?

997
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,513  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
And how is he, tell us.
- Weren't you cold outside doing it?

998
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,075  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
Girls, give me the key to our room.
I want to go to bed.

999
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,356  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:516
Alone?
- You want the key?

1000
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,432  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
And what do we get in return?
- Have a drink, it'll soften you up.

1001
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,357  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:510
Look here, Marika, Marika, look here,
Marika.

1002
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,397  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait a minute.
We're playing the truth game.

1003
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,596  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, either you tell us the truth...

1004
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,395  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give me that key,
I really want to go to bed!

1005
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,155  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:515
Don't be ashamed, tell us how it was!

1006
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,033  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:516
Catch!
- Or you forfeit something.

1007
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,716  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give me that key!
- Would you like...

1008
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,114  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
Leave her alone.
Sex is exhausting.

1009
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,873  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
I really want to go to bed.

1010
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,588  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
C'mon!
Try at least a little!

1011
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,356  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
She's stupid.
- Where's she going?

1012
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,510  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let her be.
- Give it to me.

1013
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,350  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:510
What's got into you?
- Give it to me!

1014
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,759  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait a minute!
Where are you going!

1015
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,353  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait!
D'you hear me?

1016
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,952  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:516
Just one moment.
I hope you don't

1017
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,473  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
want to give it to her free.

1018
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,039  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:510
What is it?

1019
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,078  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
It makes your mind boggle.

1020
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,237  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:447 Y2:510
Vladimír, I think I'd like that cup
of tea.

1021
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:10,349  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, come in.

1022
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,959  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come in.

1023
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,075  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it?
Come on!

1024
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,633  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:516
Be quiet!

1025
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,153  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
Can you hear anything?

1026
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,753  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:515
C'mon, let's leave here.

1027
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,279  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it?
What is it?

1028
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,873  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:515
I'm defending the honour of fallen
women, aren't I?

1029
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,639  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here, Vicky, leave it alone.
That would be filthy, let it be.

1030
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,996  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here, I mean.
The girl's seventeen,

1031
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,752  X1:115 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:510
her father goes away and leaves her
on her own.

1032
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,593  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
I won't have this on my conscience.
- You're right, Vicky, we're with you.

1033
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,829  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:447 Y2:510
No, Vladimír, don't please...
- Don't be afraid.

1034
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,555  X1:328 X2:390 Y1:484 Y2:510
No...

1035
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,279  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:510
Marika...

1036
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,753  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:510
What is it?

1037
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,359  X1:295 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:510
Bastards!

1038
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,753  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:516
Creeps!

1039
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,548  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:483 Y2:516
Novák, are you all right?

1040
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,675  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, you twit!
- All right there?

1041
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,793  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:510
He's an idiot.

1042
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,436  X1:153 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:516
Because of him I've swallowed
my chewing gum.

1043
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,793  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:516
So get out.

1044
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,590  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is it?
Look, somebody's lying over there.

1045
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,473  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:515
Girls, come over here!

1046
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,593  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hurry up!

1047
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,997  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:516
My god, it's Charlie.
Charlie, wake up!

1048
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,513  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
What's wrong with him?

1049
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,119  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:510
But he's drunk!

1050
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,959  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
Everybody be quiet!

1051
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,833  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm dizzy too.

1052
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,953  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's terribly cold.
- I think we should carry him inside.

1053
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,678  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let him be.
I don't think we should move him.

1054
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,155  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:516
We don't know what's wrong with him.
- Shut up and take hold of him.

1055
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,630  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
Stop making a racket please.

1056
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,832  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:510
Put the light out, you idiot!
- Let's call Hanka.

1057
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,751  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:515
Are you out of your mind?
- Well then, let's call Vladimír.

1058
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,353  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll only squeak to Karda.

1059
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,393  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
If the teacher finds us here we'll all
get thrown out of school.

1060
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,232  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's breathing.
What if he s really dying?

1061
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,117  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:516
We'll have to call the mountain
emergency service or a doctor...

1062
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,079  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:515
For chrissake, calm down!

1063
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:09,675  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:516
Be quiet!

1064
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,115  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:515
Charlie, come on, Charlie.

1065
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,596  X1:142 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:510
How much did he have to drink?
- He rank rum.

1066
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,874  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:516
And how much?
Does anybody know how much?

1067
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,873  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:510
That could be alcohol poisoning.
He could die of that.

1068
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,752  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
My parents'll kill me for this.
They'll just kill me.

1069
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,752  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
As far as I can tell all the rum's gone.
- But I only had one glass.

1070
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,558  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
Save him, somebody.
- D'you hear me, Vicky, save him!

1071
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,952  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm going to get Hanka.
- Don't be silly, Radek.

1072
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,357  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:516
D'you hear me, don't be silly.
- I'm going, Vicky, it's no good.

1073
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,318  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm telling you, don't do it.

1074
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,199  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:447 Y2:510
Who knows how much Novák's had
out of that bottle.

1075
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,759  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:516
What if it really is poisoning.

1076
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,956  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:510
We can't help him ourselves.
- Just wait till we're clear.

1077
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,588  X1:325 X2:394 Y1:484 Y2:510
Wait!

1078
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,152  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
The idiot went for her.
- What?

1079
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,959  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:510
What a nitwit!

1080
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,710  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
But he's drunk!
- No, that's not possible.

1081
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,279  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
And you too, aren't you?

1082
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,118  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
I... I really didn't drink anything...

1083
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,270  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
Well, well...
Can you explain this?

1084
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,958  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:516
What in god's name were you doing?

1085
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,951  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
How could he get into such a state?

1086
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,633  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:510
Who's there?

1087
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,070  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look here, young man.

1088
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,669  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:484 Y2:516
I maybe pissed,

1089
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,555  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
but I'm not that drunk for you to run
away without paying.

1090
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,593  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, Radek?

1091
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,798  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
We'II... we'll pay you,
we'll really will...

1092
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,036  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
"Why,, we", young man? "

1093
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,152  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
You ordered, you pay up!

1094
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,557  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
Five hundred and fifty net.

1095
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,071  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:515
Service inclusive, Miss.

1096
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,593  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:510
Who was here?

1097
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,034  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
Vicky, Charlie, who else?
- Nobody.

1098
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,032  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
All right, as you like.

1099
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:43,199  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:510
What's the meaning of this?
- What?

1100
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,837  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop play-acting!
- Has anything happened?

1101
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,958  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:484 Y2:516
You know that yourself best, don't you?

1102
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,756  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why me?
Why always me?

1103
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,553  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:516
Stop making believe that you're asleep.

1104
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,039  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
You too.
Fast asleep, aren't you?

1105
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,958  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, everybody's fast asleep...
- What is it?

1106
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,673  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know.
- What's going on?

1107
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,274  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're normally asleep.
- Nobody knows anything.

1108
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,992  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:510
I want to get some sleep and can't.
- Isn't that so?

1109
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,480  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
Has anything happened, Miss?
- All at once, everybody was asleep.

1110
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,120  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:510
I really don't know what's going on.
- What's the matter?

1111
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,390  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is terrible.
They wake you up after midnight.

1112
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,039  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:510
Isn't that so, Vicky?
- So.

1113
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,791  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:510
And now tell me who was downstairs.

1114
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,471  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:510
And where downstairs?
- You don't know?

1115
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,513  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
What?

1116
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,473  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm waiting.

1117
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,992  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:516
Am I supposed to smell your breath...?

1118
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,948  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
...or d'you think I should take
fingerprints?

1119
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,230  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't you think this is disgusting?

1120
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,756  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
Why all this fuss?
- Yes?

1121
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,110  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
So all those bottles downstairs
were drunk by Radek.

1122
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,079  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
Alone.

1123
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,433  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
And you don't care a fig.

1124
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,713  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
You agree with it?

1125
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,593  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yes.

1126
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,959  X1:319 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:516
Okay.

1127
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,958  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
In that case you pack your things
and leave for home tomorrow morning.

1128
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,119  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's going on here?
- Nothing.

1129
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,873  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come and help me.
- He's really going home?

1130
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,239  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go to sleep.

1131
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,718  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
Wait a minute.
That stoker wants

1132
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,279  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
five hundred and fifty.
- What?

1133
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,039  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:510
We don't have that much.

1134
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,519  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is this?
A four-star hotel?

1135
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,356  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
This must be at least five stars.
Am I right?

1136
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,079  X1:106 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
But look here I had a maximum of two
glasses.

1137
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,471  X1:120 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:510
But folks, we're not going to pay for
it all

1138
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,352  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:510
when we've left half of it untouched.

1139
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,836  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait a minute,
I've got some money in my room.

1140
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,673  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:510
This is for both of us.

1141
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,792  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
Here, I'll give you this.
Is it enough?

1142
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,553  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm sorry I don't have any more.

1143
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,156  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:516
Look here, Radek,
I've only got ten crowns.

1144
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,999  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
Girls, what about you?

1145
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:59,351  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:447 Y2:516
Look, Novák, poured my drinks
so let him pay for me.

1146
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,754  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:510
I've only got twenty.
- Me too.

1147
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,956  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's go to sleep, everybody.

1148
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,877  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:510
I see trouble ahead.

1149
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,239  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
He has to sleep it off.

1150
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,996  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:448 Y2:510
How could he have got himself into such
a state.

1151
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,355  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know, but we have to put him on
his feet again, don't we?

1152
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,633  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes, indeed.

1153
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,118  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll help you with him.

1154
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,952  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:516
Please go to bed.

1155
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,952  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
And make sure you're quiet upstairs.

1156
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,999  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
Didn't you hear me?

1157
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,238  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:516
C'mon, Charlie, wake up, do'you hear me?
- How much are you short?

1158
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,753  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:510
About two hundred.

1159
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,955  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:516
No, that's...
- Are you sick...?

1160
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,678  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:448 Y2:516
Here.
Thank you.

1161
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,431  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:515
Marika, what is it?

1162
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,477  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:510
Nothing,
I don't feel well.

1163
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,473  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:448 Y2:510
Karda...
- Hello!

1164
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,039  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
Good morning, good morning.

1165
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,394  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hi!
- Hello!

1166
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,760  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it?
- Please don't ask.

1167
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,873  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is it?
- Come on, what's happened?

1168
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:09,109  X1:118 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:516
But the kids got hold of some booze
and Mácha got drunk.

1169
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,833  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:483 Y2:510
Mácha?

1170
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,238  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:510
In the end, Radek took all the blame
on himself and I sent him home.

1171
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,269  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:516
These things can be dealt with in other
ways, can't they?

1172
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,955  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've aged terribly overnight.

1173
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,840  X1:111 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
I've always dealt with such problems
on my own.

1174
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,036  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
All right,
but what was I supposed to do?

1175
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,551  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
But Betty, don't be naive.
- I know, but what d'you want to do?

1176
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,314  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:448 Y2:510
Miss?
- Yes?

1177
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,510  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
Miss, may I speak to you?

1178
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,672  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:447 Y2:510
What is it, Mácha?
- Radek is...

1179
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,593  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
What's happened?

1180
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,953  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's just that Radek's gone.

1181
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:09,671  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
What?
- What d'you mean, he s gone?

1182
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,673  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:510
What nonsense is this?

1183
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,318  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
I don't know.
When we woke up this morning,

1184
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,954  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:516
we thought that he was somewhere

1185
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,759  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:448 Y2:516
...and then we found that he'd packed
all his things.

1186
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,672  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's left this for you.

1187
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,678  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:510
We can reconcile ourselves to
what others do unto us.

1188
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:42,030  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
It is in what we do unto ourselves
that the difficulty lies.

1189
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,749  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:510
Attention!
- Students!

1190
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,156  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:510
Before we begin our daily programme,
allow me a few words.

1191
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:58,114  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:515
The fourth day tends to be critical
and, therefore,

1192
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,792  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
please be careful of falls.

1193
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,753  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
And Bob's your uncle!

1194
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,789  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
Dismissed!
