00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:08,253
THREE WISHES FOR
CINDERELLA

2
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,902
You put that back!

3
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,972
Of course...
Cinderella!

4
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,892
And the King will arrive
any minute!

5
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,769
Hurry up,
you slow-coaches!

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,751
Wait!

7
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,923
The King will arrive any minute
and nothing is prepared.

8
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:46,924
Hurry up!

9
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,974
What will the King think about us.

10
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,498
Don't soil your slippers,

11
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,793
and mind
you don't catch cold!

12
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:41,346
Pick it up and get out!

13
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,498
I don't know why I keep you!

14
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,234
Good boy.

15
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,774
I've brought you some sugar.

16
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,947
It's only three years
since daddy gave you to me!

17
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,079
I'd just love to take you
on a ride again,

18
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,456
but you know we are not allowed.

19
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,044
Everybody is excited,
they're expecting the King.

20
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,341
I'll come again
when I've finished my work.

21
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,518
Are they coming?

22
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,661
Hänschen!
Can you see them?

23
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:12,161
No!

24
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:14,498
Not a soul to be seen, madam!

25
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,164
Come and tell me as soon as
they appear below the forest!

26
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,832
Cinderella again, I bet!

27
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:39,590
You'll be the death of me,
silly fool!

28
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,448
Who did it?
The dish was cracked anyway, ma'am.

29
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,200
You' re not answering
my question!

30
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,429
It was I, mother,
please forgive me!

31
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:21,390
Rosi, everything prepared?

32
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,844
The meat, yes...
Chicken, wine, fruit...

33
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,763
Yes, madam, everything.

34
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,890
To please such guests
is quite a problem.

35
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,617
So see you don't spoil
anything.

36
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,067
I really don't know
if you' re so clumsy

37
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,919
or if you do it on purpose.

38
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,283
Some legacy your father left
me in you...

39
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,079
Like father like...
You leave daddy alone!

40
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,838
He has left you the whole farm!

41
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,917
How dare you speak to me
like that!

42
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,215
Did you hear that?

43
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,551
Kindly remember!

44
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:10,264
Gone are the times your father
took you to the forest,

45
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:14,101
riding and shooting
like a boy!

46
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,188
I am the mistress here now...

47
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,986
And keep away from that horse!

48
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,655
Give it to me!

49
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:38,874
Pick them apart by lunch-time
and then come and apologize!

50
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,839
I'll bring you down
a peg or two!

51
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,800
And woe betide you
if I catch sight of you

52
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,427
when the King is here!

53
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,222
Don't get all upset,
that's just grimy Cinderella!

54
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,610
Thanks, Cinderella...
I'll help you!

55
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,361
And leave me here alone?

56
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:14,828
Well, my girl, a step-mother is
always a step-mother...

57
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,290
But her Dora wasn't Daddy's,
and he loved her!

58
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,906
Dear friends...

59
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,286
The peas onto the basket,
the ashes into the pail...

60
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,706
...how good of you!

61
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,326
Looking for a lick, Pussy?

62
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,332
No, you can't go in now!

63
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,216
Can you manage than much?

64
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,723
Of course you can!

65
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,738
The gentry not arrived yet, Cinderella?

66
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,325
How did you know it is me?

67
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,538
I didn't, but Nikolaus did.
Knows you a mile off...

68
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,833
Why aren't you watching out
for royalty with the others?

69
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,087
I'm not to...

70
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,422
And I prefer being here anyway.

71
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,592
Not even curious to see the Prince?

72
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,553
I saw him last year...

73
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,137
When they stopped on the way
to the castle.

74
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,015
And did you like him?

75
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,936
Nikolaus is my favourite...

76
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,230
They' re coming!

77
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:29,857
Here they are!

78
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,904
Be good, children!

79
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,164
Everything all right, Dora dear?
Mind you show me the Prince!

80
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,365
Where are you off to, Silly-Billy?

81
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,576
You little poacher!

82
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,955
Go and welcome the King!

83
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,042
You know ve can't go hunting any more!

84
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,838
Nikolaus and I'll be right
back, sorun along!

85
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,685
Rosie!

86
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,697
Looking after my treasures?!

87
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,779
Nikolaus is calling me...

88
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,948
We have so little time, you see!

89
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,849
Quickly...
Bow low, and don't forget-smile!

90
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,434
All the time!

91
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,189
Where is the Prince, tutor?
And Carl and Willi?

92
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,274
I don't know, your Highness.

93
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,068
I was giving them a lecture
on elegant manners,

94
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:23,405
and in the forest
the gentleman disappeared...

95
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,965
Find them!
And blame them!

96
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,019
Wait I'll blame them myself!

97
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,791
Are your shooting skills gone?

98
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,657
Look...

99
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,412
Follow her...

100
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,651
There!

101
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,445
Let us surround her.
I will go this way, you take the right.

102
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:37,504
And you take the left.

103
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,117
Is that her?
There's none other here!

104
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,180
This is just a girl!

105
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:28,585
A fluffy chicken.

106
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:40,222
Look, she has claws!

107
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,615
Needs some klapps on her ass,
if you ask me!

108
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,108
That's what she can have!

109
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,313
None of that.
Stupid boys!

110
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,611
We will get you,
you cheeky girl!

111
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,996
You will not get me so easily.
Men!

112
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,353
Jump off, he'll throw you!

113
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,001
She'll break her neck!
This will come to a bad end.

114
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:22,352
Crazy girl!

115
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,938
We must find her!

116
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,031
Go back to your master!

117
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,327
Such a wildcat!

118
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:02,436
She deserves beating.
More a medal, gentlemen!

119
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,306
For putting one over on us!

120
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,391
Your Highness...

121
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,778
Your studies, Highness!

122
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,453
I can hardly express
how we looked forward

123
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,331
to your coming -
and her Highness the Queen

124
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,416
and also his Highness, the Prince...

125
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,836
and the whole entourage, and so on.

126
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,128
We thank you.

127
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,798
Dear Dora her could hardly sleep...

128
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:42,678
The Prince is not with you this time?

129
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,138
Oh yes...

130
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,394
Nature studies have detained
him on the way...

131
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,688
Pity...

132
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,648
All year we looked forward

133
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:58,443
to your stopping here
on the way to the castle.

134
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,612
I even had a dream...

135
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,615
that your royal Highness
invited us to the ball...

136
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,118
Dora and myself...

137
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,206
That your Highness smiled
at Dora and said:

138
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,126
Do come, my dear,
we shall be pleased to see you.

139
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,673
We shall be pleased to see you.

140
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,258
Our pleasure...

141
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,510
Thank you for the refreshment.

142
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,306
Yes, yes...
On our way!

143
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:36,648
This is an inexpressible honour for us!

144
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,367
That's in the bag...
And who knows, amongst all

145
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,078
those noblemen
someone might notice you...

146
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:55,167
Maybe even the Prince himself!
Why not?

147
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,126
Carrying on like a little boy!

148
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,879
At your age I was...

149
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:43,257
...carrying the burdens
of a ruler!

150
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,678
You'll come down a peg or two
when we get you married!

151
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,055
That's tamed other rebels!

152
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,767
I honour your experience...

153
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,148
Hadn't we better talk this over at home?

154
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,071
I hoped you would devote yourselves

155
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,991
to the study of diplomacy and
court etiquette...

156
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,662
We try not to waste a minute!

157
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:18,834
But studies are a demanding business!

158
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,089
Where have you left your tutor?

159
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,259
He must have wandered off again...

160
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,767
Stop!

161
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,149
Are those just threats
or does he really want me to marry?

162
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,403
This time he really means it.

163
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:30,113
A roll of fine line, gold thread,
velvet, thirty ells, in dark blue...

164
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,952
I don't want velvet,
I want satin!

165
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,411
The velvet is for me, Dora.

166
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:40,749
And forty ells of the best
satin in sky blue.

167
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,502
That's not enough.
Get fifty, then.

168
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:49,424
Oh, and wide gold braid.

169
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,385
And silver buckles for my
slippers!

170
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,637
Tell the dressmaker you'll
fetch her day after tomorrow.

171
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,348
Don't forget anything!

172
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,599
Yes.

173
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,140
Cinderella, you'll freeze!

174
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,350
Did the mistress make you...

175
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,353
Who else?

176
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,399
And what shall I get you in town?

177
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,277
A tiara and pearls and
a robe with a train!

178
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,448
I can just see them both persuading me
to go to the ball with them...

179
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,075
Surely you wouldn't cry for that...

180
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:03,207
If I could, I'd bring you
whatever you wished...

181
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:04,875
Honestly, I would...

182
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:10,088
Well then bring me the first thing,
that hits you on the nose!

183
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,216
All right, then!

184
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,790
The Lady at Sparrow accepted
our invitation?

185
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:48,252
Indeed, the messenger has just arrived!

186
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,879
And the Princess of Rosestone?

187
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:56,051
Definitely coming with both daughters,
Miss Liza and Miss Loulou.

188
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,595
The younger one's
at least thirty!

189
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,099
She is a year younger
than you, and very sweet!

190
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,684
Which you are not!

191
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,854
And the Baron's widow
from Krakau?

192
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,484
She promised to bring
all three daughters.

193
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:17,447
I thought it was to be a ball,
but this looks more like a man-hunt!

194
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,575
Your impertinence is unseemly!

195
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,870
I apologize for my frankness,
but I was brought up to speak

196
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,580
the truth.
May I leave?

197
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,461
You'll first hear me out!

198
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:37,467
I had no idea the family
council would take so long.

199
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,721
The tutor and my friends
are waiting,

200
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,514
may I dismiss them?

201
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,892
What was so important...?

202
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,482
We were to study history...
then I was to have suffered

203
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,363
a lesson in etiquette and
witty conversation...

204
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:03,243
History? Conversation?

205
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,497
Aren't you shooting fun of me?

206
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,293
Shoot-fun-how could I?

207
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,504
Here you are...

208
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,098
Horses away...!

209
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,560
Why the cross-bows, then?

210
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,189
Call that study?

211
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,234
Of course he doesn't want to
marry,

212
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,736
fooling round on a horse
all day with cross bows!

213
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,364
Horse and cross-bows?
How's that?

214
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,574
Come and see!

215
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,375
Gentlemen, I'm responsible
for you,

216
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,670
your studies,
state interests

217
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,215
I don't understand...

218
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,975
Don't forget to practice
dance-steps,

219
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,060
so you don't
cut a sorry figure!

220
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,728
Remember, I at your age...

221
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,814
...danced through three pairs
of slippers at a ball!

222
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:15,148
Really?

223
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,901
Before we mer, of course...

224
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:23,073
But you apologized that
it was the first time

225
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:26,618
you were dancing,
when you trod on my feet.

226
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,497
That is nothing to brag of to a son...

227
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:36,378
My dear, he takes after you...
in all the important things!

228
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,923
No!
Yes!

229
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,815
After the dancing lesson,
some conversation!

230
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,150
Ah, conversation...

231
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:03,780
Your Highness,

232
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,241
I have decided, that you will ask for
my hand in marriage.

233
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,618
Do you agree?

234
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,870
No, my beautiful Countess.

235
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,040
I honour your ancien family
and your great beauty,

236
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,877
but my heart belongs forever
to hunting, shooting and riding.

237
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,004
So the wedding-is no go.

238
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:27,262
Or as the poet says:
No rain from that cloud!

239
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:31,892
Or as that kid said:
When the cows come home!

240
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,144
Look...

241
00:31:37,036 --> 00:31:39,189
Gentlemen!

242
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,827
We' re off!

243
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:55,465
What about your studies?!

244
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,215
My dear girl,
I nearly forgot!

245
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,768
Like a spider's web...

246
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,774
Stand back...
turn round!

247
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,238
And you hurry!

248
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:03,710
Look, Cinderella,
they hit the tip of my nose

249
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,129
just as I dreamt
I was off to your wedding...

250
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,257
What did you give her?

251
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,218
Show me!

252
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:20,102
Nice present!
Like for a squirrel!

253
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:31,613
The bodice...

254
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,367
Mummy, you forgot the lace!

255
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,336
And a new necklace!
And earrings!

256
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:44,168
Mumy, you can't send
a this man to buy cloth!

257
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:45,878
That's true...

258
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,263
We'll go to town ourselves.
Yes, Ma'am.

259
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:51,717
Put the horse to
the buggy!

260
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,764
Would you like to come to
town with us, Cinderella?

261
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:01,393
You'd only scare people off!

262
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,397
Stop staring!
Sveep up properly!

263
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,531
I said properly, understand?

264
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,499
Stop that at once!

265
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,518
Be a good boy...

266
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,439
Wait here, I'll go and see Rosie...

267
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:49,084
You lucky thing,
flying where you want to...

268
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,175
I'd so like to see where he goes...

269
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,429
But how can I, like this?

270
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,367
All this is mine?

271
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,295
Don't be afraid of me!
This was all inside the nut!

272
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,881
Ho do I look, Silly-Billy?

273
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,605
The first shot!

274
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,113
Great, one more bird of prey

275
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,825
and your Highness is
the King of the Hunt!

276
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:32,349
The King awards this
precious ring

277
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,985
to the huntsman who first
shoots down a bird of prey!

278
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,889
Good luck.

279
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,034
First shot!

280
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:16,441
Second shot!
Third!

281
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,366
Your turn, Prince!

282
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,501
Too high

283
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,546
Whose arrow is it?

284
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:12,908
Highness!

285
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,598
It was me, forgive me.

286
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,009
Who are you?

287
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,929
I thought you do not want to fire!

288
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:40,786
Quite an ordinary one.

289
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,655
Do we continue with the hunt?

290
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:47,109
The best marksman has shown
us his art -

291
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,819
the ring!

292
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,995
It is yours by rights!

293
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,423
Or can you do better still?

294
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:12,593
I am sorry that you are cross...

295
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,265
Do you see those cones at the tip?

296
00:43:19,808 --> 00:43:21,601
Would you dare?

297
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,648
Here any bit of a girl can do that.

298
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,402
My horse!

299
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,722
Did a young hunter go this way?

300
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:42,349
Why?

301
00:44:43,642 --> 00:44:45,143
Did he or did he not?

302
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:49,439
No, far and wide nothing but
a fluffy kitten,

303
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,150
a cheeky kid!

304
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,944
Come on down!
You come up!

305
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,291
We've met before, haven't we?

306
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,668
You'd have to remind me where!

307
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:11,670
Here in the wood, you little lizzard!

308
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:13,672
You won't escape today!

309
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:20,971
Where is he?
Where?

310
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,598
She'll tell us!

311
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:27,755
Where's she gone to?

312
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,573
Who?

313
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:33,066
That girl,
we couldn't catch last time.

314
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,122
Pass the buttons, Cinderella!

315
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:53,086
Cinderella, the silver thread!

316
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,634
Cinderella, the necklace!

317
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,934
Come on!

318
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,313
I want the carpet out,
right up to the sleigh!

319
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:12,356
Yes, m' am.

320
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:20,697
Well?
Lovely...

321
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:23,617
Just beautiful, Dora dear...

322
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,327
My hat!

323
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,914
Would you like to come
with us to the ball?

324
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,500
Say, would you?

325
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,795
I know you wouldn't take me inside.

326
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,465
But could I just have a peep...
through the window?

327
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,804
And who'll do the cleaning here?

328
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,557
I'd get it all done by morning.

329
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:52,771
If you haven't enough to do
... there!

330
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:04,658
I want it all gone
when we' re back!

331
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:08,829
The lentils picked
from the corn!

332
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:22,885
I'lltell you

333
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,928
how many times I danced
with the Prince!

334
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,263
Hold my train!

335
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:31,518
You'd better hold it yourself.
I could soil it.

336
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:03,300
Don't be sad,
I'll dance with you after supper.

337
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,521
You go and get us something to eat!

338
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,481
Your word is my command, Highness!

339
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:25,656
You' re sorry you can't go, aren't you?
I know...

340
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:29,785
But I can't help you.

341
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:43,465
It'lltake me a week to pick
these apart...

342
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:10,993
...you've come to help me?

343
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:15,539
The corn into the basket,
lentils into the bowl!

344
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,045
What would I have done without you.

345
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,180
Thank you!

346
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,569
Daddy always laughed that

347
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,197
I'd ride to my first ball
on Nikolaus, like a Hussar.

348
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:54,703
And my mummy promised me
a pretty dress,

349
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:57,498
as pink as
the red evening sky...

350
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,461
And all that's left to me is
Nikolaus.

351
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,594
No, I have lots of other things...

352
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:15,307
three magic hazel-nuts...
no, only two...

353
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,188
Rosie, do you think...?

354
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:09,695
How did you get here,
and who saddled you?

355
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:20,706
The noble Lady of the Black
Forest, with daughter...

356
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:25,085
Baroness of Shortwood
with grand-daughter...

357
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:30,549
Lady of Edge
with daughters...

358
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,642
Don't look so sour!
Smile!

359
00:51:45,564 --> 00:51:48,025
I'd like to know which one
you'd be smiling at,

360
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,568
if you had to marry her.

361
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,154
Dad, let's postpone it for a year...

362
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,659
Listen to him!
And this is to be my successor!

363
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:00,370
Do choose a more convenient
time for quarrelling!

364
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:10,964
Did you notice how he smiled at you?

365
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,471
I made no such fuss
when I got married!

366
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:21,433
But you married mummy...
and you force strange girls onto me...

367
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,486
The noble Lady of Gotham with niece...

368
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,572
You'd better give rein
to your temperament on the dance-floor.

369
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,243
I don't care,
you point to one, I'll ask her...

370
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:50,671
His Highness now asks you
to start the dance.

371
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,464
Music!

372
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,522
Come on, that's impolite!

373
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,441
Look, that pretty blonde
with the blue train...

374
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,611
Or the brunette in yellow...

375
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,324
How can I choose!

376
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,660
I'll choose blindly!

377
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:09,791
Clumsy girl, you' re so slow!

378
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,551
May I have the pleasure?

379
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:47,704
I knew nothing of
the Prince's taste, it seems.

380
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,347
Did you come from afar?

381
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,307
The distance was no greater

382
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,144
than my longing to dance
with your Highness!

383
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,647
In spite of my treading
on your toes?

384
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,316
That is an hour for me, Highness.

385
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:24,619
I would dance with you
till the end of the world.

386
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,597
What courage!

387
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:29,491
I can land you as much as you like!

388
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:32,578
I don't make debts, young lady!

389
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,483
You think I should go in?

390
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:13,118
Shall I, shall I not,
shall I, shall I not...

391
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,870
I shall...

392
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,457
Well, I'll give it a try...

393
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,719
Don't be cross, I'm going!

394
00:59:30,154 --> 00:59:32,156
Mind out!

395
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:46,795
Have pity on him!
Let him stew a bit.

396
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,459
Out of breath?

397
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,085
I'll have them play something faster.

398
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,296
Have them play what you like!
I've finished dancing!

399
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:45,938
Go back and dance!
I'd rather fell trees!

400
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:48,315
All right, start at once!

401
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,276
As you like!

402
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:56,615
Good evening, your Highness!

403
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,410
Thank you for a wonderful welcome!

404
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:03,413
I... you see...

405
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,250
I'm sorry, you surprised me...

406
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:09,086
I thought you were
running out to meet me...

407
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,713
No, I was just running out...

408
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:15,217
In that case I shan't keep you...

409
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,470
But I don't want to any longer...

410
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,181
May I have the pleasure?

411
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:24,184
Wouldn't it go better with music?

412
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,188
Why aren't they playing?

413
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,751
Who are you?

414
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,463
Do you want to question me,
or to dance?

415
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,179
Who can it be?

416
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:03,348
We'll see.

417
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,435
Our boy forgot all about
the trees he wanted to fell!

418
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,103
Look how graceful she is!

419
01:02:08,729 --> 01:02:10,272
Shall I ask her up?

420
01:02:10,856 --> 01:02:13,734
Let her dance a while...
With that clumsy boy of ours?

421
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:15,736
You may be surprised!

422
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:23,827
Do you know who it is?
I don't...

423
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:37,674
Why doesn't she take that veil off?
Probably hiding a big nose!

424
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:52,147
Take off that veil, then!

425
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,290
Is this my son?

426
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,751
He is only doing what you asked...

427
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,670
But who is she?

428
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:17,965
You are more impatient than your son.

429
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:38,861
At least give me a hint!

430
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:42,614
Why do you want to know?

431
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:48,328
Because I have just chosen a bride
and I know not who she is...

432
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,540
Not so loud, they are listening!
Let them hear!

433
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,292
I'll call right out into the world...

434
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:58,589
that I'm in love...
and getting married...!

435
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:01,717
But you forgot something!
What?

436
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,386
To ask the bride if she wants you!

437
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:06,930
You'd give me the mitten?

438
01:04:08,474 --> 01:04:10,476
A bit of cheek, what?

439
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,741
Will you have me, or not?

440
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:21,536
I'll give you a riddle,
and if you guess...

441
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:25,449
First time: Face smuged with ashes,
but it's no huntsman?

442
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:40,672
What on earth...
Calm down, you'll find out...

443
01:04:41,882 --> 01:04:44,051
Third time:

444
01:04:44,343 --> 01:04:49,598
A dress embroidered in silver,
but she's not a Princess!

445
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:58,106
Pity...

446
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:02,194
Until you know the answer
to my riddle -

447
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,488
Goodbye!

448
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:20,087
What happened?
Why did she run off?

449
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,096
What if he's fallen in love?

450
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:49,533
That was your wish.
Without my permission?

451
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:51,827
I'd like to see that!

452
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:56,915
You didn't obey your parents either,
and brought me home, my love...

453
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,378
Why aren't they playing?
Play!

454
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:02,963
Music, please!

455
01:06:52,803 --> 01:06:54,305
Get the horses, quickly!

456
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:30,934
Open up!

457
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:32,205
Come on, open up!

458
01:08:37,673 --> 01:08:42,593
What's wrong?
Open up!

459
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:56,449
What do you want?

460
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,344
We have not come in enmity...

461
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:08,272
Why, then?

462
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:13,194
Who is the master of this house?
No master-a mistress!

463
01:09:13,277 --> 01:09:15,822
But she's at the Palace ball
with her daughter!

464
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:19,742
Staring like an owl -
let him say what he wants!

465
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:21,953
That beautiful Princess!

466
01:09:22,328 --> 01:09:24,121
Princess?
Here?

467
01:09:25,998 --> 01:09:27,583
She rode in a moment before me!

468
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:30,586
Let him find his Princess, then!

469
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:38,469
I don't know if she's a Princess,
but she is beautiful...

470
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:40,680
and somewhere here I lost her!

471
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:46,185
We have droves of beauties here Sir!

472
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:48,020
Just to choose the right one!

473
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,939
Come and make your choice,
you tenderfoot!

474
01:09:50,022 --> 01:09:52,150
Or get out of here!

475
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:54,819
That's not bad advice, your Highness!
Let's wait till daybreak!

476
01:09:54,902 --> 01:09:57,822
Mornings make for wiser decisions!
What now-at night!

477
01:09:57,905 --> 01:10:00,283
No, I must find her!

478
01:10:01,075 --> 01:10:03,995
I want to see all the girls
of this farmstead!

479
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,873
By what right, Sir?

480
01:10:07,748 --> 01:10:12,587
It's the Prince!
Oh, the Prince... Your Highness...

481
01:10:13,462 --> 01:10:15,423
Every single girl!

482
01:10:15,506 --> 01:10:17,925
Here they are, your Highness!

483
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:24,015
Now I wonder what you'll do!

484
01:10:24,223 --> 01:10:26,601
She had a veil...
... a rose-pink dress!

485
01:10:29,437 --> 01:10:31,189
Stop!

486
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:35,693
What's he doing here?
Looking for someone.

487
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:56,506
...you don't know her face...
... nor her name...

488
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:00,468
I'll recognize her by the slipper...

489
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:03,638
The girl whom this slipper fits
will be my wife!

490
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:05,890
Your foot!

491
01:11:10,394 --> 01:11:11,854
Next!

492
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:22,532
That's too small even for a doll...

493
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:28,204
Leave off, you silly fool!

494
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:31,749
Have they all tried it on?

495
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:35,795
There's one more here!
You dupe...

496
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,549
Is there really no one other here?

497
01:11:40,675 --> 01:11:43,135
Of course there is,
your Highness - Cinderella!

498
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:47,431
Yes, Cinderella!

499
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:49,976
Why hasn't she shown up?
Where can she be?

500
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:52,103
I haven't seen her all evening!
Cinderella!

501
01:11:52,186 --> 01:11:53,604
She had to pick the corn
from the lentils!

502
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:56,065
We must find her!
Cinderella!

503
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:07,910
Come!
Wait here!

504
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:23,593
Take that rope!
What for?

505
01:12:34,937 --> 01:12:36,772
Do you think she's in there?

506
01:12:42,278 --> 01:12:44,280
Ah, here you are!

507
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:50,912
Cinderella!

508
01:12:54,665 --> 01:12:56,125
She isn't here, either...

509
01:13:02,673 --> 01:13:04,133
Cinderella!

510
01:13:08,054 --> 01:13:09,806
Cinderella, where are you?!

511
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:32,619
Unsaddle him and rub him down!

512
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,839
Your Highness!

513
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,014
Halt!

514
01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:58,229
So it wasn't a vain search!
I shan't let you go now!

515
01:13:58,354 --> 01:13:59,897
Why did you come here?

516
01:14:00,314 --> 01:14:03,067
To find her!
Why did you search for her?

517
01:14:03,442 --> 01:14:04,902
To ask her to marry me!

518
01:14:04,986 --> 01:14:06,946
What prevents you from doing so?

519
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:09,490
Unveil her face!

520
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:11,784
Why?
So I know her!

521
01:14:11,993 --> 01:14:14,328
She is dressed just as at the ball...
the dress, tiara, veil...

522
01:14:14,412 --> 01:14:17,665
Why does she not speak?
After you put a ring on her finger!

523
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:19,792
Let her try the slipper on!

524
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,130
Let her try the slipper!

525
01:14:25,798 --> 01:14:28,259
Why won't she try on
her own slipper?

526
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:33,097
She is shy!

527
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:35,433
Do you want to marry her or not?

528
01:14:36,517 --> 01:14:37,977
After she's tried on the slipper!

529
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:42,690
Drive off!

530
01:15:15,223 --> 01:15:20,144
He'll follow us, you'll see.
In the end he'll do as I want!

531
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:15,783
Help me!

532
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,828
Catch hold of my hand...

533
01:16:27,211 --> 01:16:28,880
You are not my bride!

534
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:07,627
Help me out!

535
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:12,173
I'm coming, Ma'am!

536
01:17:14,884 --> 01:17:17,136
Do you see anything?
There's something in there...

537
01:17:18,304 --> 01:17:21,349
She can't have disappeared...

538
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:34,237
Do you hear...?

539
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:38,282
Cinderella!

540
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:51,003
Rosie, where have you been?

541
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:13,568
But this is the last one...

542
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:36,257
But this is... a wedding dress...

543
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,654
Well?

544
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:07,079
We should go back...
They'll be worried at the palace...

545
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:23,262
Your Highness, look!

546
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:29,560
That is she!

547
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:32,230
Go on, then...
Go on!

548
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:40,446
Have you brought my slipper?

549
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:47,078
I should return the ring
for the King of the Hunt...

550
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:50,873
But it belongs to you!

551
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,963
So now you know the answer
to my riddle?

552
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,842
Face smudged with ashes,
but it's no chimney-sweep?

553
01:20:03,302 --> 01:20:06,139
That day in the wood,
that bit of a girl!

554
01:20:07,348 --> 01:20:11,227
Hat with a feather
and cross-bow, but it's not hunstman?

555
01:20:12,019 --> 01:20:14,313
That little sharpshooter
was you, too!

556
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:20,111
Dress embroidered in silver,
but she's no Princess

557
01:20:20,194 --> 01:20:21,612
who is it?

558
01:20:22,655 --> 01:20:26,534
Our Cinderella!
Our Cinderella!

559
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:31,664
And mine, too...
If you want me?

560
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:41,132
And there'll be a wedding...

561
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:42,458
Your Highness,
history lesson is about to begin!
