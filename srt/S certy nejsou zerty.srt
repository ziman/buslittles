GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,240 
Once upon a time

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,080 
there was a kingdom

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,120 
and in it a mill

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,200 
wherein ruled Macha the miller,
a just and diligent man.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,360 
They had a fine son named Peter.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,360 
They'd have led a happy life

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,480 
had it not been for...

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,600 
...one kingdom thinking
the other better off...

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,120 
...and this being
why the first was worse off...

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,080 
whilst the third kingdom...

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,120 
Based on the story by
Screenplay, Dramaturge

14

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,000

English sub-titles by Doris Koziskova

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,440 
As if they'd all taken leave of their
senses.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000 
For ten years the small kingdoms were
at war.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,360 
Peter grew into an upright young man.
But his father was losing his strenght,

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080 
grieving for the good wife he had lost.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640 
Steward...

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,880 
You maintained war
would make our fortune.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,640 
Where is that fortune?

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,280 
To make it we'd have needed 5,000 ducats

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,280 
for an army - to win!

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,000 
Why did you make war then?

51
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,520 
I keep you,
to keep track of these things!

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600 
It's no fun ruling.

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,440 
I like hunting!

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,440 
After your wars there isn't a partridge
in my woods.

55
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,480 
If we set up an army.

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,120 
I'd need 5,000.

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,640 
You've gone mad.
Damn it, where are my...

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,680 
Keys?

59
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,640 
Keys!

60
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,760 
Good morning.
- Good morning.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200 
Don't you know
where my cash-box keys are?

62
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,720 
Adela!
- No, Pappa.

63
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,760 
Angelina?
- Oh, Pappa.

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,320 
Where can they be?

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,440 
Adela!

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,560 
But this is where you usually put them!
- Here!

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,840 
I never put it there.
- There?

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680 
Here!
- There!

69
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,560 
That's all...

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400 
AII? ...our cash.
- You promised me a new dress!

71
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,960 
The steward needs money a new army.
- 5,000.

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,320 
Adela never moans about new dresses.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,480 
Because I give her mine
and then have nothing to wear.

74
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280 
Let go,
this is State money.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,800 
Don't cry, Angelina,

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,040 
this dress is good enough for me.
- Shut up, you goose.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,880 
I'll never get married this way.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,600 
Must I do it all myself, you lazybones?

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,720 
You're such a help, my boy.

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,000 
Ah, the steward...

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,480 
Go watch your pots.
- We are honoured.

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,240 
Have you thought of getting married,
Dorothy?

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,080 
The man in my heart

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,960 
would hardly choose me.

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,960 
How about Machal the miller?

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,000 
Machal?

87
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360 
That old geezer?

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,800 
I thought you were more cunning.
If a bright young woman married him

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720 
the mill could soon hers.

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800 
But he's got a son.

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,040 
That can be arranged.

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,320 
Where did that cat come from?

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,280 
In the kitchen?

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160 
Good morning, neighbour!

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,320 
Good morning.

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,840 
Dear God, what a mess!
I was passing by,

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480 
something's burning,
would you like some help?

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,440 
Thank you.

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,160 
This is a woman's job.

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,520 
There, aren't they lovely.

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,640 
Help yourselves!
There's lots!

102
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,400 
In a matter of weeks -
they were married.

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,960 
If an old man wants to play the fool,

104
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,840 
he marries a young woman.

105
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,360 
For this we'll buy the field by the
pond.

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120 
The mill's enough, Dorothy,
a field would mean more work still!

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,320 
But Frankie, you're so strong!

108
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,000 
Surely you don't feel old?

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,320 
Of course not.

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,880 
Mind you don't burn it.

111
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,600 
Haven't you got a good wife?

112
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,840 
I have.

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,480 
Others would spend it all on clothes.

114
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,680 
Why did you let the men go?

115
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,840 
Whoever heard of two men doing all
the work?

116
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,040 
You do nothing but lazy around.
We have no money to waste!

117
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,400 
Dad, say something!

118
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,520 
Dorothy is right, Peter.
We'll manage.

119
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,720 
Frankie!
There's a dance on tonight.

120
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,680 
You haven't forgotten, have you?

121
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,920 
But Dorothy, I'm...
- Or do I go by myself?

122
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,840 
No, Dorothy, no.

123
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,920 
And now a gavotte!

124
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800 
Let's sit his out.

125
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200 
D'you want me to dance
with someone else?

126
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160 
No.
- Well then!

127
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,720 
Faster!

128
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,280 
Frankie!

129
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,120 
Poor unhappy me.
What'll I do without him?!

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360 
Once upon a time there was Hell.

131
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,600 
There they had a pair of scales,
not to weigh people's pounds

132
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,240 
but their sins.

133
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,280 
There was no cheating it.

134
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,160 
Stop!

135
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240 
Stand still and give me a report!

136
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,960 
Your Majesty, King of the Darkness,
Lucifer XIV.

137
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440 
I bear fresh news of Dorothy Machal.

138
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,120 
Wait!

139
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,800 
Where is the Book of Sins?
- It should have been here!

140
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,440 
Her cup of sins has overflowed.

141
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,480 
Here's the Book.
- Scram!

142
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,360 
Come here!

143
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,680 
You left your post?!

144
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,680 
The Bat has taken over!
- Quiet!

145
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,800 
I thought...
- Silence!

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000 
Scram!

147
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,480 
Dorothy Machal, page 1027,

148
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,960 
line eight.
- I can see.

149
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,440 
Line eight...

150
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,800 
So I see.
I look - and see!

151
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,000 
Yes, here.

152
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,080 
You impertinent devil.

153
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,640 
What do I see?

154
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000 
What do we see?

155
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480 
Stand still!
Don't move!

156
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240 
I said don't move!

157
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,200 
That's my boot.

158
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,800 
That was your boot.

159
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,800 
A feather.
Where did it come from?

160
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,520 
Come here, Cat!

161
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,320 
Here, come on!

162
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,640 
Let's see your teeth!

163
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,080 
Teeth!

164
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680 
Your hands!

165
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,560 
The other one!

166
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,400 
It hurts!

167
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,440 
All devils - line up!

168
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320 
No!

169
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,520 
Come here!

170
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,480 
A chicken!
All change back!

171
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,840 
Your hand!
What is that?!

172
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,520 
What is that?!

173
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600 
I was so terribly hungry!

174
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,000 
I'll show you, wanting meat.

175
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,840 
I hereby degrade you to rabbit!

176
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,640 
That was one single feather!

177
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,840 
Were it not for my intervention...

178
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,520 
the Book of Sins'd have been destroyed!

179
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,200 
So was my advice good, Dorothy?

180
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,640 
Very good.
Do help yourself,

181
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600 
we're not stingy like at the castle.

182
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,040 
Yes.
How pretty you are today, Dorothy.

183
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,360 
A young one.

184
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760 
Tender?

185
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,520 
I hurried over
to tell you -

186
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,920 
how sorry I am.

187
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200 
You didn't even know my father.

188
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,920 
Go and mend the roof, it's leaking.

189
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,440 
Did you hear me?

190
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,400 
The lazy lout.

191
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,800 
Get down at once!
Take that of the chimney!

192
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,120 
I am mending the roof

193
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200 
as you told me to.

194
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,680 
Did you hear me?

195
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880 
Climb down at once,
you young rascal!

196
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,120 
At once!

197
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,240 
You're right.

198
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,560 
I'm going.

199
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,400 
No.

200
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,520 
You dropped something.

201
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,640 
Help me, woman.
What is this?

202
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,080 
It smells horrid.

203
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,320 
Where're you going?
You haven't chopped the wood yet!

204
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160 
Let the steward chop it for you!

205
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,120 
I'll be back when you're gone!

206
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,680 
This will cost you dear!

207
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,840 
You lot her cheat you out of everything?

208
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,720 
Where's your common sense?

209
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,960 
I didn't leave everything.
Look!

210
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,280 
My mother's.
The ring I'll give my bride one day.

211
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,200 
Peek-a-boo!
I've got the warrant for arrest

212
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,200 
for that stepson of yours.

213
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,080 
When his Majesty signs it

214
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,880 
the mill will soon be ours.
I mean yours.

215
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,960 
A life sentence.
- A life sentence.

216
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,960 
Good!
- Isn't it?

217
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,840 
But it'll cost something.

218
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,080 
No, no.

219
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,040 
There was no need for that.
Put you'll need some for his Majesty,

220
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,680 
He's so money-minded.

221
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240 
Angeline!

222
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,440 
Come on!

223
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,880 
Wait!

224
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920 
Wait for me!

225
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,920 
Caught you!

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,720 
Look what you've done!
Torn my only dress!

227
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,520 
I'm sorry, Angelina.
Forgive me.

228
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,800 
Come on!
- We can darn it!

229
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,760 
No we can't.

230
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,640 
I am willing to ignore

231
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960 
that he wanted to kill me,

232
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,320 
but he robbed his mother,
that sadly berieved widow,

233
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,200 
and he up and left her

234
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,840 
with the whole mill to look after!

235
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,760 
What do I do?
I didn't bring up her son!

236
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,200 
No, your Majesty!

237
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,800 
You could jail him.

238
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,560 
He is an incredibly dangerous man.

239
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,440 
Look, come back some other time.

240
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,240 
I'm busy right now.

241
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,920 
So he's a naughty boy?

242
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,800 
I'm a helpless woman,

243
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760 
I'm afraid of him!

244
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,960 
You're telling me,
children are a worry.

245
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,800 
Yes.

246
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280 
Here.

247
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,800 
Pappa, now you'll admit

248
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,560 
that I need a new dress!

249
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440 
Here.

250
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,160 
What has Petr Machal done,
that you want him jailed?

251
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,600 
Children...
- May I?

252
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,560 
There.

253
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,600 
Would your Majesty take up the pen

254
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,080 
and sign here, please.

255
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,560 
Sign up, Pappa!

256
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920 
After you've ascertained

257
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,160 
who's in the right!
- Oh, come on.

258
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,000 
Right indeed.

259
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,040 
Yes.

260
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,040 
Joseph the Handsome.

261
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,080 
I didn't hear you say good day.

262
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,160 
On his Majesty's decision
you are under arrest.

263
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,480 
No.

264
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,640 
Arrested?
Why?

265
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,560 
They'll explain at the castle.

266
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,960 
Come on!

267
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,560 
Go away!

268
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,800 
Come on up!

269
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,440 
You'll pay for this.

270
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,120 
My best to his Majesty.

271
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,200 
You must run.

272
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,000 
Why?
I haven't done anything.

273
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,040 
How can you rebel against the masters?
You must always stay in their good books

274
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,520 
if you want to live in contentment.

275
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,800 
I want to live in contentment, Grandma.
But here.

276
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,160 
What's this?
Open the door!

277
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,840 
Is there anything wrong?

278
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,920 
Search the place!
Quickly!

279
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,240 
Quick!

280
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,200 
Open everything up!

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,760 
Look properly!

282
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,640 
Search everything thoroughly!

283
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160 
He has to be here somewhere!

284
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,120 
He isn't here.
- He isn't?

285
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,040 
Take her to the castle!
She'll be jailed instead of Peter!

286
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920 
Let her go!

287
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720 
Give in, Machal!

288
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,480 
Catch him!

289
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,040 
Here!

290
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,720 
Catch!

291
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840 
Well, come on!
Come on, then!

292
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,480 
Watcher rolling about for?
Where is he?

293
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,880 
I'll catch him myself.

294
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,000 
Machal, halt!

295
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560 
Help!

296
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,800 
Help us!

297
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,160 
Bravo, young man!
You've saved us.

298
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,920 
Tell me,
where did you learn to ride so well?

299
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,480 
We could have been killed.

300
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,640 
Thank you.

301
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240 
Thank you.

302
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320 
Tie him up!

303
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160 
Quickly!

304
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,560 
Come on!
Let's go.

305
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,840 
Wait!
But he saved our lives!

306
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,400 
Sorry, here's the warrant.
Take him away.

307
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,480 
But that's unjust.
Angelina!

308
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,120 
We thank you, Peter!

309
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,080 
Don't mention it.
- Go!

310
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,640 
On the other hand it was he
who made our horses shy off!

311
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,640 
Bravo!
Bravissimo!

312
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,480 
And now draw up a deed

313
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,080 
that the whole mill is mine.

314
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640 
Dorothy Machal...
here.

315
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,400 
It is high time
to bring Dorothy Machal down to Hell.

316
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,440 
Who volunteers?

317
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,200 
The first were Horse and Goat.

318
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,680 
Make your choice!

319
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,720 
A map of the village
a description of Dorothy Machal.

320
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,920 
Watch out for feathers
and no alcohol!

321
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,360 
Peter!

322
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,320 
It's you.

323
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,520 
I've brought some food.

324
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600 
Thanks.

325
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,800 
Tomorrow they'll judge you.
Don't argue with father.

326
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,080 
He's not a bad man,

327
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,720 
but he doesn't like quarrelsome people.

328
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,120 
Will your sister be there?

329
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,520 
Angelina'll be there.

330
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080 
And what's your name?
- Adela.

331
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,360 
I'll have to go.

332
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,840 
Bye,
and thanks, Adela.

333
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,920 
Ripple softly,

334
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,760 
sweet breeze

335
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,920 
cool my hot brow

336
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,960 
and stop it aching.

337
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,440 
Cool my hot brow

338
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,520 
and stop it aching.

339
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,000 
Call him gently, my Peter

340
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,280 
tell him that we two are made
for each other.

341
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,960 
Tell him that we two are made
for each other.

342
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,440 
Is that you, Angelina?
I knew you'd come.

343
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,360 
Answer me, Angelina!

344
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080 
I only wanted to see you.

345
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,880 
It wouldn't kill you to go and see him.

346
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,840 
He thinks of nothing but you.
- Such a pauper, and in jail?!

347
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,640 
No good to me at all.

348
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,680 
They'll be judging him tomorrow.

349
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,840 
Do talk to father,
he heeds your words.

350
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,560 
Do you know this rock?

351
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640 
That's Devil's Rock.
- Let's climb up.

352
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,400 
One shouldn't play around with
such things.

353
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,560 
You're such a baby!

354
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,280 
Adela!

355
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,160 
Angelina!

356
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,160 
Catch me!

357
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,240 
Wait for me!

358
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,040 
Adela, come quickly!

359
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,640 
How dare you? You thief!

360
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,960 
Forgive me ladies, I'm so hungry

361
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040 
and when I saw this snack?

362
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,320 
That was our food for the whole day!

363
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,600 
I'll have you locked up!

364
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,840 
Thanks for the hospitality, ladies.

365
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,760 
Where did you get this?

366
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,160 
The ducats are real.

367
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,600 
He was very odd.

368
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,880 
I told you to keep away
from Devil's Rock.

369
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920 
I'll believe in devils when I see one!

370
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,760 
Away with you!

371
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,800 
Dash it, feathers!

372
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,480 
A lovely day today!

373
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560 
Help!

374
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,280 
What happened, Ma'am?

375
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,560 
Nothing.
Just a bang in the stove.

376
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,440 
You have a visitor.
- Who?

377
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,000 
I'm no visitor.
This is more my home than yours.

378
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,880 
What do you want?
- I came because of Peter.

379
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,520 
It's that steward, not me!

380
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,600 
I love Peter!

381
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,320 
But...
- I need him here.

382
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,040 
Tomorrow I'll go to the castle
and beg them to let him go.

383
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,440 
I'll go now.

384
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,960 
Would you watch my tarts

385
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,840 
so they don't burn?

386
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,160 
I'll be right back.

387
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320 
And that's that.
The old cow.

388
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,440 
Take those weights off.
You inefficient fools!

389
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,360 
Can someone explain
what this is about?

390
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,480 
I'd like to know too.
The deuce!

391
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,000 
It's not dropping?!

392
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,120 
Are you Mrs Machal?

393
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400 
That I am.

394
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,000 
Let's see!

395
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,600 
Where is it?
- Here.

396
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,880 
Are you Dorothy Machal?

397
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,640 
Oh no!

398
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,520 
I'm Anna Machal.
Peter's grandmother, not stepmother.

399
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,960 
Horse, come here!
Here!

400
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,560 
You are degraded from the rank of Horse!

401
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,760 
Come for your wolf's tail tomorrow.

402
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,560 
Scram!

403
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,400 
Take her down!

404
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,200 
What the devil do we do with her?

405
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960 
What now?

406
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560 
You brought me here,

407
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,040 
you can take me back again.

408
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,080 
Definitely not.
- No.

409
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,760 
Hell has its rules.

410
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,320 
Exactly.

411
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,120 
What Hell has claimed its own

412
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,120 
must not Earth bemoan!

413
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,200 
Unless Mrs Machal were willing
to work off Horse's mistake here.

414
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,280 
What choice do I have.
At least it's nice and warm here.

415
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,640 
He stole this jewel-box
from his poor stepmother

416
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,320 
and then fled.

417
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,280 
That's not true!
They are my things!

418
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,520 
My real mother gave them to me!

419
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,640 
They're my jewels, he stole them!

420
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,840 
Why would he have fled otherwise?

421
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,200 
After all my loving care!

422
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,600 
He is a rebel!
He wounded three soldiers,

423
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,920 
bruised two...

424
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,960 
and made a fool of one.

425
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,560 
I didn't steal anything!
Ask my grandmother whose they are.

426
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,000 
Why is she not here?

427
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,640 
The devil carried her off!
I saw it with my own eyes.

428
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,440 
You see, what a family.

429
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,480 
Hell is never wrong,

430
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,480 
I suggest a life sentence.

431
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,880 
Life?

432
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,760 
Till the end of his life?

433
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,600 
Yes, your Majesty,
I suggest a life sentence.

434
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,040 
Angelina, say something.

435
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,400 
And confiscated property.
Justice is justice.

436
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,960 
I don't know what he's guilty of,
but he saved our lives

437
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,840 
when he stopped the runaway horses.

438
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,720 
When he fled from justice, you mean.

439
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,600 
Angelina'll tell you about it.

440
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,440 
Speak up, we're waiting.

441
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,600 
I don't know, Pappa.
I was too frightened.

442
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,320 
But Angelina!
I request that he...

443
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,600 
Stick him in the army, your Majesty!
For 10 years.

444
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,800 
No!
Hold him!

445
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760 
I'll tame him.

446
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,760 
Not long enough, for life!

447
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,960 
12 years, then.

448
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,520 
Your task is clear!
Bring Dorothy Machal

449
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,360 
or don't come back!

450
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,560 
Who volunteers?

451
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,480 
What?
How dare you after all that!

452
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,800 
Our object is making good use

453
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,920 
of your mistake!

454
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,400 
I thought...
- Silence!

455
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,320 
And no thinking!
I'll turn you into a worm!

456
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,920 
You too.
You need taking down a peg or two.

457
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,680 
We're the ones to do the thinking.

458
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,920 
Not you, scribe!

459
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,520 
No!

460
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,600 
Mr Lucifer, in your place
I'd send the one who botched it up.

461
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,240 
He'll try all the harder.

462
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,280 
I know this Johnny?

463
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,640 
Yeah, some Johnny?

464
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,120 
I've learnt a new trick.
Watch!

465
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,160 
Only the Prince of Hell
may change his likeness!

466
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,440 
Correct.

467
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,160 
Naturally.
But costumes may be changed.

468
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,120 
How hard Johnny's trying!

469
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,240 
And he knows the place now,
he won't make another mistake.

470
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,520 
Attention!

471
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,640 
What for?

472
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,880 
I'll show you what for!

473
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,440 
Put that log down!

474
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,640 
Call these buttons sewn on?

475
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,480 
This one.

476
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800 
Stack' em up!

477
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,040 
It's come down!
Stack' em up!

478
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,640 
Halt!

479
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,000 
Start building it up!

480
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,040 
Come in!

481
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,960 
How could I have lived without all this.

482
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,400 
Shut your eyes, Dorothy.

483
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,200 
Now?

484
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,600 
He looked like...
- The devil.

485
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,000 
Yes.

486
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,440 
And he's scared of feathers!

487
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,000 
Not for me, thanks.

488
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,040 
This Finicky-Nick doesn't like our beer!

489
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,560 
You don't like our beer?

490
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,160 
It's good.

491
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,440 
Say it's good didn't taste it.

492
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,800 
Tasting means drinking, my boy!

493
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,760 
All of it?
- AII!

494
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,320 
And bring him another!

495
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,680 
I bet we'll recruit 10 today!

496
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,840 
Two bottles!
No, three!

497
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,960 
Last time the wager was for four.

498
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,760 
That was last time.

499
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,200 
It's come down again.
Must be the wind.

500
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,400 
Stack' em up!

501
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,960 
And move it!

502
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,480 
Come on, men.

503
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,720 
Ah, for our lovely pub
ah, for their lovely grub,

504
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,800 
the soup is so hot

505
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,120 
the boor is with froth!

506
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,040 
Pour out for the boys toe.

507
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,400 
Here you are, boys.

508
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,960 
Bring it here.

509
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,080 
Sign it here.

510
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,520 
Here.

511
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,720 
There'll be not work in the army?

512
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,360 
There's never work!

513
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,880 
Nothing but parades and reviews-
and money!

514
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,440 
I can't write.

515
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,600 
Never mind, your thumb.

516
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,240 
A great idea!

517
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,640 
What's this?
Who put it here?

518
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,920 
Who did it?
Whose stupid joke was it?

519
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,080 
The deuce!
Get up!

520
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,560 
Surprise!
Didn't expect me?

521
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,520 
What are you wearing, you fool?
Out!

522
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,600 
I thought...
- Don't think, shut up!

523
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,920 
Where's your tail?

524
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,040 
In my suit.
- In what suit?

525
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,320 
The soldiers burnt it all!

526
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,640 
By Satan, you let them burn your tail
and sign you up for the army!

527
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,840 
From now on you're

528
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,080 
an ordinary mortal!
Hell is shut for you forever!

529
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,840 
Mercy!
Prince of Darkness,

530
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,680 
I'll do anything to set it right!

531
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,120 
Mercy!

532
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,920 
I promise never to drink again!

533
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,120 
Let me go!

534
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,840 
I'm no soldier, I'm a devil!

535
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,160 
I've come for a widow?!

536
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,440 
A widow? A devil?

537
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,400 
You wait!

538
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,440 
Arms up!
One, two, three, four!

539
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,600 
Arms down!
One, two, three, four!

540
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,600 
Forward march!
One, two, three, four!

541
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,520 
Halt!

542
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,240 
Call that marching?
Your name and rank!

543
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,560 
Devil of Horse rank, no Wolf.

544
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,320 
What?
You dare make fun of me?

545
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,960 
Down - up!

546
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,160 
Down!

547
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,120 
Up!
Down!

548
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,200 
Up!
Down!

549
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,680 
Come in to the garden.

550
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,560 
Wait.

551
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,000 
Down!
Up!

552
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160 
Down!
Up!

553
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,440 
Arms at the ready!

554
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,480 
That's rebellion!
Throw your weapon down!

555
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,880 
What's that?

556
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,640 
Machal, back in line!
What did I say?

557
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,760 
Get back, Machal!

558
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,320 
20 days' jail
and 50 lashings!

559
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,400 
Come back!

560
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,040 
Did you see that?

561
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,720 
Peter must have a good heart.

562
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,960 
You and your Peter.

563
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,080 
Mine?

564
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,800 
You know he wants you.
And you?

565
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,040 
Exactly.
Men need tricking, you silly.

566
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,880 
50 lashings.

567
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,240 
They shout at you all day
make you roll in the mud.

568
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,840 
And all because of that woman.

569
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,240 
Surely you're not in love?

570
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,080 
No fear.

571
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,600 
I was to bring a bad widow to Hell.

572
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,160 
Was it Dorothy Machal by any chance?

573
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,720 
How do you know?

574
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,280 
If anybody I know deserves hell,

575
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,600 
it's my stepmother.

576
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,160 
So you are Peter?

577
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,240 
And you really are a devil.

578
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,240 
I should say!

579
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,440 
Oh, but I'm not any more.
I'd have to get my wolf's tail back.

580
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,320 
A wolf's tail?

581
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,400 
I can't go back to hell till I have it.

582
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,400 
What do you mean, a wolf's tail?

583
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,360 
I can't change back without it.

584
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,480 
I don't get it.

585
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,480 
Go clean out the stables.

586
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,440 
Doesn't Princess Angelina

587
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,400 
look lovely?

588
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,360 
Our cash-box is empty,
the ceiling's coming down

589
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,880 
and we hold balls for borrowed money.

590
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,200 
Curtsy, Angelina!

591
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,480 
To the green one.

592
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,680 
It's all arranged.

593
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,680 
Angelina, Curtsy.

594
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,120 
Angelina will marry richest suitor,

595
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,800 
we'll pay our debts and have some over.

596
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,120 
Do you like any of them?

597
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,520 
Whom do you like?

598
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,520 
Who is the richest?

599
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,280 
She says who is the richest?

600
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,880 
Well, who is the richest?
- Who is??

601
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,920 
Quietly.
I'll find out.

602
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,280 
Can it be a dead wolf's tail?

603
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,320 
Sure,
how'd you out it off a live one?

604
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,440 
I know of one.
But how to got out of the barracks.

605
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,640 
Wait!

606
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,720 
Ah, for our lovely pub
ah, for their lovely grub,

607
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,320 
the soup is so hot

608
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,080 
the boor is with froth!

609
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,640 
What's happening?

610
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,800 
What's should be?

611
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,520 
Nothing?
- Nothing.

612
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160 
Sure?
- Sure.

613
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,240 
I know now who's the richest.

614
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,040 
I've investigated.

615
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,800 
According to ancient custom
the Princess will throw a golden apple,

616
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,160 
the man it stops by will become
her husband.

617
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,240 
But that's not gold.

618
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,440 
No, I shall gold it.

619
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,160 
What if it rolls some Pauper?

620
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,400 
Yes.
The ball is actually made of iron.

621
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,120 
And this stone will make it stop

622
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,720 
by the richest of the suitors.

623
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,280 
Try pulling it away.

624
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,800 
I can't.

625
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,800 
I'll do it.

626
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,480 
What is this stone?

627
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,920 
It comes from Magnet Mountain

628
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,120 
and attracts all iron objects.

629
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,720 
I did say all iron objects.

630
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,920 
Yes, but...

631
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,440 
I'd prefer...

632
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,120 
The army is important,

633
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,360 
believe me.

634
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,760 
Hello, officer!
What are you doing here?

635
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,360 
How lovely you look, Princess.

636
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,960 
And gallant, too.

637
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,960 
But you haven't asked me dance yet!

638
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,840 
Permit me to rectify my mistake.

639
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,360 
For so long I've been wanting...
- Long?

640
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,680 
I don't know you, you must be new.

641
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,920 
Good evening, Peter.
- Good evening.

642
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,040 
That's Machal, the young miller.

643
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,200 
Where did you steal the uniform?
How dare you?

644
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,280 
Guards!

645
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,560 
Wait, Angelina!

646
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,000 
Guards!

647
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,360 
I only wanted to see you.

648
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,920 
Catch him!

649
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,680 
Hurry up!
Throw him in prison!

650
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,600 
Peter!
Hide in here!

651
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,120 
He ran this way!

652
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,760 
Come on!

653
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,440 
Thank you, Princess.
- Run!

654
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,440 
Prince, do you want our Princess?

655
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,080 
I'd give anything...

656
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,120 
Put this in your shoe and she is yours.

657
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,560 
According to ancient custom
the Princess's husband

658
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,520 
will be chosen...
justly... by this golden apple.

659
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,640 
He to whom it rolls will have her.

660
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,440 
As his wife!

661
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,640 
As his wife.

662
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,880 
The apple.
Roll it towards the left.

663
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,040 
No!

664
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,760 
Help!

665
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,760 
Pappa!

666
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,040 
I'll tell my Pappa and
he'll declare war!

667
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,600 
Congratulations, you won.

668
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,080 
My Pappa will make war on you.
Carry him away.

669
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,120 
Pappa'll make war!

670
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,960 
Take this thing out of my shoe!

671
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,680 
What thing?

672
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,440 
We've been cheated!

673
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,240 
Take my shoe off!

674
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,240 
We want the money we lent you!

675
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,360 
We've been tricked!
- Silence!

676
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,440 
We'll declare war together!

677
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,960 
Take my shoe off!
My Pappa'll make war on you!

678
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,920 
Sure.

679
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,320 
What will we do?

680
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,120 
Luckily we have a strong army.

681
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,840 
There's a parade tomorrow.

682
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,720 
What?
- A parade.

683
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,840 
We have a parade?

684
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,640 
Come and see.
- I'll come.

685
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,680 
Action stations!

686
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,160 
Dammit-all-to-hell
I said action stations!

687
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,160 
Sound the alarm!

688
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,760 
Attention!
Where is your uniform, you stupid?

689
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,120 
Attention!

690
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,040 
Attention!
Attention!

691
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,040 
This way.

692
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,680 
Excuse me, where's the door.

693
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,600 
Fire!

694
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,840 
Come!

695
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,160 
My dress!

696
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,000 
Corporal!
Is this what you call a strong army?

697
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,040 
Catch him!

698
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,000 
Bring my horse!

699
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,640 
Backwards again!

700
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,080 
What?
- Turn me round!

701
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,320 
Turn the horse round!
- Not the horse, me!

702
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,840 
Wait.

703
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,600 
Now.

704
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,560 
Dorothy!
Dorothy!

705
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,160 
Let me go!

706
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,160 
Leave me alone!
Help!

707
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,520 
Help!
No!

708
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,880 
Follow them!
Encircle them!

709
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,200 
Quickly!

710
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,720 
Everybody here!

711
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600 
Help!

712
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,320 
Peter!

713
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,600 
Give it to me.

714
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,640 
Come on, Peter!

715
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,600 
Follow them quickly!

716
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,000 
We must get them!

717
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,080 
How's that?

718
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,920 
This doesn't load anywhere.
Dammit-all-to-hell!

719
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,800 
You're ready for the gallows, Machal!

720
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,640 
Hell's bells and cocker shells!

721
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,840 
The gallows for you!

722
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,320 
I snapped my sword!

723
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,840 
My dear boy!

724
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,120 
How happy I am to see you.

725
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,080 
Good, she's sinking!

726
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,680 
She's ours!

727
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,720 
Take her!

728
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,960 
She broke our scales.

729
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,720 
Come here.

730
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,680 
What do we do with him?

731
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,960 
Leave me here for a few days.
They want to hang me.

732
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,080 
Let go!

733
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,280 
Take your hands away you hairy monster!

734
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,520 
Help!

735
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,800 
Let me go!

736
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,480 
Don't touch me!

737
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,720 
No,
help!

738
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,240 
Help!
Help!

739
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,040 
This is an ultimatum!
The ceiling's coming down.

740
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,560 
Either I return their money within
the month

741
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,320 
or they'll declare war.

742
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,360 
Signed - all nine kingdoms.

743
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,440 
Where am I to find the money?

744
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,840 
How about selling the castle?

745
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,400 
Are you mad?
Sell the roof over my head?

746
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,000 
Actually, who'd buy the old ruin.

747
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,520 
This castle was built
in the 12th century by my ancestors,

748
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,200 
Ferdinand the Handsome and Josephine
the Mad.

749
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,280 
Maybe I'd buy it off you,

750
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,240 
to do you a favour.

751
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,600 
The water strokes the pebbles

752
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,320 
tenderly and softly
that is love.

753
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,080 
Tenderly and softly
that is love.

754
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,880 
Peter, dearest Peter,

755
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,200 
who'll tell you that we two

756
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,560 
are made for each other.

757
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,960 
Get up!

758
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,800 
The Devil never sleeps!

759
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,800 
He did all this in a few days.

760
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,680 
Leave that be and come here!

761
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,520 
What do you think you're doing?
All this work down here?!

762
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,920 
You'll spoil our reputation!

763
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,520 
Make three wishes
and back to Earth with you!

764
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,360 
One wish -
take me back home.

765
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,560 
Of course, I will.
But what else?

766
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,040 
Wait a minute.

767
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,840 
Ask for this.

768
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,520 
Such a scruffy old coat?
- It's magic.

769
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,240 
He who wears it finds a ducat

770
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,440 
in his pocket every time.

771
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,760 
What is your wish?

772
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,880 
To go back to Earth

773
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,720 
to fetch the Corporal!

774
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,040 
I'm coming with you.

775
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,480 
All right.
You may take the coat.

776
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,280 
And your grandmother.

777
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:41,040 
I'll let Johnny go under the condition

778
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,840 
that he brings the Corporal and
the Steward.

779
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,200 
All right.
But won't they hang me?

780
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,880 
With that coat on you are protected.

781
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,040 
Put it on!

782
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,320 
But don't forget -

783
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,880 
when you take it off you lose all
powers.

784
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,280 
May we go?

785
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,320 
Let's see you.
Yes, you may!

786
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,080 
Whom do we fetch first,
the Steward or the Corporal?

787
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,680 
I'm going home to bake some cakes.

788
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,960 
We're going to the pub.

789
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,600 
Not even Lucifer
will get me to the pub.

790
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,560 
That's where all my troubles began!

791
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,480 
So I'll make the sacrifice and go.

792
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,440 
You keep watch outside.
- You're great.

793
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,400 
The devil!
The devil!

794
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,360 
The devil!

795
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,440 
How did they recognize you?
Me? Look at yourself!

796
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,920 
Potato soup.

797
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,640 
A full plate, please!

798
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,080 
Pork with sauerkraut.
- Yes, Sir.

799
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,160 
Goulash.

800
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,160 
With bread.

801
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,600 
And cream-cheese dumplings.

802
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,120 
Right,
but can you pay?

803
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,440 
Your servant, Milord -
at first sight I thought...

804
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,840 
that you're...

805
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,600 
What?

806
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,960 
The devil!

807
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,080 
Oh no.

808
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,720 
I'm no devil.
I only look that way.

809
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,920 
Take a seat,
it won't be long.

810
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,000 
Take them.
They're yours.

811
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,840 
Lots of money you say?

812
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,280 
Must be a foreigner.

813
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,120 
He's throwing ducats around.

814
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,120 
Ducats?

815
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,640 
He hands out as many as they ask for.

816
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,040 
But Angelina.
- He must be mad.

817
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,080 
See?
- Dress up as a pauper and go!

818
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,880 
We can't miss such a chance!

819
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,320 
82
- 82, thank you.

820
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,080 
83
- 83, thank you.

821
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,040 
84
- 84, thank you.

822
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,800 
Come in!

823
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,120 
Excuse me.

824
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,520 
That's the Steward, you know!

825
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,720 
I know.
I'll knock his feathered hat off.

826
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,920 
And I'll catch him.

827
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,040 
Where were we?
- 80

828
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,640 
81
- 81

829
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,480 
82
- 82

830
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,840 
83
- 83

831
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,200 
84

832
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,720 
How dare you?

833
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,640 
See this feather?
I have two, just in case!

834
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,840 
Noble foreigner, you won't believe me

835
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,040 
but I'm the poorest man around.

836
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,280 
They all cheat me,
my children, the steward...

837
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,880 
All I have but debts.

838
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,760 
What would you like, your Majesty?

839
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,680 
How can you know I'm...

840
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,760 
Let's not play hide and seek.

841
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,320 
How much do you need?

842
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,000 
20,000 ducats.

843
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,920 
All right,

844
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,080 
but if you give me your daughter in
marriage.

845
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,400 
30.000

846
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,200 
I know it's a lot.

847
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,280 
I don't understand.

848
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,480 
I'm not scared, but I need help.

849
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,080 
Help?

850
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,400 
I have the feeling the devil
is after me.

851
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,560 
The devil...

852
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,560 
The devil.

853
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,720 
I'll think of something.

854
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,680 
Don't bother,

855
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,080 
I've done that myself.

856
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,520 
But I need a certain bunch of keys.

857
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,040 
Keys?

858
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,360 
I know the whereabouts of the steward
and corporal.

859
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,760 
I heard them make arrangements.

860
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,480 
But they've still got the feather.

861
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,440 
Never mind.

862
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,720 
Is the look dependable?

863
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,160 
Sure,
it can be unlocked only from outside

864
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,560 
and there stand the guards.
We are absolutely safe.

865
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,880 
Come on, you...

866
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,520 
Come here.

867
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,600 
Come, little orphan,
join the others.

868
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,120 
Here I am.
High time, too.

869
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,240 
Corporal!

870
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,200 
Quickly.

871
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,040 
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

872
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,640 
Which way?

873
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,680 
What a lot of money!

874
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,280 
I'll have some.

875
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,480 
Help!

876
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,280 
Where are they?

877
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,520 
Soldiers, attention!

878
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,960 
There they are!

879
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,360 
Not there, this way.

880
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,760 
The secret passage to the castle!

881
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,800 
I'll help you.

882
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,640 
This way?
Run!

883
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,520 
Climb out!

884
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,320 
No feathers.
- On our hats!

885
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,560 
Back to the chest!

886
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,680 
Quickly!
- This way!

887
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,400 
I want to...

888
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,840 
Wait here...

889
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,560 
But Pappa...
- Who are you?

890
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,640 
What are you doing here?

891
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,640 
Come on!

892
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,400 
Here we're safe.

893
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,960 
And now we can disappear.

894
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,120 
We're wasted in this stupid kingdom.

895
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,320 
Thank you, Peter!

896
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,000 
You'll have to marry him,
or he won't give us the money!

897
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,480 
When he spruces up a bit...

898
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,160 
I'm doing no such thing.
The Princess must marry me as I am.

899
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,040 
I'll never marry such an eyesore!

900
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,840 
Never!

901
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,480 
Our debts!
Don't offend him.

902
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,960 
I couldn't stand people seeing me
with such a fright!

903
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,800 
As you like.
Goodbye.

904
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,840 
Please, dear children!

905
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,120 
There'd be war!

906
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400 
Get her to marry him, Pappa!

907
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,840 
I'll keep my word.

908
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,040 
My daughter will marry you.

909
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,360 
She will sacrifice herself
for the Kingdom, for the family.

910
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,240 
Au revoir.

911
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,800 
Wait!

912
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880 
Poor little girl.

913
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,240 
She'll get used to him.

914
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,200 
One for us,
one for his Majesty.

915
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,120 
One for us,
one for his Majesty.

916
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,640 
Pull out another, Peter.

917
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,200 
You'll need to renovate the mill.

918
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,480 
One for us,
and one for us too.

919
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,920 
And one each for luck.

920
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,200 
Tomorrow we go to the castle.

921
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,640 
I'm getting married.

922
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,480 
Why are you doing that?

923
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,920 
Thank you, Lucifer!

924
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,920 
Who is it?
- Wait.

925
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,840 
Yes, they're real.

926
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,960 
I have come for my bride.

927
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,680 
I'm marrying this one!

928
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,800 
When I asked for your daughter,
I meant Adela.

929
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,000 
This one?!

930
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,600 
She's the one I'll marry.

931
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,680 
Dear children.
I'll stay on the shelf?!

932
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,400 
I'll think of something.

933
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,360 
I want a husband now!

934
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,400 
It's not fair!

935
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,040 
Angelina, please?
- Excuse me.

936
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,040 
May I have the pleasure?

937
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,240 
With your permission.

938
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,560 
Yes.

939
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:17,120 
Angelina, a partner for you.

940
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,720 
Interesting, passionate.

941
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,760 
A good thing you didn't marry
that miller.

942
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,320 
How about marrying a Prince?

943
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,760 
Even the Prince of Hell?

944
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,000 
Of course.
I don't believe in hell, you see.

945
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,680 
In that case...

946
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,800 
Lots of happiness.

947
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,520 
Johnny!

948
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,320 
Johnny!

949
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,440 
But that's...
- She'll be fine.

950
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,360 
Johnny!

951
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,720 
I've got to go.

952
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,560 
But...

953
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,520 
Johnny!

954
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,400 
Peter!

955
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,440 
Hell may exist or not,
but it was a good idea.

956
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,560 
If we look around us we see

957
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,240 
that many people would be in need of it.

958
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,840 
It isn't a good thing for people
to think

959
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,600 
that evil can go unpunished.

960
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,320 
I'm your love,

961
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,320 
you are my love, too.

962
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,080 
Why should we stay...

963
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,160 
...why should we stay alone.

964
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,160 
THE END
