Hi.
- Ciao!

15
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,155
Good morning.
- Good morning... Hi... Good morning

16
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,436
Where're you off to, Blazenka?

17
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,510
I want to show the girls...

18
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,875
Do show us too!

19
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,877
My wedding invitations,
my Mum said to deliver them.

20
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,958
Mm... Mm...
- That's up-side-down.

21
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,310
Mm, Mm. Yea, yea...

22
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,358
I can't see a thing,
I sat on my glasses.

23
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,350
When is it to be?
- Soon, the Saturday after next.

24
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,752
Sure,
it's knocking on your belly-button!

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,958
Great fun, this.

26
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,673
Hello!
- Ciao.

27
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,757
May I?

28
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,992
Thanks.
All the best.

29
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,757
Thanks.

30
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,273
They smiled at each other,

31
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,755
did you see?
- But if looks could kill...

32
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,675
Good morning.
- Good morning.

33
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,836
You got one too?

34
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,427
Very nice, all gold.

35
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,273
Pity I can't see.

36
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,675
How much did it cost?

37
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,916
I wouldn't know.
No shot-gun wedding for me.

38
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
No, but she had two abortions,

39
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,151
the slut.

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,836
Don't stare at me!

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,877
Now then be good, Mum!

42
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,274
Don't keep making me mad!

43
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,470
For how long will I be held up here
like this?

44
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,353
Come on up at once!
- No!

45
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,913
The Doctor'll get angry.
- No. It does not matter...

46
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,555
Just let him get angry!
He'll go away and that's that!

47
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,836
Let him go, so what.

48
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,153
No one asked him.

49
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,834
He can take his own filthy medicine.
- Just try to pour it away...!

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,958
They'd do me in,

51
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,834
with such poisons!

52
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,716
Such horrible stuff!

53
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,029
She has poured it out... Of course!

54
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,038
This filthy, disgusting staff! My God...

55
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,278
You dare try that on me!

56
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,470
And you too with the filth!

57
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,557
The bastards all guzzle beer

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,958
and make me drink this!

59
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,630
I know why you go mad like this!

60
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,630
I bet the kids've brought you beer

61
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,755
and you're drunk!

62
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,677
Drunk - from what?
You don't give me food or drink -

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,755
more often than not.

64
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,836
Shame on you, Mum,

65
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,958
saying we don't feed you!
- It's true!

66
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,430
Don't pretend,

67
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,875
I'm an old woman

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,550
you need to get rid of me,
so you feed me on filth!

69
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,439
Come on, just,
just keep your mouth shut, mummy.

70
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,555
We give you the choice bits,

71
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,596
how can you say such things?!

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,829
Well, but it is true!
Like the soup today,

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,877
disgusting, gone off it was.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,911
It was sour-cream soup!

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,115
It was supposed to be sour!

76
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,350
Say
what you want next time!

77
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,511
It was horrible muck.

78
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,915
But you ate it all!

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,958
Can you hear this, doctor?
- You never give me schnitzel!

80
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,838
You've got no teeth to chew it with!

81
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,519
I haven't, I haven't... Well, I have.

82
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,273
My teeth are in the side-board drawer.

83
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,867
They've been there for 15 years!

84
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,274
So how would you chew?

85
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,278
Make some goulash, then.

86
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,358
You know it gives you diarrhoea!

87
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,836
She always shits her bed afterwards.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,911
Please stop it! Not in front of this.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,911
I know what's behind it...
- And what?

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,958
Your old man's the same.

91
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,834
Meaning what?

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,274
I know he isn't worth a shit
but he's my husband!

93
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,674
A drunkard, and so are you!

94
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,836
How dare you, me and drunk?
- Yea, yea, yea!

95
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,875
You're the one who gets tipsy.
- You too.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,910
Shame on you,

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,910
in front of the Doctor.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,594
Dear God, I don't deserve

99
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,279
such a daughter!

100
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,357
You've got what you made
so don't complain!

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,839
Swallow this and shut up!

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,956
Why fight, I always win.

103
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,357
Just you dare spit it out!

104
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,278
She does it all the time.

105
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,072
I'm more of an animal-tamer
than loving daughter!

106
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,839
All this screaming,
the neighbours'll think

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,956
we beat you!

108
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,274
They want to get rid of me...

109
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,960
I'd rather go to the old peoples home
than this here.

110
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,668
What do I have here? Real purgatory.
- Well, granny...

111
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,360
Now then, today I'll give you

112
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,830
a better-tasting medicine!

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,433
You'll be up on the wedding-day!

114
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,352
You and your shitty medicines!

115
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,273
I told you not to talk that way

116
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,278
and damm it all
you keep swearing!

117
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,676
Why don't you feel ashamed?!
So old you could

118
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,711
to know better.
- I will not.

119
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,472
We do our best for you!

120
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,875
And what do you do?

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,274
If I did not tidy your scarf up
you'd disappear in there!

122
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,355
She has finished her rampage.
I'll have peace for minute.

123
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,549
The wedding-cakes,
Blaza's made some already, Doctor.

124
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,835
Come along.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,957
We're so busy and this...

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,274
Good morning.
- Good morning.

127
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:12,278
Here's the wedding-invitation,

128
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,913
all gold,
isn't it lovely?!

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,070
It cost a mint!

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,269
Is that supposed to be a "K"?!

131
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,674
Leave me alone!

132
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,438
That's a fine "K",
if you saw mine...

133
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,510
You're educated, Doctor,

134
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,279
the chemist can read your handwriting,
but this?

135
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,357
He can't even write the addresses!

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,158
Christ, Bavorov with a small "b"!

137
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,073
Put it down, you idiot.

138
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,235
All you're good at is guzzling beer!

139
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,311
Where's the beautiful bride?

140
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,357
She's delivering the invitations.

141
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,273
This is the real stuff, from Moravia.

142
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,357
Well, doctor...
But Mrs Skopkova, I don't drink.

143
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,830
This isn't drink, Doctor.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,956
This is medicine!

145
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,155
Just sniff!

146
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,278
You must drink Blazenka's health!

147
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,273
You've had enough.
Here.

148
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,357
Don't hesitate,

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,669
drink up!

150
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,916
Well then to Blazenka.

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,957
And bottoms up!

152
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,557
Ouch, it burns!
Now down the other leg!

153
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,318
Pity she's out,

154
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,715
I brought her something.

155
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,870
How beautiful!

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,957
What a waste,
the garden's full of flowers!

157
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,357
An orchid, look!

158
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,035
Blazena doesn't deserve it.

159
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,155
Do not say that, Mrs. Skopkova.

160
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,470
If I found such a girl,
I'd cherish her!

161
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,557
I know.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,957
Where're you off to now?

163
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,677
I'm working like an idiot,
- And why?

164
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,758
Everyone's down by the river...

165
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,475
It won't...
- Hurry up!

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,067
It won't kill you.

167
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,350
Let's go.
- Well.

168
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,273
It won't kill you.

169
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,357
Venca!

170
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,278
What's up?!

171
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,470
The invitations!

172
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,908
Come and look at them!

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,957
Okay.
At ease, Joseph.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,467
Great, aren't they?
- Mmmm.

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,510
Such pretty turtle-doves!

176
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,476
They give me ideas.

177
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,758
Stop it, Joseph's here.

178
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,475
He'll turn round.

179
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,557
Stop it!

180
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,758
Look, he's watching!

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,957
All right then...

182
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,758
Holy Elijah!
Crikey!

183
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,758
Away, impure thoughts.

184
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,758
Christ, what is it?

185
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,357
Apage, can you hear me?

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,957
Help!

187
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,269
Sodom and Gomorrah.

188
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,357
Christ's foot forwards!

189
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,957
Let him leave me! Let him leave me!

190
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,158
But I suppose
they may, now.

191
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,758
Let's go home.

192
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,357
Mother of God...

193
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,557
Dear old man, are you hurt?

194
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,158
An angel. A real angel!

195
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,758
Look where you're going, old fool!

196
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,467
Look, it's scratched.

197
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,352
Fuck it all!

198
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,437
Don't ride bikes if you're clumsy!

199
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,839
Be glad I didn't flatten you out!

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,957
So - are you okay?

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,035
Okay.

202
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,158
Let me help you.

203
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,832
That's all right, just mud.

204
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,957
Take it easy!

205
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,839
Very much.

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,957
I'll show you!

207
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,357
Let's go, girls!

208
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,910
I'll drive you to the village.

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,832
It's only a few steps.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,832
Come on, climb in.

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,957
Wait!
- Let's go!

212
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,357
My brolly.

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,957
Virgin Mary, see this?

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,957
Your brolly and let's go.

215
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,557
God will repay.
- Yeah.

216
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,758
And my basket.

217
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,758
My bicycle!

218
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,669
Well, isn't he crazy...

219
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,758
Wasn't that the priest?
- In whose car?

220
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,510
Okay.

221
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,272
Let's go girls.

222
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,278
What happened, Father?

223
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,359
You look a sight, Father!

224
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,670
Isn't it horrible?
- Who was it?

225
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,268
A face like an angel

226
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,357
words tender and gentle

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,833
as she dusted my cassock

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,958
with a fragrant hand.

229
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,557
Some nightmare.

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,275
Mrs. Teacher!

231
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,357
Hello!

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,275
What are you doing here?

233
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,310
I knocked down some old geezer,

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,310
his bike scratched my car.

235
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,278
And such a lovely car!

236
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,357
Our old sinner Otto the priest.
Is he agonner?

237
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,873
A couple of bruises.
I need some coffee

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,958
quick!
- Sure, come in.

239
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,875
Two small lemonades.

240
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,468
You bought some in the shop!

241
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,557
But these are yellow.

242
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,958
Who's that?

243
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,667
A woman engineer from Prague.

244
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,472
She's on her way to Vienna.

245
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,557
To Vienna?
Open one for me!

246
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,557
How does Miluna know her?

247
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,117
Turn the radio off,
I can't hear.

248
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,357
Her name's Wendy.

249
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,357
Isn't she the image of her Dad?

250
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,032
You've knocked the breath out of me.

251
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,157
He's nothing much.

252
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,157
But she's got your beauty.

253
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,958
You always were special.

254
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,958
Good old Strakonice days.

255
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,268
Hubby left me the car

256
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,357
and some money.
But that's it.

257
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,834
The hell of a work!

258
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,911
Where can I find him?

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,955
Somewhere round the farm.

260
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,109
But probably in the office now.

261
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,269
Good morning.
- Goodbye.

262
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,357
Bye.
- I'll be back.

263
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,157
Hi.
- Look what I've done.

264
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,433
Pretty, isn't it?
- Show me!

265
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,510
Well, look.

266
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,875
But there should be a poem.

267
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,275
Beda and me,

268
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,516
we'll have:

269
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,875
Go with him
who loves you.

270
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,911
That's nice.

271
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,115
D'you know
what the idiot told me?

272
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,269
That he'd be run off his feet!

273
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,357
Maybe there's something in it,
look.

274
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,958
Who's that?
- I don't know.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,958
Let me!

276
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,959
You wrote
that you'd parted!

277
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,150
That you'll take us home.

278
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,195
Bigmouth!

279
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,236
Yes, but...
- Well?

280
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,351
It didn't work out.
What?

281
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,395
She's so sensitive.

282
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,948
I see. Sensitive?
Whilst your child isn't.

283
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,349
You betrayed us once before.
- So I betrayed you?!

284
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,435
So I have betrayed? You say?

285
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,750
You married that rich old fart!

286
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,790
I wasn't good enough.

287
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,314
A mere farmer.

288
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,431
That's her, let's move!

289
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,670
This is stupid, here, like this...
- What taste you have now.

290
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,950
But I'd like to meet her.

291
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,036
You have got mad...

292
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,230
Hello, Miss Eva!
- Hello.

293
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,951
Good morning.

294
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,955
Give me a couple of days. - But
after than you will marry me, won't you?

295
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,996
Yes, I'll tell Eva myself.

296
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,752
With Evik... - Well,
and before you return from Vienna,

297
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,234
I will be free again, and so...
after that... - The poor girl.

298
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,430
On the 18th, then.
- Well, bye.

299
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,710
Do it by then

300
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,790
or else...

301
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,950
This village'll never have seen such

302
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,752
a scene!

303
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,678
'Bye.

304
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,150
That is a loss.

305
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,153
That's a face well slapped.

306
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,960
Again.
Who was she?

307
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,150
Don't go mad!

308
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,198
Confess!

309
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,557
Gaby.
I mean Mrs Feyfar.

310
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,958
Where d'you know her from?

311
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,236
Driving-school.

312
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,395
She taught me,

313
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,674
Venca and Miluna.

314
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,193
What is she to you?

315
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,236
Me? Nothing.

316
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,834
And what's this?

317
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,955
Well, what...

318
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,348
A friendly kiss.

319
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,272
It's normal for friends to kiss.

320
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,357
It may be normal elsewhere
but not here in Hostice.

321
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,108
How come she knew my name?
- By name?

322
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,430
She called me Miss Eva!

323
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,755
Even knew I'm still single.

324
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,433
I told her about you,

325
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,272
that we're going to marry.

326
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,438
And what's this?
- That's Wendy!

327
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,278
Mrs Feyfar just hands out

328
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,395
photos of her child?

329
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,750
Gaby...

330
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,558
I mean Mrs Feyfar!
...left it...

331
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,432
...for...

332
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,154
For whom?

333
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,231
For Venca Konopnik.

334
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,153
For him, but with you?!

335
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,839
He's getting married
so she couldn't very well...

336
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,633
She asked me

337
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,718
to give it to him and say
they think of him.

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,837
Well, that is all, or is there
anything else? What else?

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,958
Christ - poor Blazena!

340
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,353
Why's the light on?

341
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,948
I keep on about energy conservation...

342
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,548
Hi, Chief.

343
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,358
Where's everyone?

344
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,438
What's the matter now?
- Nothing.

345
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,357
"For Daddy from Wendy" - Who is that?

346
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,948
Imagine!

347
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,991
Venca Konopnik has a child with a woman
from Prague.

348
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,153
That's her, that's the kid.

349
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,758
She sure is some bird!

350
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,678
Beda, look!

351
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,958
She is a bird, she sure is...

352
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,952
She's a widow.

353
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,958
When she got pregnant
she married a rich old geezer

354
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,833
and he pegged out.

355
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,958
The kid is really Vencas's?

356
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,837
But not a word to anyone!

357
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,958
Girls, come quick!

358
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,549
Hey, hey, hey!

359
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,954
Wait for me!

360
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,429
I'll come last again.

361
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,750
I'll wait for you there!

362
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,837
Venca?
Nonsense, Mrs Kelisova.

363
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,278
May I go to West Germany

364
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,153
if I'm lying!

365
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,959
Eva said so,

366
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,150
showed me the photo.

367
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,788
With that peroxide hussy

368
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,387
who ran you down.

369
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,828
Poor Blazena.

370
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,069
Venca always was the village bull.

371
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,634
A typical Venca.
I keep saying that.

372
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,796
All this fornication!

373
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,752
This sinful man wants to enter
into marriage.

374
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,516
And there also...

375
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,557
Sodom and Gomorrah.

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,958
Do your duty, sisters!

377
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,192
Take your places, girls!

378
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,153
Did she tell you
who's the father?

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,355
I promised not to tell.

380
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,356
You can tell me, come on!

381
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,435
See, tell me. It is all the same.
- I cannot.

382
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,750
I tell you everything too.
Well, don't be silly.

383
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,711
But I really can't!

384
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,554
Beda just told me

385
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,353
the kid is Venca's.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,958
No!

387
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,834
...lawfully wedded.

388
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,667
Now it's out, I suppose...

389
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,758
I knew my clown
wasn't up to it.

390
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,548
Miluna, be my guest.
Well, sorry!

391
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,954
That's OK.

392
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,958
Be glad.
- Poor Blazena.

393
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,958
You're right.
- My God, I cannot drink this!

394
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,957
I'm so happy!

395
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,558
What is it, auntie.

396
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,635
Gimme some chewing-gum,

397
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,756
I'll go.

398
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,268
What?

399
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,751
What child?

400
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,150
What are you gabbing about?

401
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,913
If I'm gabbing...

402
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,470
Come on!

403
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,353
With a driving-school instructor,

404
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,160
she lives in Prague now.

405
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,157
What?

406
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,550
Miluna can tell you more,
she's been talking to her.

407
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,513
I don't believe it.

408
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,268
Hello Marenka!
- Don't call me Marenka!

409
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,357
They received a double zero.
- Swallow it up, the double zero.

410
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,755
That rascal of yours had
better watch out!

411
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,273
The shame of it!

412
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,238
They'll be drawing blood today.

413
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,434
Damn you!

414
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,153
Mrs. Matousova! Again?!

415
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,637
Isn't it enough for you that
you have been shot down twice already?

416
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,758
A handful of shit again!
She'd have knocked me down.

417
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,753
BBC emergency, this.

418
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,758
Witches' gathering!
To hell!

419
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,952
Tell me! That child!

420
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,753
The truth or I'll bash you one!

421
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,758
Don't shout at me,
ask them that know.

422
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,958
You talked to
that hussy from Prague!

423
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,711
Mrs, Feyfar.

424
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,915
And so what?

425
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,833
What is up?
Whose is that child?

426
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,958
Why don't you ask
your future son-in-law.

427
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,236
Son-in-law...

428
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,316
She spoke to Beda too,

429
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,310
left a message for Venca.

430
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,310
This is their Wendy.

431
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,953
Dear God!

432
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,833
God in heaven!

433
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,355
She's the image of him.

434
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,159
Show me!
- Take a look!

435
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,839
Well, really, it is so.

436
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,917
Christ in heaven!

437
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,959
See you tonight.

438
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,958
Good morning.

439
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,759
Good morning.

440
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,153
What's wrong?

441
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,834
Tonight, then.

442
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,153
Ciao.

443
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,960
What's the crowd outside?

444
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,038
Where've you been?
- With Venca.

445
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,230
Do you know her?
Sure.

446
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,355
You know her!

447
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,353
Will someone tell me
what happened?

448
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,278
Ask your Mum!

449
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,355
What happened?

450
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,556
Ask dear Venca
what happened!

451
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,756
Let that bull of an ox tell you!

452
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,154
He's got a bastard with some slut!

453
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,954
What's a slut, Mum?

454
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,275
You idiot!

455
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,038
Nonsense!
I keep telling you!

456
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,076
Shame on you,

457
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,115
lying to your own mother!

458
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,316
She told Miluna.
Ask in the cooperative.

459
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,357
She came here by car
and looked for him.

460
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,278
She left him a message and photograph!

461
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,355
It could be you

462
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,476
as a child!
Look at her nose!

463
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,278
Leave me alone!
Little nose...

464
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,316
Dad, tell her she's daft.

465
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,470
He needn't tell me anything, me!

466
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,153
It's you
he should bash up!

467
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,753
I shan't outlive the same of it!

468
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
Was it not enough?
First with Miluna,

469
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,835
now this.
And now this.

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,955
It's just gossip,
I'll ask him.

471
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,752
Don't you dare go to him!
I would have to break your legs

472
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,347
if you went there again!

473
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,392
Let him come and own up!
- And why own up, tell me?!

474
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,557
I'm telling you,
I had nothing on with her!

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,833
I'll have it out with Beda and Miluna!

476
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,194
Where're you going!
- To Venca's!

477
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,669
Back, I tell you, Blazena!

478
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,268
Blazena!
- You're not going!

479
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,355
Noooo...

480
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,352
Over my dead body!
- Mummy...

481
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,917
Such goings-on.

482
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,998
And you offered to do
a church wedding...

483
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,835
Blaza, please,

484
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,194
it's just silly gossip!

485
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,238
So whose is the child?
- How would I know?!

486
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,958
His!
And there's proof!

487
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,756
You can't go by a photo,

488
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,798
and Venca swears!
- Swears, yeah...

489
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,150
You're staying in!

490
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,390
Don't make such a scene...

491
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,755
What scene?
- The whole village's watching!

492
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,559
Let them see

493
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,107
what's going on,
better than on television!

494
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,038
And that's that.

495
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,438
She's doing this on purpose,
a week before the wedding.

496
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,756
What's she doing on purpose?

497
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:09,273
I'm defending the family honour

498
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,634
against that... that...
I hate saying what!

499
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,028
Now just say it, say it!

500
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,276
Who knows the whole truth.

501
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,714
Maybe you only needed my Venca
to save the girl's honour!

502
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,756
Shut up, will you?!

503
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,955
Of course!
Who knows,

504
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,355
the kid could be anyone's!

505
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,392
It stinks to high heaven,
all these men around!

506
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:31,353
What did you say?

507
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,395
I can smell blood, Father.

508
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,278
Help me up, girls!

509
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,960
'T would be small wonder!

510
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,275
That engineer you buttered up,

511
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,755
pushing the girl into his bed!

512
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,553
What?!
- Just ignore her, woman.

513
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,758
I'll kill her!
She'd say this about my girl?

514
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,752
I'm not scared of you!

515
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,154
Smell my fist!

516
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,157
Hold me back! Where are you?

517
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,948
Or I'll make her mug uglier still!

518
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,150
Look at her getting an attack!

519
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,356
Isn't she a crazy Marianne?

520
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,273
I bet I hit on it, it's true!

521
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,914
Lovely!

522
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,717
Hold me, girls!

523
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,358
Leave her alone,
or you'll be ill.

524
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,155
Let me go!
- Calm down,

525
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,237
your heart'll act up!

526
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,838
I can't stand this!
Ever ready, Father.

527
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,956
Let me go!

528
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,759
Don't let her provoke you!

529
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,958
Bloody filth.

530
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,347
Mum!

531
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,516
Let him marry

532
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,670
his Prague slut!

533
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,637
Venca's no catch for you, Blazena.

534
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,150
Blaza!

535
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,112
Don't demean yourself, son!
You'll be paying alimony anyway!

536
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,548
No alimony!

537
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,637
Who knows who's the father!

538
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,755
Mummy, please!

539
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,440
That widow from Prague's better!

540
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,518
A nice car, bags of money...

541
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,432
We'll build an extension at last!

542
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,833
If you build an extension,

543
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,753
we'll add a whole floor!

544
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,838
And we'll tile the front!

545
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,677
And find a better match

546
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,757
for Blazena!

547
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,958
You won't become Mrs Konopnik!

548
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,358
You gave me a fright.

549
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,557
How did all this come about?!

550
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,353
What? What do you mean?

551
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,353
You mean... her?

552
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,358
We had coffee...

553
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,557
What did she say?

554
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,550
What she said...
She said to be in Prague now.

555
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,909
And that her man died, or so.

556
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,956
That she earns good money...

557
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,150
And the child?

558
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,958
Wendy's her name?

559
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,594
I'd never have thought

560
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,954
you and she...

561
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,155
Do not start the same, you...

562
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,474
It's like a put-up job!

563
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,949
Excuse me, but...

564
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,833
Excuse me.

565
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,911
If I had her here I'd...

566
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,679
She's gone to Vienna

567
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,757
for 10 days.
- Ten days...

568
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,347
So you and she

569
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,431
really didn't...?

570
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,273
She laid just anyone.

571
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,675
You know her, don't you
- Do not tell me...

572
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,393
But I didn't...!

573
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,755
I'd rather hide somewhere!

574
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,030
So it could've been anyone's

575
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,753
and she throws it at you.

576
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,956
But what will you do now?

577
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,036
Blazena won't have you,

578
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,548
and you will surely not marry her,
will you.

579
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,637
You'd be a fool to.
So what now...?

580
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,355
Leave me alone!

581
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,039
You're as bad as the priest's old hags!

582
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,117
I should've known
it's your kid!

583
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,152
What would she want me for?

584
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,748
Just look at me!

585
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,235
Who'd marry me except some...

586
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,152
Some what?

587
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,237
A crazy short-sighted farmhand.

588
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,358
Crazy, short-sighted.

589
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,199
Telling you's like using a loudspeaker.

590
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,429
A good gossip's your scene,

591
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,590
instead of cooking a hot meal.

592
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,875
I made hamburgers yesterday!

593
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,793
That's all you ever make!

594
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,876
It is healthy.
- Yes, that's true.

595
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,954
Why get married anyway?

596
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,155
I am asking myself.

597
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,396
I don't need anything.

598
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,954
You monster.

599
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,355
Of course...
I can't look Venca

600
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,677
in the eyes now.
I told you not to tell -

601
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,552
but off you go, a - trumpeting.

602
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,478
My reputation now!

603
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,398
Imagine yourself in Blazena's shoes.

604
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,478
I'd drown, poison and hang myself.

605
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,672
Better and better...

606
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,637
You'd get rid if me.

607
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,637
You see...

608
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,748
You won't tell Eva,

609
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,268
will you?

610
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,318
There's nothing to tell. - What do you
mean there is nothing to tell?

611
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,958
D'you mean to say Gaby told you

612
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,958
Venca's the kid's a father?

613
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,755
Who else, surely not you?
Surely not you?

614
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,268
That would be the hell of a choice...

615
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,358
Yeah, she told me too
that it was Venca s.

616
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,960
You see.

617
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,759
Any problems?

618
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,235
No.

619
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,552
Turn the light off!

620
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,432
Go to sleep.

621
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,637
He'll marry the woman from Prague!
To spite them!

622
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,949
Well, well...

623
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,237
Your Blazena can take a running jump!

624
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,552
I can't sleep.

625
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,239
What a nuissance!

626
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,958
I'll take another pill.

627
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,717
It's so late

628
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,239
and Christ alive, the shame of it.

629
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,039
Shame across the village!

630
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,949
Stop snoring,

631
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,434
I'm thinking!

632
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,596
What am I supposed to do at night?

633
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,637
Do some thinking with me!
- I am thinking.

634
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,637
So I hear!

635
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,157
We'd do best to move away.

636
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,958
The shame of it!

637
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,438
Everybody knows, so what.

638
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,639
Such a pretty little girl.

639
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,432
And the boy says nothing,
fool as he is.

640
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,393
And her mother's elegant.

641
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,677
I like the looks of her.

642
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,958
Better than Blazena...

643
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,594
I'll have it out with her.

644
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,677
Me push my girl
into somebody's bed?!

645
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,958
How can you fool - such a shame!

646
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,557
Ph... shame!

647
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,838
Our Blazena is going to make
a good match.

648
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,358
I shall to that.

649
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,958
You'll go green with envy!

650
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,157
You three-coloured engineer... and...

651
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,358
And that's that.
I can't fall asleep.

652
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,557
My home, sweet home...

653
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,960
Send out telegrams:

654
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,547
"Wedding postponed because of illness".

655
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,750
Why go into details.

656
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,552
Hallo, mummy, we are here.

657
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,557
Now then, careful...

658
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,268
Here's the list of addresses.

659
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,960
Okay, okay... - And the money, do you
have it? Mind you're back by lunch -

660
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,958
no loitering about!
- Okay, okay...

661
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,552
Now your feet, Mum.

662
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,273
Our neighbours have stopped existing.

663
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,152
Don't you dare look that way!

664
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,958
We'll never talk to them again!

665
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,958
Jirka II see to you.
Just hold him tight. That s it. Jirka!

666
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,913
No, I'm going with Dad!
- No!

667
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,873
Help me with Gran!
I'll turn her round to make sure.

668
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,958
Slowly!
- Down, quickly!

669
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,358
Turn... Feet forwards!

670
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,958
You're as stupid as your Dad...

671
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,436
Slowly, you rascal!

672
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,557
Me again?!
Some summer holiday!

673
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,675
Don't kick Gran

674
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,757
or I'll land you such a slap!

675
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,958
She's peeping out, that old cow.
- What a bitch!

676
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,237
Here are the addresses
and remember: You write -

677
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,318
"The wedding is off,
the mother-in-law's gone mad."

678
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,958
Yes, all right.

679
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,155
Such talk...

680
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,311
Gone mad I will!

681
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,358
Stuff it down your throat.

682
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,873
You may need it
for that lady engineer.

683
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,797
We need no trash from you!

684
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,347
And write what you want
into the telegrams!

685
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,358
Such a beautiful pram!
But she will destroy it like this!

686
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,958
I'd rather sit in the dark.

687
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,157
Jesus...

688
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,358
Piss off with your china.

689
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,759
- Jezismarja!

690
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,838
The dirty bastards!

691
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,952
Turn me round!
Come here!

692
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,958
You're a s heavy as a tank.

693
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,114
Old junk as presents!

694
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,474
It hardly work!

695
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,795
She's going to break it!

696
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,838
Watch it yourself!
We have not asked you for that!

697
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,355
And that's it!

698
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,119
Daddy has given a bribe to
the head of the electrical shop.

699
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,155
We're buying a colour set anyway!

700
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,237
I'd rather throw it to the pigs!

701
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,557
No! That's ours!
- Mine!

702
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,916
Ours!

703
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,958
Pull yourselves together, girls!

704
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,197
What is, Father?

705
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,277
Think of the unborn child

706
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,958
and sin no more!

707
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:12,554
There is nothing to do here
your dignity.

708
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,829
As the mother I refuse

709
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,150
to give my only son
to such people - look at her!

710
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,152
What if she starts beating him?

711
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,277
Your only son can piss off.

712
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,760
The bastard s off with any skirt!

713
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,677
Why should our Blazena

714
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,757
marry such a whore-monger, Father?

715
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,958
What language, dear God...
I heard nothing.

716
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,958
Do not make hasty decisions.

717
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,958
Let the young people talk it out

718
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,032
and make their decision.

719
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:48,434
There's nothing to decide.

720
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,239
The wedding's off!

721
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,271
No, the wedding's on!
He's not the only man around.

722
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,358
I shan t let the girl suffer in shame.

723
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,958
I'll see she makes a good match!

724
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,117
This can't go on.

725
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,358
This is too much!

726
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,478
This!
How would I explain

727
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,557
when I'm called to make accounts?

728
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,277
It must be clarified!

729
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,550
And now!

730
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:29,637
Venca!

731
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,958
I want a word with you!

732
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,958
Help!

733
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,038
God alive, what is it?

734
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,117
What are you doing? Be careful!

735
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,358
Switch me off, for God's sake!

736
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,958
Take me down!

737
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,038
A miracle, Father!

738
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,157
You're alight!

739
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,958
Cecily!
Somebody...! Take me down!

740
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,954
Miracle!

741
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,838
All right?

742
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,958
Hold on, carefully...

743
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,474
Are you all right?

744
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,432
Thank you, what a fright...

745
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,074
You wanted something?

746
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:31,588
Make it up with Blazena.

747
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,637
The unborn babe does not deserve
for you to scorn it.

748
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,472
I don't.
Just leave it to us!

749
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:42,677
Hold on to me!

750
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,958
Carefully now!
- Ouch!

751
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,597
I'll make a poultice...

752
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,757
Let's make it...
Halloooo!

753
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,117
Hand me that!

754
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,550
Come here!
Hand me that!

755
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,353
Gimme, you little bastard!

756
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,277
Gran!

757
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,360
D you know this?

758
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,672
Something stupid again?

759
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,148
A game, see.

760
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,197
Put it down - and jerk it back.

761
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,358
You have a try.

762
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,958
Put it down, jerk it back.

763
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,958
That'll be fun!

764
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,677
And now watch me!
That's mine, you little bastard!

765
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,958
Give it to me, you rascal! My God

766
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,677
they take everything,
the shitty bastards!

767
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,757
I want to show you!

768
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,117
Watch... take a stone
and wrap it into a banknote

769
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,117
wind the thread round it

770
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,117
and throw...

771
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,557
Then lie in wait
for who falls for it!

772
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,434
I'll lie in wait!

773
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:16,518
I'm off with the boys,
you just lie in wait!

774
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,797
Take a stone...

775
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,277
wrap it up
twist and twist...

776
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,757
Don't cry, it's only gossip.
Here you are.

777
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,557
The things I have to listen to!

778
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,036
Venca didn't come,
didn't say a thing.

779
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:52,760
Give it to me!
I will...

780
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,797
Maybe your folks didn't let him.

781
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,438
It'll work out all right.

782
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,153
Venca isn't such a...

783
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,952
Sure he is!

784
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:08,038
Everyone's saying that kid
on the photo's like him!

785
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,958
I don't want him!

786
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,038
I'm so unhappy.
- Well, take it easy...

787
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:21,152
Scram, Joseph!
I must talk to her.

788
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,351
You stay here, Pepa!
No, he can scram, the traitor!

789
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,677
It really is just gossip,

790
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,438
cross my heart or hope to die!

791
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,518
I don't believe a word!

792
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:37,159
When I find out who caused this

793
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,918
I'll kill him on the spot!

794
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,958
Even if I get a life sentence.

795
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,036
Go away!
I do not even want to see you again!

796
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,755
Why re you screaming?

797
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,552
You heard, Venca, didn't you?!

798
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,597
Was that meant for me?
- Of course.

799
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,431
The bastard!
You're quite a man.

800
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,958
You stop howling! Or I will give you
more to have a reason!

801
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,958
Come and have coffee, Joe -

802
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,038
come for a talk this afternoon.

803
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,155
And I wanted to ask you...

804
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,958
Where's my car!

805
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,432
That bed's always in the way.

806
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,960
What...?

807
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,958
What a fun!

808
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,358
Stupid tricks,

809
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,958
at your age, shame on you!

810
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:29,557
He fell for it!

811
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:41,557
Just imagine, her mother

812
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,512
has another suitor

813
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:47,512
lined up!

814
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,432
Ouch!
- Higher up!

815
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,958
Whom?

816
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,199
Fat Joseph.

817
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,237
Fat... yea, yea, yea. Yea?

818
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,958
What a scandal!

819
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,432
Now gargle, Father.

820
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,518
You can't keep squeaking like this.

821
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:23,552
I'm here!

822
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,478
Come in!

823
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,958
Come in, don't be shy!

824
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:43,157
The house is Blazena s.

825
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,150
And she also has a garden.

826
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:49,956
90 thousand in the bank,

827
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,356
all hers...

828
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,751
Lumbago, that hurts!

829
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,150
I know that to do!

830
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:11,829
Mummy, hurry!
Come and have a look!

831
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,434
What is?
- Quickly!

832
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,557
Come and see this!

833
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,353
What on earth?

834
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,954
It look s like they're...

835
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:33,349
But the other way round...?

836
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:36,954
I don't know this one...

837
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:39,952
She won't want me,

838
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,958
I'm too fat.
- Fat? Where?

839
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,949
Do not worry, Pepi!
Just leave it to me.

840
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:49,353
How about a drink?

841
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,360
I don't believe it!

842
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,353
The girls said so.
- My goodness!

843
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,956
Look at that!

844
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,157
You're going to marry Joseph!
- I'd rather be an unwed mother.

845
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,356
I wouldn't outlive the shame!

846
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,954
I do not want people pointing at us...

847
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,753
What do you want? Joseph...

848
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,434
Such a decent man,
doesn't sit at the pub,

849
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,159
he's got his own flat,

850
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,469
car and video -

851
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,556
what more do you want?

852
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,268
That's not everything...

853
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,356
You shut up!

854
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,436
Your brain's bloated with beer!

855
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:33,516
What did you say?!
- Just the truth!

856
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,750
He's so fat!
- Of course he is fat,

857
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,757
but nice.

858
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,559
Who'll have you, pregnant?

859
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,755
So he's stout,

860
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,559
you get fat types on TV too!

861
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,552
And why? Because they are prosperous.

862
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,949
But I...

863
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,438
I don't love him! - She says
she does not love him any more!

864
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,954
You'll marry him, that's that!

865
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,157
I can't even eat in peace!

866
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:11,952
We have the wedding as planned.

867
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,952
In the morning you made me
call it all off and now...

868
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,755
And ignore that bastard next door!

869
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,838
His mother brags

870
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,956
about their wonderful bride.

871
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:29,952
Let them have as many as they want!
You'll get married too.

872
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:32,554
But decently!

873
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:37,353
Not another word!

874
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,557
I want a drink!
Or I'll peg out!

875
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,360
We are here

876
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,152
to reveal sin,

877
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,954
fight and erase sin.

878
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,757
What?
- We've got to erase it.

879
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:01,554
Because it is written:

880
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,157
Let not the weeds impure

881
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,552
seize the well-kept field

882
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,153
lest it suffocate the useful plants.

883
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,951
Cecily, pour out the grog,
I'll put a tape on.

884
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,554
The Song of Bernadette.

885
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,755
Stop smacking you lips!

886
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,753
Stop hitting me!
Smack yours too!

887
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,954
But you do not have any, do you?
- You witch...

888
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,958
Fear me not, dear chld,

889
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,949
come to me!
Come closer.

890
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,829
It's me, you idiot,

891
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,355
down!
Here!

892
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,750
Blazena!

893
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,550
What was that?

894
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,952
I'm not snoring!
I'm not even asleep...

895
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,952
Open up, it's me!

896
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,960
Don't be so silly!

897
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,956
Silly, is she?!

898
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:15,554
Just you try coming again!

899
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,949
Tear him up, Pinda!

900
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,755
Sweet home...

901
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,956
Chief...!

902
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,358
Shall I recite a poem for you?

903
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,552
One day in the park

904
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,351
I found a coin, a mark.

905
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,557
Nobody could care less
it was East German, careless!

906
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,358
Shut up, you'll end up in jail...

907
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,751
And here they come!
So... check in...

908
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,353
"This isn't the barracks; the Co-op."

909
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:27,556
Just a moment.
Television!

910
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,951
Yes, speaking.

911
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:36,349
Czechoslovak Television.

912
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,556
And so what.

913
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,753
On the 18th.

914
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,949
It is Saturday comrade.

915
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,157
Saturday is a working-day for us anyway.

916
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,954
The harvest's on!

917
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,952
We'll be expecting you.

918
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,358
I'm Radl, the Chief.

919
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,159
Understand? OK.
Saturday morning then, early.

920
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:03,150
And come as soon as you can!

921
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,356
Bye bye, salute.
- On Friday...

922
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,949
So they will come on the eighteenth.

923
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:10,873
We'll be in the news?
- It's about the people

924
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,833
who most helped
our victory in the milk league

925
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,559
through the Simon method.

926
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:19,552
So they won't take office shots.

927
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,275
You can listen in,

928
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,960
Joseph II arrange the equipment.

929
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,668
You beast!
Do you happen to know, chairman

930
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,360
we sing that Walkyrie song, and how?!

931
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,148
In the year sixty six

932
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,152
when peace will be everywhere
and you will be an engineer

933
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,550
and we will be going out together

934
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,956
along the path to Protivin,
which is so short. - What are you doing?

935
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,954
See, I don't need any equipment.

936
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,552
The best collective?
That'll be something.

937
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:05,557
It's either the Skopek
or Konopnik woman!

938
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,755
How'll you decide?!

939
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,949
Heavens above!

940
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:12,152
LAST D AYS OF POMPE Y

941
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:35,952
No!
- Chairman!

942
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,559
It'll be a fiasco!

943
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,958
Which of em works better this week

944
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,157
will be on television!
