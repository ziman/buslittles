ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,479
Eda!

3
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,395
Mum, just a few more minutes.

4
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,076
Prague -
September 1945.

5
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,988
The Nazis have been defeated.
The Communists haven't yet taken over.

6
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,512
Put your hat on properly!

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,076
Don't lose it!

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,034
Let me look at you.
Straight there, then home.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,391
Give me some.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,716
Screenplay

11
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,235
Starring

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,950
Sound

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,629
Music

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,832
Director of Photography

17
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,916
Directed by

18
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,278
- That'd be something!
- What?

19
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,672
If I could play like that
I could earn money in pubs.

20
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,916
Mum and Dad'll probably
buy me a full-size violin now.

21
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,109
Violins just screetch
but an accordion...

22
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,397
- A liter of beer.
- I'll be right back.

23
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,758
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, mate!

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,719
Want some? Here.

25
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,274
- Daddy, come home!
- I can't leave yet.

26
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,437
Tell Mum the cards
are going Dad's way

27
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,872
and if he stopped now
he'd ruin the family!

28
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,797
- Trump!
- Come and get it!

29
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,830
Here you are!

30
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,074
My husband's back
from the tram tracks!

31
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,954
- Can't you clear away?
- In a minute!

32
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,396
Look at the time!

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,512
I can't enjoy my dinner unless
I've finished what I'm doing!

34
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,714
You take her, Eda. The dinner's
been ready for ages!

35
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,472
She'll settle down if
you push her over the bump.

36
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,198
Come and hold the light for me.

37
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,554
You're so clumsy!

38
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,753
It's a temporary connection.

39
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,155
Hold this red resistor up
to this wire... here...

40
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,235
What's the matter with you?

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,834
Don't hit him on the head.
He'll become stupid.

42
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,474
Become? He already is!

43
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,589
Chroust said how could you
who put matches in the cockets,

44
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,110
- call yourself an electrician?
- You telling me what to do?

45
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,554
Tell Chroust we wanted
it painted straight.

46
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,399
Not crooked.

47
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,235
You call that straight?

48
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,316
Every day I have to look at it.
His sloppy work!

49
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,509
Don't step on the couch
in your slippers!

50
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,113
Hold it.

51
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,993
If this doesn't work,
I don't know what will.

52
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,035
Turn that down!

53
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,434
Come and help me clear away.

54
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,711
- What was wrong?
- Stupid resistor!

55
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,308
How did you work out
what was wrong?

56
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,078
It's my job.

57
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,636
Good that you understand
these things.

58
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,878
Wash your hands.

59
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,511
Both of you.

60
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,234
Open your mouth.

61
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,315
It's good for your bones,
blood, the lot.

62
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,111
You're as thin as a beanpole.

63
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,071
Bon appetit!

64
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,830
Look at the way you're sitting!

65
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,756
Hook them over your shoulders.

66
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,072
You're a growing boy.
You've got to sit up straight!

67
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,830
You know
how Mr Chroust walks.

68
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,269
Chroust! An example?

69
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,391
Has the bearing of a soldier.

70
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,274
He sticks his chest out
like a pigeon.

71
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,271
Is Mr Chroust a Labour unionist?

72
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,996
- Mr Chroust's an idiot.
- But a Labour unionist too.

73
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,517
You can have clever Labour unionist,
like Mr Ludvik...

74
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,070
Every political party has
clever and stupid members.

75
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,158
Which party has
the most idiots?

76
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,748
Eat up, it'll get cold.

77
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,510
You can't talk to kids
about this sort of thing.

78
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,632
Now he'll tell Chroust
that he's an idiot.

79
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,910
At least he'd know at last.

80
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,880
If there are male and
female flowers on a plant...

81
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,634
Please don't whistle like that!

82
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,072
Examples of which are the birch,
hazel and cucumber.

83
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,358
I can't cane you. You don't
care about your results.

84
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,636
You won't see reason.

85
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,309
You can stand on your heads
for all I care.

86
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,758
It's your fault what becomes
of you. I just do my job.

87
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,509
There are many flowers
with male and female partners.

88
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,070
She's only wearing that smock.

89
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,350
- Who?
- What's that?

90
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,751
She's not wearing knickers.

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,318
She doesn't wear anything
underneath when it's hot.

92
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,232
She must have some shorts on!

93
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,955
Women don't wear shorts.

94
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,477
He must know.
He's repeated her class.

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,719
It shows when she sits down.

96
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,877
But you have to get up close.

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,836
They fly from flower to flower.
In cemeteries, gardens...

98
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,112
This is how they
fertilize the trees.

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,275
That's much better.

100
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,514
That's how you're meant
to behave.

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,076
This is how you'll learn about
nature and its mysteries.

102
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,868
Only bumble-bees
can get into some flowers

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,754
because of their long proboscis.

104
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,395
In chestnut tree flowers
you'll only see bumble-bees.

105
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,758
Sometimes the trees attract
ordinary bees,

106
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,149
but they soon realize
their proboscis is too short.

107
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,510
Bumble-bees also like clover.

108
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,231
- She is wearing some.
- So tell me their colour!

109
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,954
Pink ones, like my Mum's.

110
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,955
Yes, pink clover is a feast
for bumble-bees.

111
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,475
He had the same name as you?

112
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,868
Yeah.

113
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,799
Ugh!

114
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,598
What was he like?

115
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,315
I don't know.
He died before I was born.

116
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,834
They said he was a good boy.

117
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,793
When he died,
Mum took sleeping pills

118
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,754
because she didn't want
to live any more.

119
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,190
But they pumped out her stomach
and saved her.

120
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,675
Must've been horrible.

121
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,429
Yeah.

122
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,993
What happened to your brother?

123
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,352
He stood on a rusty nail
and his foot got infected.

124
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,717
That's why they're so careful
with me.

125
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,591
They don't want
anything to happen to me.

126
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,990
I'm not surprised, but
why give you the same name?

127
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,153
I'm a replacement.

128
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,715
You're a substitute.

129
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,034
School announcement.

130
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,394
We've acquired some tickets for
a performance of "The Idiot".

131
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,353
Any parents who want to see
"The Idiot", come and see me.

132
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,836
Our Principal's an idiot!

133
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,270
Silence! Be quiet!

134
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,916
Fakir, magician and juggler
Raji Tamil

135
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,517
will perform for us today...

136
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,950
I now ask the audience
to give me a word.

137
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,834
Cretin!

138
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,872
Toilet!

139
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,794
You're a disgrace!

140
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,875
The fakir will think
you don't know any other words!

141
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,831
Whore!

142
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,478
I can write it.

143
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,716
My feet can write any word

144
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,150
but they prefer to write
more beautiful words.

145
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,793
Say "spring".

146
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,912
Spring!

147
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,076
That's a very beautiful word.

148
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,196
Here are three hoops.
They're joined together.

149
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,919
Try to pull them apart,
check they've no joints...

150
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,397
There's no trickery

151
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,558
Now, give me the hoops and
I'll show you some magic.

152
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,755
Give the hoops back
so our guest can continue.

153
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,271
Give them back right now!

154
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,148
- We don't have them!
- They're not here!

155
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,197
If I get them back, you'll see
magic not on the program.

156
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,320
I'll swallow fire!

157
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,473
Quiet!

158
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,115
If you don't give back the hoops
when I count to three

159
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,118
not only will Mr Mrazek...

160
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,038
Raji Tamil is my name...

161
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,035
...not only will the fakir
not swallow fire,

162
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,274
but you'll go back to your
classes and continue lessons.

163
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,239
One...

164
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,599
two...

165
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,751
three...

166
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,312
End of the performance,
back to your classes!

167
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,319
I'll search you all myself,
you wretches!

168
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,470
Whoever has it will get
a "C" for behaviour!

169
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,749
Because it's theft!

170
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,236
Shame for the whole school!

171
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,309
I've never experienced this
before in my life!

172
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,679
Were those your only hoops?
No reserves?

173
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,632
Cretins!

174
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,829
They've disappeared
into the ground!

175
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,716
Want to see something?

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,192
Blimey!

177
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,949
But the head said
it was stealing.

178
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,395
It was a good laugh, eh?

179
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,632
Hi, Mum!

180
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,199
Hi!

181
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,272
Nice bike.

182
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,274
- It's my Dad's.
- But he doesn't use it.

183
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,558
He does when
he's late for work.

184
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,275
We'll have to dismantle it,
specially the mud-guards.

185
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,195
Dad might be angry.

186
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,791
He'll be glad we made a light
half-racing bike out of it.

187
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,994
They've problems again,
haven't they?

188
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,072
- And don't come back!
- I won't come back.

189
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,357
All those men I turned down!

190
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,393
Voracek,
Frantik from the butcher's,

191
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,194
I was a virgin then!

192
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,757
- Look where I ended up!
- My heart's packing up!

193
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,390
Nice people, eh?
Happens every day.

194
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,671
You don't have neighbours
like that, do you?

195
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,958
No.

196
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,598
- Why do they fight like that?
- He can't please her.

197
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,870
What do you mean?

198
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,912
I don't know.

199
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,073
Help me pour this away.

200
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,797
Just you see, he'll be
wearing black again.

201
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,312
Ready again?

202
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,511
You heard it?

203
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,033
My heart's packing up.

204
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,150
- Where's he going?
- To his coffin.

205
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,075
I'll have a heart attack
any minute.

206
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,395
It has to be.

207
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,911
You must enjoy yelling
at each other.

208
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,270
Think I enjoy it?

209
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,957
Ask her if she likes it!

210
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,552
Tormenting a person to death!

211
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,476
When she starts shouting,
he shaves and dresses in black

212
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,912
so she won't have to do
anything when he is dead.

213
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,831
Just in case you want
to hang yourself!

214
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,912
See that?

215
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,196
I don't know
what Dad's going to say.

216
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,916
Looks good.
See what I've got for you.

217
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,597
You'll think it's brill!

218
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,557
You'll kill that baby!

219
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,839
So it works! Now you can
look after the baby

220
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,394
- while you ride your bike.
- Yeah!

221
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,198
Watch out!

222
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,719
We all know that "Prague"
begins with a capital "P".

223
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,154
Be careful when you're writing
the adjective.

224
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,110
It's the same with other towns.

225
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,875
Who's going to write it
on the board? Eda!

226
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,039
Do stop whistling!

227
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,349
Good. Sit down.

228
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,912
One more time
and you're off to Vrsovice.

229
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,198
They'll sort you out there!

230
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,112
I want to go to Vrsovice.

231
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,472
I think we overslept!

232
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,631
You think or you know?

233
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,753
We didn't set
the alarm clock properly.

234
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,630
Half past six instead of six.

235
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,998
We didn't? You mean you didn't!

236
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,432
- Sorry, I got it wrong!
- You can't do anything!

237
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,839
Don't be angry with me!
You'll get there on time...

238
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,475
...if you take your bike.

239
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,752
You can eat some strudel
and an apple on the way.

240
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,439
Riding, strudel in one
hand, apple in the other!

241
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,672
So don't go far.
It looks like rain.

242
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,676
What a lovely baby!

243
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,198
You like it with
so much goose fat?

244
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,279
We didn't have it during
the war but now we do.

245
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,554
It's home-made,
my sister made it.

246
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,638
- I'm off. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

247
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,512
- You know who died?
- No.

248
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,757
- Mrs Klecankova.
- I didn't know her.

249
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,955
Yes you did. The skinny one.

250
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,353
And young.
She wasn't even fifty.

251
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,835
Well, goodbye, then.

252
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,512
Feed it out... a bit more...

253
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,988
Hold it there...

254
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,679
Hi.

255
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,158
- What are you doing?
- Can't you see?

256
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,199
- Are they live?
- No, dead.

257
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,232
- Isn't it dangerous?
- Yeah.

258
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,716
Ever chewed gum? Got any left?

259
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,869
- I've only got half left.
- Give him some.

260
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,713
It's American, but don't
swallow it, just chew it.

261
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,997
- Thanks.
- Give me some, too.

262
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,031
Shove off.

263
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,677
You bums!

264
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,199
Get that pram away from here!

265
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,598
- How high will it go?
- 1000 metres.

266
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,919
Shit!

267
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,315
Out of the way!

268
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,238
Don't touch it!

269
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,676
Wait till I catch you,
you little sods!

270
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,557
It needed a longer pipe
or a different fuel.

271
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,033
- What's up with him?
- What's the matter?

272
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,998
I swallowed the gum.

273
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,628
It won't hurt you.

274
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,038
- But there's no more left!
- We'll get some more.

275
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,438
Look!

276
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,512
'Bye!

277
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,114
It's Dad. He took the bicycle
that's why he's home earlier.

278
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,675
Where are my mud-guards?

279
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,470
Where are they?

280
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,235
You rascal!

281
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,553
Not with that!

282
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,350
If you cripple him...

283
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,071
Don't hide behind a woman,
you coward!

284
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,912
On all fronts.

285
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,351
- Even the Germans?
- Dad said on all fronts.

286
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,438
How could Germans sing
"Roll out the barrels"

287
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,630
when they can't speak the language.

288
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,318
The Americans and the Russians
sang it as they marched.

289
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,919
And the Japanese?

290
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,519
I don't know.

291
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,119
And the partisans?

292
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,869
How could they sing
in hiding, stupid?

293
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,595
Who threw that?

294
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,876
See what I mean?

295
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,116
Miss Mayova won't be teaching
due to a prolonged illness,

296
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,837
so she won't be coming back
soon, maybe never.

297
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,875
Your new teacher
will be Mr. Hnizdo.

298
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,673
Let's welcome him.
I know that

299
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,191
his experience with
the anti-Nazi resistance

300
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,753
will help him to handle
you... where is Rosenheim?

301
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,919
He's not here!

302
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,917
...and soften up those
"heroes" among you.

303
00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,589
The reputation of the class
is shattered.

304
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,598
Shattered.

305
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,195
I wish you much success.

306
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,272
My name is Igor Hnizdo.

307
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,355
Some idiot whistled.
So I threw a stone at him.

308
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,391
- What is your name, boy?
- Rosenheim.

309
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,233
You know you're late?

310
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,314
Not that late.

311
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,909
Four and half minutes.
Hold out your hand.

312
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,431
Now the other one.

313
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,439
Two for arriving late
and two for whistling outside.

314
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,437
It wasn't me!

315
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,875
And two for lying.

316
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,953
You're not allowed to hit us.

317
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,712
Correct. Corporal punishment
at school is forbidden.

318
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,593
With one exception.

319
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,315
This class.

320
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,999
A class that drives its teacher
into an asylum must be beaten.

321
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,391
Ministry of Education
issued a decree.

322
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,588
For your interest
it's decree no. 284/ C/1945.

323
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,952
I'll beat you with this medieval
instrument if you behave

324
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,430
as if in the Middle Ages.

325
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,632
It's for your own good.

326
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,548
You'll thank me each time
and we'll shake hands

327
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,196
to show our friendship
hasn't suffered.

328
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,076
Let's demonstrate with these
boys who aren't listening.

329
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
Thank you.

330
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,273
Thank you.

331
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,479
Teachers are sent here
as a punishment.

332
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,589
In this part police used
to patrol only on horses...

333
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,760
...and always in pairs.

334
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,269
I chose to come to this
appalling school because

335
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,188
I used to volunteer
for the front line.

336
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,113
I never feared the Nazis,

337
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,955
so I should be able
to cope with you.

338
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,469
It's a 635 calibre.
A small weapon.

339
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,594
War criminals are still at large.

340
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,594
Not all scores...

341
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,316
...are settled.

342
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,594
Where're you off to?

343
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,678
I'm bringing Dad his dinner.

344
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,799
Your boy's here, OK?

345
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,952
- They're transformers.
- I know.

346
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,231
That's you.

347
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,271
What d'you mean?

348
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,908
They call you "the Transformer".

349
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,350
Everyone has a nickname here.
Look.

350
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,994
When we're doing repairs,
I use this rod

351
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,830
to test the transformer.

352
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,110
If it doesn't spark,
I know there's no current

353
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,915
and I can touch it
with my bare hands.

354
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,953
Then I can let
the repairmen near it.

355
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,556
Aren't you afraid?

356
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,589
Yes, I could get burnt
to a cinder.

357
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,510
If I touch it
and don't turn black, it's OK.

358
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,755
- Has anyone ever got burnt?
- Yes, Mr Hlavaty, Mr Hejplik...

359
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,033
What've you brought me, Camil?

360
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,476
Nothing for you.
And I'm not called Camil.

361
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,637
That's not very nice of you!

362
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,238
Not nice at all, Camil!

363
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,438
Just in time today.

364
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,632
Get ready, here we go...

365
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,319
Now!

366
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,919
It's all lit up!

367
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,948
He's started off well, inspector.

368
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,396
He has them well-disciplined.

369
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,279
- Leave him in the boys' class.
- Yes.

370
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,518
Is it true he taught music
in a girls' school?

371
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,312
Yes.

372
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,435
So he was sent here
as punishment?

373
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,597
Leave him in the boys' class.

374
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,431
Excuse me.

375
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,548
What are you doing here?

376
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,029
I'm watching the game.

377
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,957
Sorry.

378
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,598
My husband's a tram driver.

379
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,158
Really?

380
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,389
It's 3:3!

381
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,357
Excellent. Who scored?

382
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,959
Dusicka.

383
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,350
Excellent!

384
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,075
He couldn't suddenly
come home?

385
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,159
It would create
a real traffic jam.

386
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,632
He has to work according
to the timetable.

387
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,388
I have real coffee.

388
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,799
You've such a long hair!

389
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,199
Long hair - little brain, eh?

390
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,669
It's not a penalty if your hand
touches the ball by acci...

391
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,030
If it's by accident,
under no circumstances.

392
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,997
See?

393
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,439
You blind? Ball's out!

394
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,591
Dad painted that.

395
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,358
By himself?

396
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,435
From a postcard.
He can do anything.

397
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,029
Why's there a hole in every cake?

398
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,597
So I can see which ones
have cheese in them.

399
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,799
- I don't like cheese.
- I don't mind it.

400
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,748
If you like, I'll eat
all the cheese ones.

401
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,712
Go ahead.

402
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,955
- Men aren't so interesting.
- I don't go for them, either.

403
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,913
Wow!

404
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,070
You know what Stavinoha says?

405
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,715
The greatest delight is
to have a woman.

406
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,997
- You mean, as a wife?
- I suppose so.

407
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,869
I've seen my Mum naked.

408
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,435
So have I. In the bath.

409
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,233
- That doesn't count.
- I know.

410
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,392
D'you like the Fabian twins?

411
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,751
- Yeah.
- Which girl's better?

412
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,630
They're both the same.

413
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,072
On Friday evening you're going
to see something.

414
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,317
If you're not afraid of heights.

415
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,719
No I'm not.

416
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,910
OK, you'll see something.

417
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,672
Sorrow reigned across the land.

418
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,991
All eyes were on Constance.

419
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,478
The most treacherous of all
was King Sigismund.

420
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,475
Though he promised Hus safety,
he told the cardinals

421
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,990
not to believe Hus
and to burn him.

422
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,355
Hus could've saved himself
if he'd recanted,

423
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,472
and signed what they wanted.

424
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,277
How could he against
such false testimony?

425
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,235
He would've slained the truth
and for the truth he lived.

426
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,830
He said: "I would rather die."

427
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,551
So he was stripped of
his priesthood

428
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,077
and taken before King Sigismund

429
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,790
who ordered that an absurd hat
be placed on his head.

430
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,954
They tied him to a stake
and burned him alive.

431
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,551
The swine!

432
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,072
He was still singing
when they set fire to him.

433
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,395
He wasn't afraid of death.

434
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,673
He knew God would accept
him among his faithful.

435
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,632
Then the choking smoke,
kinder than the people,

436
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,709
took away his consciousness.

437
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,398
And his singing ceased.

438
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,837
He was no longer
among the living.

439
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,198
We shall remember that he died
for his convictions.

440
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,072
His message to us:
No man should be a coward!

441
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,272
He must honour the truth,

442
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,039
even if it costs him his life.

443
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,396
The fire raged,
on the bank of the Rhine,

444
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:34,276
the faithful
son of the nation dies.

445
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,670
And you ask:
"Who is in those flames?"

446
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,990
It is Jan Hus -
the most famous of Czechs.

447
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,032
Attention!
Important announcement!

448
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,156
Winter has arrived,
bringing the frosts.

449
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,629
The iron railings
in front of the school

450
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,071
can cause accidents.

451
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,832
Metal objects
become sticky in the frosts.

452
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:23,631
It is dangerous to touch
or even lick these objects.

453
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,477
I repeat:
Do not lick the iron railings.

454
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,716
Do not lick
the frozen door-handles.

455
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,751
End of the announcement.

456
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,796
You don't deserve it but we can't
put off your tenth birthday

457
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,918
until you start
behaving sensibly,

458
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,558
so from Mum you've got
a nice cake and from me...

459
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,829
An air-rifle!

460
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,672
It's not really an air-rifle...

461
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,038
...but it is a weapon.

462
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,398
Were you in the resistance?

463
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,029
Our teacher was.

464
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,992
In the resistance...

465
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,557
You know your Dad listened
to illegal radio.

466
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,469
He fixed his radio for it and
risked his life.

467
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,591
But he wasn't in the resistance.

468
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,319
Then there was that man
we hid illegally.

469
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,597
But you built barricades
and you weren't afraid!

470
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,711
I was afraid.

471
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,392
But you used a gun.

472
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,838
I had a gun.

473
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,950
Dad was a civilian.

474
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,397
He wasn't trained to fight.

475
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,630
Now you won't have to lean
your music against the pot.

476
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,872
Dad made it himself.

477
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,628
Do you like it?

478
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,558
Yes.

479
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,477
Music is
the most powerful weapon.

480
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,996
With music Czechs
conquered the world.

481
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,915
Smetana, Dvorak,
even Friml's "Donkey Serenade".

482
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,270
Let's put it to the test.

483
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,559
We don't have to,
it'll be fine.

484
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,719
Perhaps we could make
some improvements.

485
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,910
They have to get changed
for their dance class.

486
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,753
I don't think
we should do it.

487
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,954
Remember Hus died
for the Truth.

488
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,273
Perhaps it isn't him.

489
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,188
Mrazek - Juggler.
Can't be anyone else.

490
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,156
- Hey! Hi!
- Hi!

491
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,079
My friend wants to own up
that he stole your hoops.

492
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,113
He's brought them back.

493
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,438
Wait a moment.

494
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,837
Go get them!

495
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,831
Tear them apart!

496
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,871
At least you could bark,
you lazy animal!

497
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,878
Thieving bastards!

498
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,199
Know how much new ones cost?!

499
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,231
- Truth is stupid!
- No it isn't!

500
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,396
We're suffering like Hus!

501
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,679
Don't move! No-one move!

502
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,312
Don't try to do it yourself.
Hold on!

503
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,999
That's how you'll end up
if you don't hold on!

504
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,394
Don't be afraid of the flame.
It's for your own good!

505
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,556
Careful!

506
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,318
Didn't I warn them?

507
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,512
- Didn't you hear the warning?
- Yes, I did!

508
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,518
This isn't a school,
it's Sing-Sing!

509
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,512
Watch them!

510
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,834
All pedagogical methods
have failed.

511
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,469
They're so unpredictable.

512
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,949
I don't think you should
announce dangers over the radio.

513
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,750
That way you point them out
and then they have to try it.

514
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,637
If I tell them: don't drink
acid it'll eat your insides,

515
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,753
you're telling me
they'll drink it?

516
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,314
I don't know, but better not
say anything on the radio.

517
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,157
I wanted to ask you - do you
know Lieutenant Molnar?

518
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,669
No.

519
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,395
He also fought
in Africa like you.

520
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,519
He doesn't know you either.

521
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,629
I wasn't there long - they
sent me to the Eastern front.

522
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,471
I don't like leaving them
on their own.

523
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,788
Hello.

524
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,190
A litre of beer.

525
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,718
Hi!

526
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,631
Let's go, Dad.

527
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,519
Mum wants me
to bring you back.

528
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,277
I'll fleece you!

529
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,993
Look at that!

530
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,910
Give him one!

531
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,630
Where you get
all these trumps from?

532
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,432
Greetings!

533
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,871
Look who's here!

534
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,471
In trouble again!

535
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,432
You said it.

536
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,591
Didn't think I'd make it here.

537
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,756
For the last journey.

538
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,712
I need it.

539
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,189
My heart's about to give in.

540
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,192
Give it here.

541
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,636
Let's see
if this will flush him out!

542
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,434
It's really smoky
in there today!

543
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,595
It's your smoking
that's done it!

544
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,191
Who did it?

545
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,876
I thought I'd had it!

546
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,477
Tonda, come and see what Dad
won at cards for you!

547
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,515
I won an accordion!

548
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,359
Come and sit with us, ladies.

549
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,154
Make some room, boys.

550
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,990
We're talking about Dvorak,

551
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,671
how it was lucky
he didn't become a butcher

552
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,270
but a composer
who conquered the world.

553
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,269
In America
where he was invited...

554
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,631
What's the matter?

555
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,391
They said the gypsies
were on the side of the Germans.

556
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,080
- Who said that?
- Everyone.

557
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,911
In our partisan division
we had to stop

558
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,159
a German motorized convoy
in the mountains.

559
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,630
A Slovak gypsy said
to his commander:

560
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,589
"My face is darker, I'll be
well hidden in the rock.

561
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,950
Give me that anti-tank bomb."

562
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,629
And, boys...
and girls,

563
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,672
he gave it to that Nazi
tiger right in the belly!

564
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,113
The gypsies were good fighters.

565
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,429
Shame so many of them perished
in concentration camps.

566
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,953
Anyone wants me to teach them
the violin?

567
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,319
Women play in Orchestras today.

568
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,510
I'd like to!

569
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,157
If only you could play
like that one day.

570
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,151
Do you think he's got talent?

571
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,989
It seems to me he only
makes a noise.

572
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,075
He's got talent and a musical
ear, but he's got to work!

573
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,792
Hear that?

574
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,752
Off you go!

575
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,631
Careful! You nearly had
your teacher's eye out!

576
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,391
Are you all right?

577
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,272
I'm fine.

578
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,512
Hello. How's it going?

579
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,437
He nearly poked
his teacher's eye out!

580
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,755
- I didn't mean to.
- It was nothing.

581
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,677
He got carried away.

582
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,515
- I'm Igor Hnizdo.
- Soucek.

583
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,388
- I'm glad you've taken them on.
- It was necessary.

584
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,712
Excellent soup.

585
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,752
Have some more.

586
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,349
How do you see
the political situation?

587
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,438
- The international situation?
- The works.

588
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,916
- I see our country as a bridge.
- No more thank you.

589
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,110
A bridge between
East and West.

590
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,756
Russia can learn democracy here

591
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,992
because they've never known it,
and the West will see

592
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:03,428
how freedom and socialism
can live under one roof.

593
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,993
We can show the world what
a small hard-working nation

594
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,078
can achieve
when no-one interferes.

595
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,188
Do you eat rabbit?
I cooked a rabbit.

596
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,915
Stalin said:
"What you bake, you will eat."

597
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,198
The Russians won't interfere

598
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,235
and the Germans are finished;
we've nothing to worry about.

599
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,318
These children can look forward
to a great future.

600
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,474
They'll be able to travel,
and see the world.

601
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,470
Dusicka and Lerch!

602
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,752
Hello.

603
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,992
- Hello, girls.
- Can we carry your books?

604
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,713
No thank you.
I've got trusty helpers.

605
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,669
- We've nothing to do.
- Really we haven't.

606
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,750
Sir...

607
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,760
Next time, boys.

608
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,838
Igor!

609
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,075
Ice-cream!

610
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,756
- Vanek's here!
- I was here first!

611
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,475
I've got three flavours
today!

612
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,073
He's lying.

613
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,312
- Who?
- Our teacher.

614
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,434
You can't be a parachutist,
partisan, political prisoner

615
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,034
and commander
of an armored train.

616
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,197
He wouldn't be able
to teach us if he lied!

617
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,836
He landed behind enemy lines
by parachute, at night.

618
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,116
He went into the woods to be
with his partisan division.

619
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,397
Then he was captured and put
into a concentration camp...

620
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,516
- He escaped...
- Escaped, did he?

621
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,838
It was impossible
to escape from the camps.

622
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,357
They were surrounded
by electrified barbed wire.

623
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,399
He could've dug his way out,
idiot.

624
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,957
And then he was a commander
in the revolt.

625
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,790
Just children's stories.

626
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,549
If he's allowed to carry
a revolver, he must have fought!

627
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,716
Who knows what he did
during the war.

628
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,115
You take that back!

629
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,910
No, I won't!

630
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,395
Take back what you said!

631
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,991
He won't take it back like that.
It's got to be like this!

632
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,831
- Eat it!
- Bastard!

633
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,796
I need two trusty helpers...

634
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:56,074
...to take a letter to Zizkov
school by 12 pm!

635
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,431
The Indian way -
what does that mean?

636
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,549
A hundred steps to walk,
a hundred steps to run!

637
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:10,590
It's very important, so my
messengers have to be fit

638
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,750
and must know how to find their
bearings in the terrain.

639
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,515
Leave your books here -
I'll wait until you get back.

640
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,670
Let's go to Zizkov by train.
The sand wagons are coming up!

641
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,876
- What if it doesn't go there?
- These tracks go there!

642
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,835
- I'm scared!
- Hold onto me!

643
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,391
- No!
- Chicken! I'll jump, then!

644
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,552
- I'm jumping!
- So am I!

645
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,669
I don't think we're going
to Zizkov.

646
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,037
We'll get off
at the next station.

647
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,714
Look - Prague, Hostivar.

648
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:45,029
We forgot that freight trains
never stop at stations.

649
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:53,039
If we'd gone to Zizkov,
it still wouldn't have stopped.

650
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,919
So it doesn't matter anyway.

651
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:00,192
True.
But it has to stop sometime.

652
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:05,110
When the lights are red
or if the coal runs out.

653
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,078
The tender's full of coal.

654
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,272
They have to stop for water.

655
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,277
You're right.

656
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,119
Look, a pump!

657
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,239
They could've taken water there.

658
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,999
They've got huge tanks.

659
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,954
They'll last
a hundred kilometres.

660
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,672
A hundred?

661
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,550
This is Benesov post office.
Is that Zizkov school?

662
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,988
Can I speak to Miss Melcova?

663
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,952
She's teaching?
I'll ring back in five minutes.

664
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,517
Tell her I'm going to call.
It's very important.

665
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,156
You can speak to
your teacher in five minutes.

666
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,395
Thank you.

667
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,239
What is so important
that you're in such a hurry?

668
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,034
- We can't tell anyone.
- Only her.

669
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,109
It must be a cipher.

670
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,829
Or a secret code.

671
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,915
Go to the booth.

672
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:47,596
We've got a message from
our teacher, Mr Hnizdo.

673
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,278
We couldn't get it to you
so we'll read it you.

674
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,913
"Igor repeats his challenge.

675
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,630
To remain a virgin
means not to blossom.

676
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:10,438
Another chance tonight.
Igor the Painless.

677
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,194
P.S. Answer by return of post."

678
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,516
Are you there, Miss?

679
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,916
She didn't even say
thank you.

680
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,116
- We're off.
- Yes.

681
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,029
- Thank you.
- Yes.

682
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,797
Did they pay?

683
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,433
No.

684
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,554
Come in.

685
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,472
Good afternoon.

686
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,433
Eda didn't come home
for lunch today.

687
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,752
Did he stay behind?

688
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,235
I sent him on an important
errand - for the school.

689
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,789
They should've been here
ages ago.

690
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,918
D'you think something's
happened to him?

691
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,278
No, they've probably wandered
off somewhere.

692
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,790
I'm really worried.
I've already lost one child.

693
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,150
I know, I know...

694
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,910
If anything's happened to him...

695
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,154
We went by train
but it only stopped at Benesov.

696
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,558
We were delayed
but we delivered the message.

697
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,912
We don't go to Zizkov
by train nor via Benesov!

698
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,711
They're given physical
punishment - you don't mind?

699
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,071
Where's the answer to my letter?
Where is it?

700
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,070
I read it to her over the phone
and she didn't say anything.

701
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,033
She didn't even say thank you.

702
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,710
Separate them in class,

703
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,389
because my son would never
have thought of this.

704
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,830
I'll separate them completely.

705
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,429
D'you know who died?
Vanek, the ice-cream man.

706
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,598
- I didn't know him.
- Yes you did.

707
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,316
The one who rode
that motor-bike.

708
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,953
Him?

709
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:36,515
He was drunk and crashed
into a poplar tree.

710
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,792
- Ice cream, wasps, a mess!
- I'll take one, please.

711
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,238
Your headmaster wouldn't
believe you had it in you!

712
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,028
Praise to Cejka, a born accordion
player, a musical talent.

713
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,357
We'll celebrate the 1st
anniversary of the liberation

714
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,268
not just with song,
but also with drama!

715
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,879
Let it be about
the partisans!

716
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,354
Not only about the partisans but

717
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,990
all those who fought
against the Nazis.

718
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,276
They say he'll be locked up.

719
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:53,079
It's true.
He's been charged.

720
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,115
- What?
- Charged.

721
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,430
With touching girls up.

722
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,835
He's been touching up
the twins.

723
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,270
Mum says he got them
pregnant.

724
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,197
Hi, you cows!

725
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,515
I hear you're pregnant!

726
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,393
- You're an idiot!
- And you're stupid!

727
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,950
Is that basket
for the babies?

728
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:32,319
Let me introduce your new
teacher, Miss Plecita.

729
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,510
We want our teacher!

730
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,118
Mr Hnizdo was dismissed because

731
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:44,153
he used excessive
corporal punishment.

732
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,954
- It's not true!
- Who said so?

733
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,112
Didn't he beat you?

734
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,918
Those who were beaten
come forward.

735
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,670
Rosenheim, didn't he beat you?

736
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,908
No.

737
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,113
I hope you're not lying to me.

738
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,960
Your mother complained to me
that you had swollen hands.

739
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,474
She's talking rubbish.

740
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,436
Which song-birds do you know?

741
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,113
The tit!

742
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,032
Two tits!

743
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,711
Miss...

744
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,390
It's been cleared up.

745
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,277
Truth triumphed, as it
says in our coat of arms.

746
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,079
We kept it quiet about
you beating us.

747
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,158
I know, thank you.

748
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,396
Remember what I told you
about Ancient Rome,

749
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,557
even if it's not
for 11-year-olds.

750
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:01,431
They had a democracy, but
in danger elected a dictator.

751
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:06,274
For us, the danger has ended.

752
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,353
You have proved that
a dictator is redundant.

753
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,196
Who d'you think
will win the election?

754
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,993
I'd say the Communists.

755
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,635
Me, too, that's why
I'm not giving them my vote.

756
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,115
Their plans are not bad...

757
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,749
"We're against collective
farms and any form of

758
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,553
forced collectivization.

759
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,869
The Communists are for trades
and small businesses."

760
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,430
I voted for them before the war
so they'd have more votes -

761
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,997
it's better for democracy
if there's a strong opposition.

762
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,875
Of course.

763
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,232
The ruling party must be afraid
things could turn

764
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,148
and they'll loose their majority
in the next election.

765
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,637
Otherwise they'd be
unbearably arrogant.

766
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,479
They can be tough.

767
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:21,154
We're Slavs, but western Slavs!

768
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,194
Here, no dictatorship
can flourish.

769
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,676
It's not in the spirit
of the nation, not so?

770
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,910
Here we are!

771
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,430
Stop the bus!

772
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,549
Here you see it!

773
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:44,996
These bunkers were built
all along the frontier.

774
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,591
From each one you can see
the other,

775
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:55,277
their lines of fire crossed so
even a mouse couldn't pass.

776
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,073
No cement or iron was spared.

777
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,510
They're so strong that when
the Nazis got hold of them,

778
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,599
and tried to blow them
up - they couldn't!

779
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,829
They even tried to blow one up
in front of Hitler;

780
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,270
the bunker was lifted off
the ground but landed intact!

781
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:20,429
We should've defended ourselves.

782
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,836
How could we
if the Allies betrayed us?

783
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,070
The Russians were ready
to help us.

784
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,671
The Russians?
Hitler drove them back to Moscow.

785
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:36,193
If we'd fought back,
we wouldn't be here.

786
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:40,833
There would've been
so much bloodshed!

787
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,950
I can't see anything!

788
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,235
Guys, where are you?

789
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,278
Here! Come here!

790
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,828
- Where are you?
- We're here!

791
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,549
Who knows what it would've been
like if we'd gone it alone.

792
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,071
I was a civilian,
because of an injury.

793
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:21,633
Served in one of these?
Seem to know it quite well.

794
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,472
In this one.

795
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,914
Then you went to the Western
or Eastern front?

796
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,988
My son tells us such
stories about you.

797
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,511
One wonders
how you managed it all.

798
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:49,553
I want them to have an example.

799
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,597
I understand.

800
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,834
- Come and see what we found!
- It hasn't exploded yet!

801
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,514
Don't touch anything!

802
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,958
Everyone take ten steps back.

803
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,279
This is a very dangerous object.

804
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,515
It's an anti-tank bomb.

805
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,319
A very efficient weapon
of Hitler's.

806
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,714
A bazooka!

807
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,633
Yes, a bazooka.

808
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,639
Defuse it, Sir!

809
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:40,193
If anyone knows how to defuse it,
best get it over with.

810
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,000
Blow it up!

811
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,237
Now you'll see what we do
in cases like this.

812
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,598
Group A - me, you and the driver

813
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,638
goes to the nearest military
headquarters to report it.

814
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,993
Group B - that's Mr Soucek
stays here on guard.

815
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,752
Forward march!

816
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,754
We won't be in Prague by eight.
Their parents'll go mad!

817
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,752
Group A - hit the ground!

818
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,955
You useless idiot!

819
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,158
Pack up your bags and go!

820
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,354
I've never seen anything
like it!

821
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,515
- Hello.
- Hello, lad.

822
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,430
Go and visit him.

823
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,636
He only just escaped death.

824
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,836
For me it'll be any minute.

825
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,553
- Hi.
- What happened?

826
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,477
Hand grenade out of a bottle.

827
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,911
I put some film in it,
lit it and corked it.

828
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,711
It blew up in my hand.

829
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,351
A terrible blast.

830
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,389
Thank God it didn't go
near your eyes!

831
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,476
Look under the bed.

832
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,037
It's yours.
I've lost three fingers.

833
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,718
Let's give it back to Mr Kavka.

834
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:24,196
Remember what happened
with the magician?

835
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,752
I'll keep it, then.

836
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,715
Have you tried discharging?

837
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,308
Sounds pretty hopeless.

838
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:15,314
Wake Modry up
and get the boys out.

839
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,070
I'll be right over.

840
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,674
Do you have to go there?

841
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,035
Yes.

842
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,352
Dad?

843
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,833
Be sure to use that rod.

844
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,916
Go back to sleep.

845
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,950
Are you afraid of the storm?

846
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,277
No, I can't sleep.

847
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,438
You and Dad won't divorce,
will you?

848
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:03,030
What on earth
are you talking about?

849
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,512
Mr Hnizdo
is better-looking

850
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,235
but I wouldn't want
any other Dad.

851
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,671
Who said I want another man?

852
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,519
Where did you get
such nonsense from?

853
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,428
You had your arms round
each other.

854
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,478
- I what?
- You were hugging him.

855
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,750
I saw you.

856
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:35,433
I was worried about you,
I must've huddled up to him.

857
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:43,035
It wasn't an embrace.

858
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,150
Yes, it was.

859
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,238
Poor child!
Your Daddy's been killed!

860
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,158
He was electrocuted!

861
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,439
Where are you going?

862
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,359
- Who's boy is this?
- The Transformer's.

863
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,392
What's up with you?

864
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,110
Mrs Mlejnkova's a complete idiot!

865
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,279
She heard "transformer"
and thought it was Dad!

866
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,511
Has that boy gone mad?

867
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:03,759
FIRST ANNIVERSARY
OF THE LIBERATION

868
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,475
Our programme...

869
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,316
Our programme continues with...

870
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,279
With the play "War is Over,
Peace is Everywhere."

871
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,997
Mr Hnizdo humbly omitted
the fact that

872
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:43,792
he wrote the play himself.

873
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,990
Our boy didn't want
to play a Nazi.

874
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,190
Who crawls out
of his hole?

875
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,278
A Nazi! Out of breath.

876
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,792
Whistle on, Nazi, the Allies
are coming for sure.

877
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:11,438
So rasp and croak away,
the Americans are in Plzen.

878
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,674
The Soviet tanks are just
outside Prague.

879
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,634
Czechs in the British
divisions make haste.

880
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,078
The partisans are firing
from all directions.

881
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,191
Not sweet is your song,
the political prisoners come.

882
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,911
Screech your song of death,
Nazi.

883
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,317
Together the Allies
will crush you.

884
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,031
Where's the one with the
moustache?

885
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,549
War is over,
peace is everywhere!

886
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,589
You were a real soldier
and partisan, weren't you?

887
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:03,508
Or you couldn't have written
so beautifully.

888
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,638
- I will always be a Slav!
- Another time, Lakatos.

889
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,353
Come on!

890
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,676
War is over, peace is
everywhere. Thus we shall behave.

891
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,509
We shall work; some with our
heads, some with our hands,

892
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:25,714
so that our Republic is an
example to the whole world.

893
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:36,117
THE END
