It ' s only three years
since daddy gave you to me!

40
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,091
I ' d just love to take you
on a ride again,

41
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,449
but you know ve mustn' t.

42
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:56,050
Such goings-on,
they ' re expecting the King...

43
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:01,331
I ' II come again
when I ' ve finished my work.

44
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,533
Bailiff!
Are they coming?

45
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:16,411
Not a soul to be seen, madam!

46
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,850
Come and tell me as soon as
they appear below the forest!

47
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,854
Cinderella again, I bet!

48
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,574
You' II be the death of me,
silly fool!

49
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,535
Pick i t up, quick...

50
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:06,452
Who did i t?
The dish was cracked anyway, m ' am...

51
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,209
You' re not answering
my question!

52
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,847
It was I, mother,
please forgive me!

53
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:23,325
Yes, m ' am?
Everything ready?

54
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:27,851
The meat, yes...
Chicken, wine, frui t...

55
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:29,768
Yes, madam, everything.

56
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,892
To please such guests
is qui te a problem.

57
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,007
So see you don' t spoil
anything.

58
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,086
I really don' t know
if you' re so clumsy

59
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:44,815
or if you do i t on purpose.

60
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,294
Some legacy your father left
me in you...

61
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:54,086
Like father like...
You leave daddy alone!

62
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,413
He ' s left you the whole farm,
the forest and the mill

63
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,932
How dare you speak to me
like that!

64
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,205
Did you hear?

65
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,535
Kindly remember:

66
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:12,252
Gone are the times your father
took you to the forest,

67
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:16,086
riding and shooting
like a boy!

68
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:20,172
I am the mistress here now...

69
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,007
And keep away from that horse!

70
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:28,645
Here!

71
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:38,890
Pick them apart by lunch-time
and then come and apologize!

72
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:45,848
I ' II bring you down
a peg or two!

73
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:48,809
And woe betide you
if I catch sight of you

74
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,409
when the King is here!

75
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:54,205
Don' t get all upset,
that ' s just grimy Cinderella!

76
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:06,614
Thanks, Cinderella...
I ' II help you!

77
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,368
And leave me here alone?

78
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:16,812
Well, my girl, a step-mother is
always a step-mother...

79
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,290
But her Dora wasn' t Daddy ' s,
and he loved her!

80
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,888
Dear friends...

81
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,293
The peas onto the basket,
the ashes into the pail...

82
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,689
...how good of you!

83
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,333
Looking for a lick, Pussy?

84
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,326
No, you can' t go in now!

85
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,209
Can you manage than much?

86
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,725
Of cour_rrr_rse you can!

87
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,729
The gentry not arrived yet, Cinderella?

88
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,328
How did you know i t is I?

89
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:04,535
I didn' t, but Jurášek did.
Knows you a mile off...

90
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,855
Why aren' t you watching out
for royalty wi th the others?

91
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,091
I ' m not to...

92
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,408
And I prefer being here anyway.

93
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,611
Not even curious to see the Prince?

94
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,569
I saw him last year...

95
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,135
When they stopped on the way
to the castle.

96
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:24,014
And did you like him?

97
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:27,924
Jurášek is my favouri te...

98
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,245
They ' re coming!

99
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:31,851
Here they are!

100
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,894
Be good, children!

101
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,175
Everything all right, Dora dear?
Mind you show me the Prince!

102
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,373
Where are you off to, Silly-Billy?

103
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,574
You li ttle poacher!

104
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:28,965
Go and welcome the King!

105
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,051
You know ve can' t go hunting any more!

106
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:36,846
Jurášek and I ' II be right
back, sorun along!

107
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:50,691
Rosie!

108
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,688
Looking after my treasures?!

109
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,774
Jurášek is calling me...

110
00:13:43,216 --> 00:13:44,934
We have so li ttle time, you see!

111
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,850
Quickly...
Bow low, and don' t forget-smile!

112
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,415
All the time!

113
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:17,211
Where is the Prince, tutor?
And Kamil and Ví tek?

114
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:19,291
I don' t know, your Highness.

115
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:22,050
I was giving them a lecture
on elegant manners,

116
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:25,412
and in the forest
the gentleman disappeared...

117
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,367
Find them!
A strict reprimand!

118
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,613
No, l"ll see to that myself!

119
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,044
Wai t!

120
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,211
But you' re such
a renowned shot, Prince?!

121
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:13,650
Look...

122
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,415
Follow her...

123
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:49,645
This way...

124
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:28,769
Where ' s the trail?

125
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,651
There!

126
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,288
Highness, you from the left,
and you from the right!

127
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,175
Look, we ' ve got her!

128
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,131
Is that her?
There ' s none other here!

129
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:25,087
This is just a bi t of a girl!

130
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,047
A mere kid!

131
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:30,605
A fluffy chicken...

132
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,535
A purring ki tten...

133
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:42,210
But I say, It ' s got claws!

134
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,014
Need a spanking, if you ask me!

135
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,290
Or whipping wi th a nettle!

136
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:50,324
When the cows come home
...ni twi ts!

137
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,606
I say... now we ' II show you,
you cheeky kid!

138
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:06,013
You' d fight a bi t of a girl?
You, such a he-man?!

139
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,569
What are you up to?

140
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:17,933
Jump off, he ' II throw you!

141
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:22,252
She ' II break her neck!
She ' II come to a bad end.

142
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,133
Even your stable-boy ' s
scared of your Dapples!

143
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:26,048
Crazy girl...

144
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,929
We must find her...

145
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:41,053
Go back to your master!

146
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,607
He obeyed like a lamb!
The wildcat!

147
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,130
She ' d deserve...
A medal, gentlemen!

148
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,293
For putting one over on us!

149
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,375
Your Highness...

150
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,966
Don' t do this to me!

151
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:16,094
Your studies, Highness!

152
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:28,454
I can hardly express
how we looked forward

153
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:31,334
to your coming -
and her Highness the Queen

154
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:33,413
and also his Highness, the Prince...

155
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,851
and the whole entourage, and so on.

156
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,130
We thank you.

157
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,805
Dear Dora her could hardly sleep...

158
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:44,686
The Prince is not wi th you this time?

159
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:47,124
Oh yes...

160
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:52,407
Nature studies have detained
him on the way...

161
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:54,685
Pi ty...

162
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,648
All year we looked forward

163
00:21:56,856 --> 00:22:00,451
to your stopping here
on the way to the castle.

164
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,608
I even had a dream...

165
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:05,614
that your royal Highness
invi ted us to the ball...

166
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:08,125
Dora and myself...

167
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,215
That your Highness smiled
at Dora and said:

168
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:16,130
Do come, my dear,
we shall be pleased to see you.

169
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:21,694
We shall be pleased to see you.

170
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:23,245
Our pleasure...

171
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,495
Thank you for the refreshment.

172
00:22:27,256 --> 00:22:29,292
Yes, yes...
On our way!

173
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:38,651
This is an inexpressible honour for us!

174
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,374
That ' s in the bag...
And who knows, amongst all

175
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:52,095
those noblemen
someone might notice you...

176
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:57,171
Maybe even the Prince himself!
Why not?

177
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,132
Carrying on like a li ttle boy!

178
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,889
At your age I was...

179
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,251
...carrying the burdens
of a ruler!

180
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,691
You' II come down a peg or two
when we get you married!

181
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,046
That ' s tamed other rebels!

182
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:55,766
I honour your experience...

183
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:02,133
Hadn' t we better talk this over at home?

184
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:08,090
I hoped you would devote yourselves

185
00:24:08,176 --> 00:24:10,974
to the study of diplomacy and
court etiquette...

186
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:15,647
We try not to waste a minute!

187
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:20,845
But studies are a demanding business!

188
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:26,088
Where have you left your tutor?

189
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,254
He must have wandered off again...

190
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,088
The frivolous...

191
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,769
Stop!

192
00:24:41,336 --> 00:24:44,169
Are those just threats
or does he really want me to marry?

193
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:48,409
This time he really means i t.

194
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:32,125
A roll of fine line, gold thread,
velvet, thirty ells, in dark blue...

195
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,973
I don' t want velvet,
I want satin!

196
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,409
The velvet is for me, Dora.

197
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:42,734
And forty ells of the best
satin in sky blue.

198
00:25:42,816 --> 00:25:45,489
That ' s not enough.
Get fifty, then.

199
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:51,410
Oh, and wide gold braid.

200
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,367
And silver buckles for my
slippers!

201
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:55,651
Tell the dressmaker you' II
fetch her day after tomorrow.

202
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,364
Don' t forget anything!

203
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,605
Yes... no...

204
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:40,135
Cinderella, you' II freeze!

205
00:26:40,856 --> 00:26:42,335
Did the mistress make you...

206
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,365
Who else?

207
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:49,413
And what shall I get you in town?

208
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:52,286
A tiara and pearls and
a robe wi th a train!

209
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:56,967
I can just see them both persuading me
to go to the ball wi th them...

210
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,088
Surely you wouldn' t cry for that...

211
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:05,211
If I could, I ' d bring you
whatever you wished...

212
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:06,895
Honestly, I would...

213
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:12,093
Well then bring me the first thing,
that hi ts you on the nose!

214
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,215
All right, then!

215
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,811
The Lady at Žemlov accepted
our invi tation?

216
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:50,247
Indeed, the messenger has just arrived!

217
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,896
And the Princess of Rožmberk?

218
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:58,048
Defini tely coming wi th both daughters,
Miss Liza and Miss Loulou.

219
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:00,612
The younger one ' s
at least thirty!

220
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,087
She is a year younger
than you, and very sweet!

221
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,685
Which you are not!

222
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,854
And the Baron' s widow
from Krásná H rka?
_

223
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,489
She promised to bring
all three daughters.

224
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:19,454
I thought It was to be a ball,
but this looks more like a man-hunt!

225
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:21,572
Your impertinence is unseemly!

226
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,852
I apologize for my frankness,
but I was brought up to speak

227
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,574
the truth.
May I leave?

228
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,451
You' II first hear me out!

229
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:39,454
I had no idea the family
council would take so long.

230
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:42,733
The tutor and my friends
are wai ting,

231
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,535
may I dismiss them?

232
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,886
What was so important...?

233
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:54,485
We were to study history...
then I was to have suffered

234
00:28:55,416 --> 00:29:00,365
a lesson in etiquette and
wi tty conversation...

235
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,248
History? Conversation?

236
00:29:06,936 --> 00:29:08,494
Aren' t you shooting fun of me?

237
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:13,290
Shoot-fun-how could I?

238
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:15,495
Here you are...

239
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,088
Horses away...!

240
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:30,567
Why the cross-bows, then?

241
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:34,175
Call that study?

242
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:37,252
Of course he doesn' t want to
marry,

243
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,725
fooling round on a horse
all day wi th cross bows!

244
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:42,370
Horse and cross-bows?
How' s that?

245
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:44,575
Come and see!

246
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:53,366
Gentlemen, I ' m responsible
for you,

247
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:56,687
your studies,
state interests

248
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,209
I don' t understand...

249
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,972
Don' t forget to practice
dance-steps,

250
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,047
so you don' t
cut a sorry figure!

251
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:13,728
Remember, I at your age...

252
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:15,807
...danced through three pairs
of slippers at a ball!

253
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,131
Really?

254
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:19,888
Before we mer, of course...

255
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:25,093
But you apologized that
i t was the first time

256
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:28,612
you were dancing,
when you trod on my feet.

257
00:30:29,936 --> 00:30:32,496
That is nothing to brag of to a son...

258
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:38,365
My dear, he takes after you...
in all the important things!

259
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:41,934
No!
Yes!

260
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,809
After the dancing lesson,
some conversation!

261
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:00,170
Ah, conversation...

262
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:05,771
Your Highness,

263
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,246
I have decided, that you will ask for
my hand in marriage.

264
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:09,611
Do you agree?

265
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,886
No, my beautiful Countess.

266
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,048
I honour your ancien family
and your great beauty,

267
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:18,885
but my heart belongs forever
to hunting, shooting and riding.

268
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,012
So the wedding-is no go.

269
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:29,251
Or as the poet says:
No rain from that cloud!

270
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,893
Or as that kid said:
When the cows come home!

271
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:36,131
Look...

272
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,852
Gentlemen!

273
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,295
We ' re off!

274
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,127
What about your studies?!

275
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:28,214
My dear girl,
I nearly forgot!

276
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:39,775
Like a spider ' s web...

277
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:45,771
Stand back...
turn round!

278
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:51,252
And you hurry!

279
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:05,728
Look, Cinderella,
they hi t the tip of my nose

280
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:08,126
just as I dreamt
I was off to your wedding...

281
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:10,251
What did you give her?

282
00:34:11,336 --> 00:34:13,213
Show me!

283
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:22,093
Some present!
For a squirrel!

284
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:33,614
The bodice...

285
00:34:34,256 --> 00:34:37,373
Mummy, you forgot the lace!

286
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:40,045
And a new necklace!
And rings!

287
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:46,165
Mumy, you can' t send
a man-servant for jewellery!

288
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:47,891
That ' s true...

289
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:49,967
We ' II go to town ourselves.
Yes, M' am.

290
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,730
Have the horse put to
the buggy!

291
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:59,770
Would you like to come to
town wi th us, Cinderella?

292
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:03,407
You' d only scare people off!

293
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,410
Stop staring!
Sveep up properly!

294
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:16,528
I said properly, understand?

295
00:35:24,336 --> 00:35:25,485
Stop that at once!

296
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:26,528
Be a good boy...

297
00:36:29,976 --> 00:36:31,455
Wai t here, I ' II go and see Rosie...

298
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:51,095
You lucky thing,
flying where you want to...

299
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:58,172
I ' d so like to see where he goes...

300
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:02,415
But how can I, like this?

301
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:05,375
All this is mine?

302
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,292
Don' t be afraid of me!
This was all inside the nut!

303
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,888
Ho do I look, Silly-Billy?

304
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,614
The first shot!

305
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:07,095
There, now a bird of prey

306
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:09,811
and your Highness is
the King of the Hunt!

307
00:40:27,896 --> 00:40:34,369
The King awards this
precious ring

308
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:37,171
to the huntsman who first
shoots down a bird of prey!

309
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:14,771
First shot!

310
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:15,811
Second shot!
Third!

311
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,364
Your turn, Prince!

312
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:42,490
Too high

313
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:01,651
Whose arrow is ti?

314
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:14,891
Highness!

315
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:25,965
Forgive me...

316
00:42:32,056 --> 00:42:33,011
Who are you?

317
00:42:34,456 --> 00:42:36,412
I thought you do not want to fire...!

318
00:42:41,256 --> 00:42:42,689
Qui te an ordinary one.

319
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:45,376
Do we continue wi th the hunt?

320
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:49,092
The best marksman has shown
us his art -

321
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:50,811
the ring!

322
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:00,011
It is yours by rights!

323
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:11,413
Or can you do better still?

324
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:14,608
I am sorry that you are cross...

325
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,775
Do you see those cones at the tip?

326
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,090
Would you dare?

327
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,653
Here any bi t of a girl can do that.

328
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,410
My horse!

329
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:42,726
Did a young hunter go this way?

330
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:44,331
Why?

331
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,135
Did he or did he not?

332
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:51,450
No, far and wide nothing but
a fluffy ki tten,

333
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,171
a cheeky kid!

334
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:55,966
Come on down!
You come up!

335
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:09,288
We ' ve met before, haven' t we?

336
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,653
You' d have to remind me where!

337
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,655
Here in the wood, you li ttle lizzard!

338
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:15,689
You won' t escape today!

339
00:45:21,256 --> 00:45:22,974
Where is he?
Where?

340
00:45:23,176 --> 00:45:24,609
She ' II tell us!

341
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,728
Where ' s she gone to?

342
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:31,851
Who?

343
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:35,049
That bi t of a girl,
I was talking to her just now...

344
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,128
Pass the buttons, Cinderella!

345
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:55,094
Cinderella, the silver thread!

346
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:00,649
Cinderella, the necklace!

347
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:08,934
Come on!

348
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:13,329
I want the carpet out,
right up to the sleigh!

349
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:14,371
Yes, m ' am.

350
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:22,690
Well?
Lovely...

351
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:25,610
Just beautiful, Dora dear...

352
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:27,335
My hat!

353
00:46:28,656 --> 00:46:30,931
Would you like to come
wi th us to the ball?

354
00:46:32,136 --> 00:46:33,489
Say, would you?

355
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:36,807
I know you wouldn' t take me inside.

356
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:40,485
But could I just have a peep...
through the window?

357
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:45,814
And who ' II do the cleaning here?

358
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:48,567
I ' d get i t all done by morning.

359
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:54,768
If you haven' t enough to do
...there!

360
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:06,650
I want i t all gone
when we ' re back!

361
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:10,811
The lentils picked
from the corn!

362
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:24,891
I ' II tell you

363
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,933
how many times I danced
wi th the Prince!

364
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:28,251
Hold my train!

365
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,535
You' d better hold i t yourself.
I could soil i t.

366
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:05,295
Don' t be sad,
I ' II dance wi th you after supper.

367
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:17,527
You go and get us something to eat!

368
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:19,494
Your word is my command, Highness!

369
00:48:23,896 --> 00:48:27,650
You' re sorry you can' t go, aren' t you?
I know...

370
00:48:29,816 --> 00:48:31,772
But I can' t help you.

371
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,455
It ' II take me a week to pick
these apart...

372
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:13,004
...you' ve come to help me?

373
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:17,530
The corn into the basket,
lentils into the bowl!

374
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:24,052
What would I have done wi thout you.

375
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,171
Thank you!

376
00:49:46,136 --> 00:49:47,569
Daddy always laughed that

377
00:49:47,656 --> 00:49:50,216
I ' d ride to my first ball
on Jurášek, like a Hussar.

378
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,688
And my mummy promised me
a pretty dress,

379
00:49:56,776 --> 00:49:59,495
as pink as
the red evening sky...

380
00:50:02,216 --> 00:50:04,446
And all that ' s left to me is
Jurášek...

381
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:12,610
No, I have lots of other things...

382
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:17,329
three magic hazel-nuts...
no, only two...

383
00:50:21,696 --> 00:50:23,175
Rosie, do you think...?

384
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:11,686
How did you get here,
and who saddled you?

385
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:22,688
The noble Lady of the Black
Forest, wi th daughter...

386
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,095
Baroness of Shortwood
wi th grand-daughter...

387
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:32,533
Lady of Žemlov
wi th daughters...

388
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:42,649
Don' t look so sour!
Smile!

389
00:51:47,576 --> 00:51:50,010
I ' d like to know which one
you' d be smiling at,

390
00:51:50,096 --> 00:51:51,575
if you had to marry her.

391
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,171
Dad, let ' s postpone i t for a year...

392
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:59,651
Listen to him!
And this is to be my successor!

393
00:51:59,736 --> 00:52:02,375
Do choose a more convenient
time for quarrelling!

394
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:12,971
Did you notice how he smiled at you?

395
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:19,491
I made no such fuss
when I got married!

396
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:23,445
But you married mummy...
and you force strange girls onto me...

397
00:52:31,656 --> 00:52:34,489
The noble Lady of Gotham wi th niece...

398
00:52:34,656 --> 00:52:37,568
You' d better give rein
to your temperament on the dance-floor.

399
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,248
I don' t care,
you point to one, I ' II ask her...

400
00:52:47,816 --> 00:52:52,685
His Highness now asks you
to start the dance.

401
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,485
Music!

402
00:53:08,616 --> 00:53:10,527
Come on, that ' s impoli te!

403
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,456
Look, that pretty blonde
wi th the blue train...

404
00:53:14,616 --> 00:53:16,607
Or the brunette in yellow...

405
00:53:19,856 --> 00:53:21,335
How can I choose!

406
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:23,649
I ' II choose blindly!

407
00:54:09,136 --> 00:54:11,809
Clumsy girl, you' re so slow!

408
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,535
May I have the pleasure?

409
00:54:45,136 --> 00:54:49,687
I knew nothing of
the Prince ' s taste, i t seems.

410
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:56,725
Li ttle bird,
where is your nest?

411
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:03,965
Beware of traps
where you rest...

412
00:55:22,256 --> 00:55:27,205
Lean down, dear whi te birch,

413
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:35,005
enfold the scared li ttle bird,

414
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:42,005
so I can go in peace...

415
00:57:10,856 --> 00:57:12,335
Did you come from afar?

416
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,293
The distance was no greater

417
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,129
than my longing to dance
wi th your Highness!

418
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,646
In spi te of my treading
on your toes?

419
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:23,325
That is an hour for me, Highness.

420
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:26,336
I would dance wi th you
till the end of the world.

421
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,215
What courage!

422
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,493
I can land you as much as you like!

423
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:34,575
I don' t make debts, young lady!

424
00:58:02,536 --> 00:58:04,492
You think I should go in?

425
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:15,125
Shall I, shall I not,
shall I, shall I not...

426
00:58:15,456 --> 00:58:16,889
I shall...

427
00:58:18,976 --> 00:58:20,455
Well, I ' II give i t a try...

428
00:58:31,016 --> 00:58:32,734
Don' t be cross, I ' m going!

429
00:59:32,176 --> 00:59:34,167
Mind out!

430
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:48,805
Have pi ty on him!
Let him stew a bi t.

431
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:27,448
Out of breath?

432
01:00:27,576 --> 01:00:29,089
I ' II have them play something faster.

433
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,287
Have them play what you like!
I ' ve finished dancing!

434
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:47,929
Go back and dance!
I ' d rather fell trees!

435
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:50,333
All right, start at once!

436
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,295
As you like!

437
01:00:57,136 --> 01:00:58,615
Good evening, your Highness!

438
01:01:00,496 --> 01:01:02,407
Thank you for a wonderful welcome!

439
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:05,415
I... you see...

440
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,252
I ' m sorry, you surprised me...

441
01:01:09,296 --> 01:01:11,093
I thought you were
running out to meet me...

442
01:01:11,656 --> 01:01:13,726
No, I was just running out...

443
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,213
In that case I shan' t keep you...

444
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,455
But I don' t want to any longer...

445
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:23,175
May I have the pleasure?

446
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:26,169
Wouldn' t i t go better wi th music?

447
01:01:28,536 --> 01:01:30,208
Why aren' t they playing?

448
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:51,769
Who are you?

449
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:55,486
Do you want to question me,
or to dance?

450
01:02:00,696 --> 01:02:02,175
Who can i t be?

451
01:02:03,856 --> 01:02:05,335
Maybe she ' II tall...

452
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:08,452
Our boy forgot all about
the trees he wanted to fell!

453
01:02:08,536 --> 01:02:10,094
Look how graceful she is!

454
01:02:10,736 --> 01:02:12,294
Shall I ask her up?

455
01:02:12,856 --> 01:02:15,734
Let her dance a while...
Wi th that clumsy boy of ours?

456
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:17,729
You may be surprised!

457
01:02:22,976 --> 01:02:25,809
Do you know who i t is?
I don' t...

458
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:39,692
Why doesn' t she take that veil off?
Probably hiding a big nose!

459
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,167
Take off that veil, then!

460
01:03:10,216 --> 01:03:12,286
Is this my son?

461
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,769
He is only doing what you asked...

462
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:16,654
But who is she?

463
01:03:17,936 --> 01:03:19,972
You are more impatient than your son.

464
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:40,849
At least give me a hint!

465
01:03:42,976 --> 01:03:44,614
Why do you want to know?

466
01:03:48,016 --> 01:03:50,325
Because I have just chosen a bride
and I know not who she is...

467
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:53,533
Not so loud, they are listening!
Let them hear!

468
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:55,294
I ' II call right out into the world...

469
01:03:55,656 --> 01:04:00,571
that I ' m in love...
and getting married...!

470
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,728
But you forgot something!
What?

471
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,372
To ask the bride if she wants you!

472
01:04:07,496 --> 01:04:08,929
You' d give me the mi tten?

473
01:04:10,496 --> 01:04:12,487
A bi t of cheek, what?

474
01:04:17,056 --> 01:04:19,445
Will you have me, or not?

475
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:23,245
I ' II give you a riddle,
and if you guess...

476
01:04:24,136 --> 01:04:27,446
First time: Face smuged wi th ashes,
but i t ' s no huntsman?

477
01:04:38,136 --> 01:04:42,687
What on earth...
Calm down, you' II find out...

478
01:04:43,896 --> 01:04:46,046
Third time:

479
01:04:46,336 --> 01:04:51,615
A dress embroidered in silver,
but she ' s not a Princess!

480
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:54,808
Well, that...

481
01:04:58,616 --> 01:05:00,129
Pi ty...

482
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:04,209
Until you know the answer
to my riddle -

483
01:05:05,016 --> 01:05:06,495
Goodbye!

484
01:05:19,856 --> 01:05:22,086
What happened?
Why did she run off?

485
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:47,688
What if he ' s fallen in love?

486
01:05:48,256 --> 01:05:51,532
That was your wish.
Wi thout my permission?

487
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:53,849
I ' d like to see that!

488
01:05:53,976 --> 01:05:58,925
You didn' t obey your parents ei ther,
and brought me home, my love...

489
01:06:00,616 --> 01:06:03,369
Why aren' t they playing?
Play!

490
01:06:03,496 --> 01:06:04,975
Music, please!

491
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:55,295
Get the horses, quickly!

492
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:31,615
Open up!

493
01:08:39,296 --> 01:08:41,093
Come on, open up!

494
01:08:42,896 --> 01:08:45,569
What ' s wrong?
Open up!

495
01:09:05,296 --> 01:09:06,729
We have not come in enmi ty...

496
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,255
Why, then?

497
01:09:10,936 --> 01:09:14,212
Who is the master of this house?
No master-a mistress!

498
01:09:14,296 --> 01:09:16,810
But she ' s at the Palace ball
wi th her daughter!

499
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:20,734
Staring like an owl -
let him say what he wants!

500
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:22,969
That beautiful Princess!

501
01:09:23,336 --> 01:09:25,133
Princess?
Here?

502
01:09:27,016 --> 01:09:28,574
She rode in a moment before me!

503
01:09:29,616 --> 01:09:31,572
Let him find his Princess, then!

504
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,486
I don' t know if she ' s a Princess,
but she is beautiful...

505
01:09:40,136 --> 01:09:41,694
and somewhere here I lost her!

506
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:47,205
We have droves of beauties here Sir!

507
01:09:47,576 --> 01:09:49,009
Just to choose the right one!

508
01:09:49,256 --> 01:09:50,928
Come and make your choice,
you tenderfoot!

509
01:09:51,016 --> 01:09:53,166
Or get out of here!

510
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,816
That ' s not bad advice, your Highness!
Let ' s wai t till daybreak!

511
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:58,808
Mornings make for wiser decisions!
What now-at night!

512
01:09:58,896 --> 01:10:01,285
No, I must find her!

513
01:10:02,096 --> 01:10:05,008
I want to see all the girls
of this farmstead!

514
01:10:05,136 --> 01:10:07,889
By what right, Sir?

515
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:13,571
It ' s the Prince!
Oh, the Prince... Your Highness...

516
01:10:14,456 --> 01:10:16,412
Every single girl!

517
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:18,930
Here they are, your Highness!

518
01:10:22,776 --> 01:10:25,006
Now I wonder what you' II do!

519
01:10:25,216 --> 01:10:27,605
She had a veil...
...a rose-pink dress!

520
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:32,174
Stop!

521
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:36,686
What ' s he doing here?
Looking for someone.

522
01:10:54,496 --> 01:10:57,488
...you don' t know her face...
...nor her name...

523
01:10:59,896 --> 01:11:01,488
I ' II recognize her by the slipper...

524
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:04,654
The girl whom this slipper fi ts
will be my wife!

525
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:06,891
Your foot!

526
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:12,849
Next!

527
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,534
That ' s too small even for a doll...

528
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:29,208
Leave off, you silly fool!

529
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:32,769
Have they all tried i t on?

530
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:36,815
There ' s one more here!
You dupe...

531
01:11:38,976 --> 01:11:40,568
Is there really no one other here?

532
01:11:41,656 --> 01:11:44,124
Of course there is,
your Highness - Cinderella!

533
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:48,414
Yes, Cinderella!

534
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:50,970
Why hasn' t she shown up?
Where can she be?

535
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,092
I haven' t seen her all evening!
Cinderella!

536
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,609
She had to pick the corn
from the lentils!

537
01:11:54,696 --> 01:11:57,085
We must find her!
Cinderella!

538
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:08,895
Come!
Wai t here!

539
01:12:23,176 --> 01:12:24,609
Take that rope!
What for?

540
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:37,767
Do you think she ' s in there?

541
01:12:43,296 --> 01:12:45,287
Ah, here you are!

542
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:51,931
Cinderella!

543
01:12:55,656 --> 01:12:57,135
She isn' t here, ei ther...

544
01:13:03,656 --> 01:13:05,135
Cinderella!

545
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:10,808
Cinderella, where are you?!

546
01:13:30,616 --> 01:13:32,686
Unsaddle him and rub him down!

547
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,851
Your Highness!

548
01:13:52,056 --> 01:13:53,011
Halt!

549
01:13:56,256 --> 01:13:59,248
So i t wasn' t a vain search!
I shan' t let you go now!

550
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:00,894
Why did you come here?

551
01:14:01,296 --> 01:14:04,049
To find her!
Why did you search for her?

552
01:14:04,456 --> 01:14:05,889
To ask her to marry me!

553
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:07,967
What prevents you from doing so?

554
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:10,495
Unveil her face!

555
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,771
Why?
So I know her!

556
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,331
She is dressed just as at the ball...
the dress, tiara, veil...

557
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:18,647
Why does she not speak?
After you put a ring on her finger!

558
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:20,809
Let her try the slipper on!

559
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:25,135
Let her try the slipper!

560
01:14:26,816 --> 01:14:29,250
Why won' t she try on
her own slipper?

561
01:14:30,576 --> 01:14:34,091
She is shy!

562
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:36,455
Do you want to marry her or not?

563
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:38,969
After she ' s tried on the slipper!

564
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:43,689
Drive off!

565
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:21,165
He ' II follow us, you' II see.
In the end he ' II do as I want!

566
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:16,766
Help me!

567
01:16:17,296 --> 01:16:19,810
Catch hold of my hand...

568
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,888
You are not my bride!

569
01:17:06,256 --> 01:17:08,611
Help me out, Bailiff...

570
01:17:08,816 --> 01:17:13,173
This will be my...
I ' m coming, m ' am!

571
01:17:15,896 --> 01:17:18,126
Do you see anything?
There ' s something in there...

572
01:17:19,296 --> 01:17:22,333
She can' t have disappeared...

573
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:35,246
Do you hear...?

574
01:17:37,816 --> 01:17:39,295
Cinderella!

575
01:17:50,576 --> 01:17:52,009
Rosie, where have you been?

576
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:14,575
But this is the last one...

577
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:37,245
But this is... a wedding dress...

578
01:18:58,216 --> 01:18:59,649
Well?

579
01:19:04,576 --> 01:19:08,091
We should go back...
They ' II be worried at the palace...

580
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:24,252
Your Highness, look!

581
01:19:29,136 --> 01:19:30,569
That is she!

582
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:33,252
Go on, then...
Go on!

583
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:41,454
Have you brought my slipper?

584
01:19:45,376 --> 01:19:48,095
I should return the ring
for the King of the Hunt...

585
01:19:50,336 --> 01:19:51,894
But i t belongs to you!

586
01:19:55,496 --> 01:19:57,964
So now you know the answer
to my riddle?

587
01:19:58,896 --> 01:20:01,854
Face smudged wi th ashes,
but i t ' s no chimney-sweep?

588
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:07,129
That day in the wood,
that bi t of a girl!

589
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:12,249
Hat wi th a feather
and cross-bow, but i t ' s not hunstman?

590
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:15,325
That li ttle sharpshooter
was you, too!

591
01:20:17,216 --> 01:20:21,129
Dress embroidered in silver,
but she ' s no Princess

592
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,615
who is i t?

593
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:27,535
Our Cinderella!
Our Cinderella!

594
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:32,650
And mine, too...
If you want me?

595
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:42,132
And there ' II be a wedding...

596
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:50,365
Li ttle bird, where is your nest?
Where is your nest?

597
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:57,005
Beware of traps
where you rest...

598
01:21:14,056 --> 01:21:18,334
Lean down, dear whi te birch,

599
01:21:22,056 --> 01:21:27,005

600
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:32,765
so I can go in peace...

601
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:44,289
Your Highness,
history lesson is about to begin!

602
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:48,255
Li ttle bird, where is your nest?

603
01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:54,125
Where tonight will you rest?

604
01:21:56,776 --> 01:22:01,725
When snow covers the fields, my maid -

605
01:22:03,096 --> 01:22:08,045
alone I would be afraid!

606
01:22:10,696 --> 01:22:15,645
Lean down, dear whi te birch,

607
01:22:17,696 --> 01:22:22,645
enfold the li ttle bird,

608

609
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:55,365
The End
