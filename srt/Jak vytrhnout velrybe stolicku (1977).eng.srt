¤ HOW TO PULL A WHALE'S TOOTH ¤

2
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:50,551
Vasek, why is there a bandage around the whale's head?

3
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:55,684
Because she's got a toothache!

4
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:14,985
What's up, boys? Don't you want me to give you a lift?

5
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:15,782
Yes!

6
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:17,805
You know him?

7
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,188
Of course. He's my daddy!

8
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:22,010
And which one?

9
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:24,419
A spare one.

10
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,084
That's impossible. My mom says that every primo man is already married.

11
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,575
You have to know how to search!

12
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,453
Well, just like my mom!

13
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,809
I just wore a tie, introduced myself as a minister,...

14
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,969
we had steaks, Pilsner beer, and now we're friends.

15
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:00,743
When I grow up, I'll also deliver milk!

16
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,364
I'll also work like my dad.

17
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,879
A climber!

18
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:16,659
You are already here?

19
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,401
Yes.

20
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:20,762
I'll examine the exercise books at home,...

21
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,659
he'll get new pajamas...

22
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,299
and make him turn the lights off at 8.

23
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,523
And Carla, no chocolate!

24
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,039
Aniczka, and what about dinner?

25
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm going to make it by myself.

26
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,894
Vasek! Vasíczek!

27
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,839
I know that you're at home.

28
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:43,310
Wow! Somebody washed the dishes here.

29
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,413
Somebody probably wants an ice cream as a reward.

30
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,889
My darling!

31
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,328
So where is my nice little boy?

32
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,559
Boo!

33
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:58,605
What's that?

34
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,347
It's a dog.

35
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,347
What did you promise to me? That you'll leave all the strange dogs alone.

36
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,788
It's not a strange dog. It's Arnold!

37
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,029
He's able to get the dust out of the duster.

38
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:07,771
Oh please...

39
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,000
He followed me home. Can I keep him?

40
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,537
And who would take care of him?

41
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:16,845
You'll take him to Valenta's in the evening? And at night Carla will go with him, won't she?

42
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:22,708
If my dad was here, neither me nor the dog would have to go to Valenta's.

43
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:26,281
You just determined you're going to make me upset.

44
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:30,274
Didn't you promise to me that you wouldn't talk about it?

45
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:32,325
I'd also like to have a friend.

46
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,349
You'll get a dog. A nicer one.

47
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,174
But when you are older.

48
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,914
He's nice. He is friends with children.

49
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,572
He catches the second league.

50
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:43,931
Who? The dog?

51
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,693
No. His master. He's primo.

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,797
A goalkeeper.

53
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,133
Please, what are you talking about? Which goalkeeper?

54
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,907
Our school caretaker. You're definitely going to like him!

55
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,547
Why would I be supposed to like him?

56
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,157
Because he's not married.

57
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:04,463
Listen to me: you'll return that dog immediately and I don't want to hear a word about marriage.

58
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:21,444
Damn it, I'm going to have a bruise again!

59
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:27,623
Paris is a boor. But Julie should be gentle.

60
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:32,173
But it wasn't Paris, but that idiot Romeo.

61
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,215
Thanks.

62
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,835
On Sunday again.

63
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,160
The third time this month.

64
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,901
When the troupe from Warsaw comes, you're going to have holiday for a whole week!

65
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,335
And what about rehearsals?

66
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,957
Don't you really want to go somewhere to have a dinner?

67
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,848
Vasek decided that we need somebody at home.

68
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,679
How so? You explained it to him.

69
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,372
I thought it was over.

70
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:44,879
It was. Until his friend's mother got remarried.

71
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:52,387
Vasek's going to get over it. When he's older, he'll have other problems.

72
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:56,522
What if he doesn't get over it?

73
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:03,879
I hope you're not going to blame me. After four years.

74
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,766
You can't let Vasek talk into your private business.

75
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,397
I've already forbidden him to talk about marriage.

76
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,707
That's right.

77
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,214
It's even worse.

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,764
Yesterday he put the third bowl with a toothbrush on the shelf in the bathroom.

79
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,577
You overreact to everything.

80
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,747
I'll wait for you, shouldn't I?

81
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,043
I told you: it's not possible.

82
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,450
Vasek is at Valenta's?

83
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,563
No, Carla is at our place.

84
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,574
The last you had free time was 10 days ago.

85
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:07,615
If you want to, come upstairs.

86
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,629
You are really able to make it easier for me...

87
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,078
I have some free time next Sunday.

88
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:36,629
We'll go to the cinema to watch funnies. Do you want to?

89
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:40,643
Or you can invite Standa over and you can play with cars.

90
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:45,125
Standa can't come now. Now he drives around with his new daddy with milk.

91
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,168
He's got rabbits! And also a new grandpa.

92
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:52,528
Mommy... I'd also like a grandpa. At least one.

93
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:55,224
Tell me rather, where you were yesterday when you pulled your trousers apart.

94
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,088
I was tracking.

95
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,123
A dog again?

96
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,774
No, a sports teacher.

97
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,413
Vasek?!

98
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm detective Colombo. He's not married!

99
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:13,165
You know what, Colombo? I'll really give you a few slaps!

100
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,321
I'd take it. It's worth it if we become three again!

101
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,872
Look, Vasík.

102
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:24,379
If you put away your toothbrush by yourself and you ask for something reasonable, I'll give it to you, all right?

103
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,119
Come on.

104
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:30,016
All right.

105
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,513
You'll take me to the mountains. These holidays.

106
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,933
Couldn't you wish something better? What about seaside in summer?

107
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:41,119
Why don't you ever want to go to the mountains? Because dad was a climber?

108
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,742
Because the theater doesn't have a winter holiday.

109
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,412
You'll make them, then.

110
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:47,394
You will arrange it?

111
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:48,164
Of course!

112
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,292
And how, please?

113
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:50,541
Look!

114
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,854
You're my darling!

115
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,331
Can you ski?

116
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:11,564
I'm not allowed to ski. What if I broke a leg?

117
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,701
Eat! We'll talk about it later.

118
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:19,439
Don't be afraid, Mommy. I won't get killed like my dad.

119
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:27,685
Everybody's going to the mountains! All the boys have dads, but I don't have even a dog!

120
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,236
"My mommy."

121
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:38,012
So, children. Before we start writing, we'll think about our mommies.

122
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,542
What she's like, what she does, what she looks like...

123
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,674
~ And what if both of them come?
~ Doesn't matter, there were six of them in our place.

124
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,746
~ At one moment?!
~ No, one after another.

125
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:57,368
Benda, Martinec. Put your exercise books on the table, you'll take an exercise paper and you'll rewrite the essay after the lessons.

126
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:02,751
Please, comrade teacher, I can't do it today. I have to cook dinner.

127
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,140
Vasek, don't clown around. Sit down!

128
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:08,026
Talk, children, what is your mommy like?

129
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,095
Nice.

130
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,923
Nice eyes.

131
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,584
Curly-haired.

132
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,111
Truthful.

133
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,068
Vasek!

134
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:19,124
I'm already putting it down in writing!

135
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:54,695
One, two, one, two,...and step...one, two,...one, two, three...one, two, three, four...

136
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:18,644
Spartacus is the greatest man of antiquity and the role of Friga is a great chance for you.

137
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,174
It's getting dark, they are both free.

138
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:23,956
Get ready.

139
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,607
And go.

140
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,516
Everything is in the music, so listen to it.

141
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,467
You are happy.

142
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,755
This is useless...I can't work like this!

143
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,361
I got up at 6 o'clock.

144
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,340
How many opportunities do you think you are going to have?

145
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,745
You're going to be retired before someone writes another ballet!

146
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,027
Everybody can arrange it.

147
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:56,019
~ Everybody else has a grandma.
~ What about your mother?

148
00:12:56,627 --> 00:13:00,353
You know her. She thinks that if she left for a few days,
the hospital would collapse.

149
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,829
So you want to travel...?

150
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:14,671
That week in February, when the school holidays are, I don't have performances, I thought that if you let me go, I'd...

151
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,196
After what I told you?

152
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,666
I'll make up for all the rehearsals.

153
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:26,237
I'm nearly never at home. I can't stand the boy's complaints!

154
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:29,175
That's out of the question. You're not going anywhere!

155
00:13:33,476 --> 00:14:20,676
¤ Radio plays a dramatic story about climbers on Mount Everest ¤

156
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:27,472
Oh my God! Leave it alone, please. The steaks were supposed to be for Sunday.

157
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,353
Go wash yourself.

158
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:47,257
I wonder that you can listen to it...

159
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,894
You bought beer?

160
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:34,651
I'm asking you, why did you buy the beer?

161
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,740
I thought he would come.

162
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,069
Who?

163
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,219
The Minister.

164
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:45,560
Aniczka? You should go.

165
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,583
You know what, Carla? Vasek can take the TV to his room.

166
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,243
There's Chaplin at 19:30.

167
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,928
I don't want Chaplin. I want you to be at home! Just like a proper mom...

168
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,570
To make Vasek to be the main class cleaner is just like making a goat the head gardener.

169
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,905
But this week he was amazing.

170
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:43,158
He really cleaned up the classroom and in addition he was helping the school caretaker and sports teacher.

171
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,580
I thought he'd done something wrong when you called me at the theater.

172
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,495
We wrote an essay yesterday.

173
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,496
Please, don't tell Vasek that I let you read it.

174
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:12,679
He's a mug. "Mommy is going to get married." Such nonsense!

175
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,152
Do you know what's the best about children?

176
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,603
That they can see the world how it's supposed to be.

177
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:26,953
And their world is mainly a harmonic home.

178
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,514
And what would you do, if you were me, Mrs. Teacher?

179
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:40,045
I would at least think about it, Mommy.

180
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,092
You're going to let me go to the mountains.

181
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,897
You'd have to resign from the theater.

182
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:13,026
I can also break up with you.

183
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,775
Mommy! Mommy's here.

184
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,714
You usually don't even speak to me...

185
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:31,274
Guess who came to have dinner with us?

186
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:40,375
~ Girl, in a wig again. That will destroy your hair.
~ You scared me!

187
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:45,943
If it didn't involve us, we could just laugh at the Vasek's ideas.

188
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:49,330
It was really funny to make steaks for the school caretaker...

189
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:53,250
Do you go anywhere on evenings at all?

190
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,072
To theater.

191
00:18:56,145 --> 00:19:02,422
Why don't you call me? If I don't have a night shift, I'll be able to wait here with Vasek until 11.

192
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,902
And in the evening you'll have to travel through the whole Prague.

193
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,415
And what about Jindrich?

194
00:19:10,544 --> 00:19:15,556
If he had children, I wouldn't say a word. But in this situation...

195
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,802
Do you think this is a life, Anna?

196
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,516
He likes me.

197
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,323
Then why doesn't he finally get divorced?

198
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:26,702
Please, let it be.

199
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:28,976
All right then.

200
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,870
I'll talk to Jindrich myself.

201
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,566
You've never meddled.

202
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:39,017
I'm not going to humiliate myself.

203
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,077
You behave just like life hasn't taught you enough.

204
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,777
How long do you want to handle it by yourself?

205
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,397
It's hard with you, Anna.

206
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:57,958
When I told you in that situation a baby shouldn't be born, you didn't talk to me for a half year.

207
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,178
You did it your way.

208
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:04,633
You didn't know what you were facing.

209
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:10,099
Talk to Jindrich. You'll save yourself only if you get married.

210
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:14,788
You can always give me advice. But you can't help me and take Vasek to the mountains.

211
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:19,556
I've already told you that mothers with children will get a holiday in that school holidays week.

212
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,020
Then I have bad luck, since I don't work as a surgery nurse.

213
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:28,021
I can save up a few days of holiday if I work 16-hour shifts.

214
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,181
I'll take Vasek to my place.

215
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:36,951
No, that wouldn't help. All the people in the house know me, somebody could tell Vasek something...

216
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,856
Someday Vasek will know it anyway.

217
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,977
How long are you going to hide it from him?

218
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,227
Many children live just with a mother. Aren't there divorced marriages?

219
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:54,693
But you -- are not divorced...

220
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:26,294
Come in, little dog, come in. Don't be afraid. This is my mommy.

221
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:29,795
Send that calf away immediately!

222
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,742
Mommy! What about me??

223
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,445
Mommy, why was uncle Jindrich at the train station with flowers?

224
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,782
He came to tell me not to break a leg.

225
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,060
You like him?

226
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,041
A lot.

227
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:22,718
But it's also going to cost a lot of money.

228
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,053
I meant Jindrich.

229
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,553
Why are you talking about that again?

230
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:31,129
I don't like him. I'd know some better guys.

231
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:38,220
Vasek, I'm warning you. I took you here with one condition -- that you'll stop finding me a groom.

232
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,510
You can rely on me!

233
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,328
Daddy, Daddy, I can't find ski poles!

234
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,634
Then buy a medicine against sclerosis.

235
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:09,477
Thank you. Mrs. Bendová, you have telegram here.

236
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:12,388
Here.

237
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:24,027
I need to call Prague. Immediately. And a second call at 7 pm.

238
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:25,511
All right.

239
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:37,904
Vasek! You're not going to leave the terrace until I come back!

240
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:39,228
Of course!

241
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,640
Attention!

242
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,644
I'm going!

243
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:53,515
Out of the way!

244
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,286
Attention!

245
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,301
I'm going!

246
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:15,717
Stupid boy! If I were your dad, I would beat your buttocks that you wouldn't be able to sit for a week!

247
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,802
~ Are you OK?
~ Yes.

248
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:20,250
~ What about your legs?
~ Tangled.

249
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:25,007
Stand up then.

250
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,225
~ Where are you from?
~ From the Snow White lodge!

251
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:30,337
From the Snow White lodge? Hm. I'm really happy.

252
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:36,190
With whom are you here? Why are you looking at me? With who are you here?

253
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,402
With Mom, of course!

254
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:49,140
Take your skis --- and go.

255
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:59,408
Hello, sir, are you married?

256
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,552
Vasek, Vasíczek, come quickly!

257
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,500
This sweater really suits you, you're very nice in it.

258
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,042
Why aren't you wearing pajamas?

259
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,804
Am I supposed to go to the dinner in pajamas?

260
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:15,237
No. We are going to have dinner here.

261
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:20,369
Mom, Mommy, I want to go to a bar. At least for an ice cream.

262
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,899
No, you have a lot of sins today and I've ordered a call.

263
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,449
Mommy, I arranged something. He's going to wait there for me.

264
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:31,941
Who?

265
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,137
One of my friends.

266
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,823
I'll return in a while.

267
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,227
And you --- stay in the room, do you understand?

268
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:26,637
Anna.

269
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:34,793
Oh wow, you grew up! Even though you're still so petite.

270
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,097
You don't remember me.

271
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,050
~ I...
~ Don't you remember?

272
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,971
~ I'm waiting here.
~ Ma'am, your call.

273
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,395
I'm sorry.

274
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:55,716
No, the telegram wasn't sent by Jindrich, but by the theater.

275
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:58,966
Mommy... Please, come and stay at least those two days.

276
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,617
I can't tell Vasek that we've just arrived and we have to go straight home again.

277
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,777
I'm going to return on Thursday.

278
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,885
It's not important who's sick.

279
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:12,626
There's a change in the theater.

280
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:17,248
We can't do anything then.

281
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:28,027
~ How much is it?
~ One moment. I'll ask the post office.

282
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,143
How many years since we haven't seen each other?

283
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:40,256
You're here on holiday? As an instructor again?

284
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,848
I've worked here for seven years.

285
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:42,599
Here?

286
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,547
Here I have a date with one boy.

287
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,544
With a boy?

288
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:52,165
I even don't know his name. I promised him to have an ice cream with him in the evening and now I've met you here!

289
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:55,683
You're better and better. Instead of a drink, you invite boys for ice cream?

290
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:59,682
But he's really small. You haven't seen such a boy yet.

291
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:04,106
He told me his mommy loves dancing and if I wanted, he could take her with him.

292
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,269
Please, why are you telling me?

293
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,657
Well, you asked me what I was doing here.

294
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,726
Maybe we'll meet again.

295
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,428
Definitely.

296
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:17,635
So don't delay yourself. Don't make him wait in the bar.

297
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,922
He isn't waiting in the bar. He's there.

298
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,043
Vasek! Come here!

299
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,214
You have a primo boy.

300
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,766
He's wild. What is this?

301
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,038
That's a jacket.

302
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,451
Say goodbye and go to bed.

303
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,077
Goodbye.

304
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:30,965
Bye.

305
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,584
Prague. Who wanted to pay the call to Prague?

306
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,341
I'll pay it.

307
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:53,096
Mommy! Mommy! Open up! I didn't tell him anything! Really! Mommy! Open up!

308
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,995
Vasek, you are going to worry me to death. What did you tell him?

309
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,178
Only number of our room.

310
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,726
And you invited him, didn't you?

311
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,174
Yes, I wanted you to look at him.

312
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:07,987
What?

313
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:12,275
If we liked him, then we could be friends with him.

314
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,047
That's all.

315
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:18,924
Pack your stuff up. We're going home.

316
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,666
Tomorrow.

317
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,298
Mountain Rescue.

318
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,654
No. He's on the hill.

319
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,690
What are you doing here?

320
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,498
I came for help.

321
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:50,508
What happened?

322
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,663
Mommy forbade me to talk about it.

323
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,721
About what?

324
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,593
That we're going home today.

325
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,513
She promises we'll return, but we won't be back.

326
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,709
I know her!

327
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:05,057
You finally called. How is it on the hill?

328
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:07,938
If mom knew that I'm under someone's supervision...

329
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,423
Avalanche situation?

330
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:13,248
I'll take care of myself, anyway. I'll sweep, I'll do laundry.

331
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:18,747
When it's warmer, when it's warmer. Warn these locations immediately.

332
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:23,447
Please, sir, let me stay here. I'm made for the mountains.

333
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:26,956
So you're applying for service here? For how long?

334
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:29,847
Two days. Until Mom comes back.

335
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:31,292
Who's that boy?

336
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,840
Well, he's such a Dopey from Snow White, isn't he?

337
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,193
You make jokes and there's blocked snow plow in Labský Dùl.

338
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:40,053
I've been having fun with that for a half hour now.

339
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:44,156
Call Karel. I'll be there.

340
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,525
And what about me?

341
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:49,474
You know what? A real man never begs.

342
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:59,469
If it helps you, you can leave the boy here.

343
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,484
Vasek?

344
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:05,536
You got more of them? It's hard for him. He's just come and he has to go back to the town.

345
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:06,873
Well, he'll get over it.

346
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:13,354
There are things, which no woman can understand. Simply --- I'll take care of Vasek for those two days.

347
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,228
I don't understand why.

348
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:21,003
We haven't had opportunity to talk yet. I'll have a guarantee that you're going to come back.

349
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,407
You would be able to take care of a child??

350
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,162
You can rely on me!

351
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,408
I'm not so sure about that.

352
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:48,437
Vasek, we'll go to Rokytnice for ski poles. And we'll take Mom to the train station.

353
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,670
Vasek, are you really going to let me go by myself?

354
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,897
You've already said I could. Don't worry.

355
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,121
Lubos rescues people from avalanches!

356
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,116
What do you mean --- Lubos? It's always Mr. Richman for you!

357
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:04,011
Mommy doesn't know that we've been already friends for two hours.

358
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:05,784
Vasek is coming with me!

359
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:10,657
You have a great seat by the window. Don't worry, I've already cared for a whole climbing tea.

360
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,333
I'll die from fear anyway.

361
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,787
That would be a pity.

362
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:19,383
Mommy is prima. She's already started calling you by first name.

363
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,927
Bye.

364
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:50,010
How did you figure out I'm a climber?

365
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,054
I'm Detective Colombo. You have crampons in your cabin.

366
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:55,980
You know what they are?

367
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:57,666
~ Of course!
~ What?

368
00:32:57,924 --> 00:32:59,708
Metal boots for climbing.

369
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,073
Look, where you are throwing the snow!

370
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,917
And what is Chomolungma?

371
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:11,605
Mount Everest. Hillary and Tenzing were the first people there.

372
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,397
And which mountain over 8,000 meters high was first visited by people?

373
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:19,630
Annapurna.

374
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:22,988
And where were the most dead people?

375
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,607
Nanga Parbat.

376
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:27,635
And who was the first up there?

377
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:31,603
Hermann Buhl. He's my second favorite. After my daddy.

378
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:33,786
You're good.

379
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:42,226
I have books. The Unbeaten Mountain. Tigers from Himalaya. That's on radio.

380
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,890
~ Done?
~ Done!

381
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,735
Go!

382
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,807
And who buys those books for you?

383
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,780
Daddy?

384
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:54,376
Daddy was also a climber!

385
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:58,207
And what does he do now?

386
00:33:58,307 --> 00:33:59,887
Now he's dead.

387
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,922
Don't be upset with me, Vasek, I didn't know that.

388
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:11,067
When they were walking in a line, he was the last one. And suddenly there was an avalanche.

389
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:15,204
Wow! We rescued a snow plow!

390
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,263
You'll take my sleeping bag. Once my only friend also borrowed it.

391
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:30,005
He got intestinal flu. That's really bad, when it's -20° C.

392
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:30,984
And where did you sleep?

393
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:33,331
Well, we didn't sleep much.

394
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,799
Do you have a lot of friends?

395
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:40,893
No, I have a lot of acquaintances. Friends are boys who you can always rely on.

396
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:45,049
Mom says that daddy had no friends.

397
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,382
That's weird.

398
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:53,219
When you hold the same rope with somebody, you must trust him. You cover his back and he covers yours.

399
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:55,729
Then there's a real friendship.

400
00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:01,725
Maybe Mom thinks that somebody could have rescued him. Maybe the friend of his.

401
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:40,920
I'd like to call Spindler¿v Mlýn, 93439. Thank you.

402
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,388
You can cancel it.

403
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,479
He called himself.

404
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:46,825
Who?

405
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,824
Spindler¿v Mlýn.

406
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:53,345
He told me to write it down, in case I have sclerosis...

407
00:35:54,677 --> 00:36:00,389
Vasek ate seven dumplings, brushed his teeth, and now he's asleep like a log.

408
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,329
He's an idiot. He's making fun of me.

409
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:10,649
But he called an hour later, saying it's snowing outside, and that he can't fall asleep.

410
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:13,350
Bozenka, I'm hungry!

411
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,049
Today you were great, Anna.

412
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,714
You made me really happy.

413
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:22,958
That is probably because I took a nap in the afternoon.

414
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:27,657
Took a nap? She was sleeping here for three hours as if she were dead.

415
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:35,307
May I invite you for a dinner?

416
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:49,627
Oh my God...

417
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:53,594
I'll make seven pieces of him!

418
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,777
Why did you try do make fire?

419
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:01,695
I just wanted to make toast for you.

420
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,258
It's already burning! You can rely on me.

421
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,378
You can rely on me, too. Do I need my belt for you?

422
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:12,925
Look. I borrowed these boots for you.

423
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:16,132
Yours are good for dancing lessons, at best.

424
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:22,416
Lubos, how does a man become a real climber?

425
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,479
When he climbs his first hill.

426
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:25,675
Which one?

427
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:31,687
That's not important. When you like it, you're going to be climber for a whole life!

428
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:37,688
You must have a will of iron and you have to know how to make decisions!

429
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,776
Like what?

430
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:45,064
Where to put your hands, your legs, how to keep warm.

431
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:49,171
That's simple. You make a mistake and you're dead.

432
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:53,452
I don't know... I'm sure my dad didn't make a mistake!

433
00:37:53,552 --> 00:38:01,575
I meant it another way.
A proper man is the most happy when he can overcome obstacles.

434
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:06,072
My dad was proper! Strong! One head taller than you.

435
00:38:06,172 --> 00:38:11,324
Of course. The best man goes always the last in a line.

436
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,551
You were never afraid?

437
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:22,317
When you want to win, to beat a 8,000 m high mountain, which has been there for millions of years, you must have courage.

438
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,382
So you weren't afraid.

439
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:25,045
I was afraid.

440
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:29,517
The wind in Himalayas sounds like an oncoming train!

441
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,618
Once it made me cry.

442
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:34,259
My dad was also in Himalayas.

443
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,176
Why didn't you turn back?

444
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:38,933
At night? We couldn't see.

445
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,216
And in the morning?

446
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,225
We started getting to the peak.

447
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,757
You managed it?

448
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,724
It was the happiest day in my life.

449
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:54,466
The sun rose. There was silence. Only rocks and ice.

450
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,812
You stand there and feel like God.

451
00:38:57,912 --> 00:39:01,531
I'm also going to be a little God! But Mom can't know that!

452
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,415
A lot of people think that every climber is crazy.

453
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:05,953
I'm crazy.

454
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:10,180
I can see that. You're putting salt into your tea!

455
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,779
Hold tight! Hold tight! Hold tight!

456
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:22,563
One and two, one and two, one and two...

457
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:32,564
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...
~ One and two, one and two, one and two...

458
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:49,391
I went to see a lawyer.

459
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:52,495
You're buying or selling something?

460
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,363
A divorce lawyer.

461
00:40:55,446 --> 00:41:01,280
What if the two of us tried it, according to the rules?

462
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:05,446
I just don't know if I'll get used to Vasek.

463
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:33,499
Do you know how to pull a whale's tooth?

464
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:45,253
You get a sea crane, you give a wagonload of anesthetic to a whale, you prepare dynamite, 3, 2, 1, boom!

465
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,769
What are you laughing at?

466
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:52,920
I've never kissed a guy.

467
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,971
How so? You didn't like your dad?

468
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:00,105
I did! But I've never actually met him.

469
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:06,393
~ Listen, friend, aren't you a little liar, by any chance?
~ A big one!

470
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:10,757
Your dad was one head taller than me in the morning and now you don't even know him?

471
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:13,552
In that time I was little like this.

472
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,207
Mommy didn't get married again?

473
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:23,087
No. I'd also like to have a daddy. Standa has already a third one.

474
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:29,777
Mommy probably loved daddy a lot. When somebody loves somebody, he can't forget her.

475
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:34,363
You'd be surprised how angry she is when I draw Annapurna.

476
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:37,527
Your daddy was at Annapurna?

477
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:40,415
Of course. His grave's there.

478
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,269
I was also at Annapurna.

479
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,106
With my daddy?

480
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:47,906
No, of us, all returned home.

481
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:52,764
My daddy was in the special expedition. They examined the soil under the icecap.

482
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:58,814
Look, I'm a great dressmaker.

483
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:06,276
Wait, wait, wait. You want to claim that your daddy was in expedition Annapurna with special geologic program?

484
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,668
Of course.

485
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,009
And when was it?

486
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:11,001
When I was little like this.

487
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:14,756
Vasek, Vasek, what are you playing at?

488
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:18,040
You were little like this and you remember that your dad had shoulders like this?

489
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,095
I have a photo at home.

490
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,785
And you've never seen your dad?

491
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:25,496
I'm telling you, that I was little like this.

492
00:43:25,596 --> 00:43:27,566
And what is it, little like this? What is it?

493
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,055
When I was in my mommy's belly!

494
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,212
You're 8 years old?

495
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:34,088
Yes.

496
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:39,883
And you were born in... September?

497
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:42,125
Damn it, you're a psychic.

498
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:08,653
What are you doing?

499
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,051
I'm checking how much snow there's going to be tomorrow.

500
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,101
You don't have to repeat every silly thing I do.

501
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:16,817
Vasek, what would you say if I tried dating your mommy?

502
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,246
You would try it?

503
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:23,033
Would I try it... I will *do* it!

504
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:26,481
You like my mom?

505
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:31,032
~ I like YOU!
~ I like you, too!

506
00:45:41,518 --> 00:45:43,990
~ Lubos, you must be careful!
~ About what?

507
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:50,772
That trying! Mom doesn't want to hear a word about marriage. She's nearly beaten me!

508
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,597
I'll do what I can.

509
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:01,683
~ Vasek!
~ Mommy!

510
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:31,795
What are you doing?

511
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:34,052
We arranged that, didn't we?

512
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:37,321
Yes, but kissing was Lubos's idea!

513
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:38,987
Stand up, lazy people! Stand up!

514
00:47:45,201 --> 00:47:49,258
~ One, two, one, two...
~ One, two, one, two...

515
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:04,582
The boy skis great, what do you think?

516
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:20,677
Knees bent...swivel those hips...go on...!

517
00:48:22,878 --> 00:48:26,678
Keep your knees together! Stop!

518
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:47,179
Anna, when did we date each other?

519
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:50,761
You know, I really can't remember...

520
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:53,800
I think we could figure it out.

521
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,861
You were at the conservatory.

522
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:00,797
It's not important today, anyway.

523
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,016
And wasn't it before I went to Annapurna?

524
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:11,034
I really don't know.

525
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:13,074
If you think...

526
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:18,162
It only seems to me that Vasek wants to look like me.

527
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,292
As if I were his daddy.

528
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:25,468
Well, it probably only seems like that.

529
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,745
Probably.

530
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,877
Vasek wants to look like everybody. It was a school caretaker last time.

531
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:36,488
But a school caretaker isn't a climber.

532
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,646
Buried under an avalanche.

533
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:44,061
To our last evening.

534
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,477
Why did you take me here?

535
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:51,175
I was thinking it's a really long time since you've been dancing.

536
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:55,708
Everything is like old times.

537
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:58,629
No. Nothing can be repeated.

538
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:09,174
I'm leaving for the Alps in a month. Before that I'm going to be in Prague for a few days.

539
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:11,838
Think about the "date" until that time.

540
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:14,589
What date?

541
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:19,780
You arranged me a funeral --- I'm going to arrange you a wedding.

542
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,933
Wait, whom am I going to marry?

543
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,180
Me, of course.

544
00:50:26,781 --> 00:50:28,381
You're getting divorced?

545
00:50:28,537 --> 00:50:28,537
I haven't ever gotten married.

546
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:34,798
I haven't told you yet? I have such a miserable memory...

547
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,799
I can't even remember the size of my shirt.

548
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:42,315
Do you remember that we were here back then?

549
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:46,205
Nine years ago, this was the only place with a music box.

550
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:55,184
Do you remember about our bet that you would bring me flowers in 10 minutes?

551
00:50:55,672 --> 00:50:57,031
And I lost.

552
00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:02,096
No. Mountain rescue called about emergency situation.

553
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,829
A man lost in Ob¿í D¿l.

554
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,566
I'm glad that you remember the details.

555
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:13,432
You rescued that man. You returned after midnight.

556
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:19,033
Why didn't you get married?

557
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:21,712
And why didn't *you* get married?

558
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:25,869
I've always been more attracted by mountains.

559
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,155
And what about now?

560
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,967
Now I'm not strong enough for the hills.

561
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,407
By that you mean you'd be strong enough for me.

562
00:51:36,622 --> 00:51:39,311
No. For our boy.

563
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,831
You don't have to tell me anything.

564
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:52,132
I won't reproach you. We'd known each other for fourteen days.

565
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:53,663
Nine days.

566
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,841
You were dating somebody. And I was in the way.

567
00:51:58,168 --> 00:51:59,946
And what have you been doing for that eight years?

568
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:00,046
Whom did you want to marry anyway?

569
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,443
Vasek is not your son.

570
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:07,618
You are lying. We met here. In December.

571
00:52:07,718 --> 00:52:10,578
I went to Himalayas in January. And the boy was born in September.

572
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:13,408
We returned from expedition in November. All of us.

573
00:52:13,662 --> 00:52:18,763
~ Nobody stayed on Annapurna under an avalanche.
~ I hope you won't be so stupid as to tell Vasek.

574
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:23,757
If this is your decision --- you can rely on me.

575
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:32,049
I was so happy with my friends that I didn't realize I was living alone.

576
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:38,921
For example, this Christmas. There were a lot of people around me but no "my" person.

577
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:43,267
And as I started thinking about it,
such a primo boy appears.

578
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,406
And on top of that --- he's mine.

579
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:49,147
Anna. Tell me. I'm begging you...

580
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,460
Tell me he's mine.

581
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:54,241
Please, don't be crazy.

582
00:52:57,616 --> 00:53:00,439
I hoped I wouldn't meet you ever again.

583
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:07,153
If somebody is in my way today, I'll put him in the sack and I'll throw into the river!

584
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:15,644
You can guess, you can count, but you don't have a single proof that Vasek is yours.

585
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:16,581
I do.

586
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:22,151
He's as amazing as me!

587
00:54:04,149 --> 00:54:05,353
Where were you running?

588
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,603
To the train station. Lubos is coming today!

589
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,427
Which Lubos?

590
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:09,592
My daddy!

591
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:10,711
A spare one.

592
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,540
So Mom found somebody, after all?

593
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,784
No. I found him by myself!

594
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:17,736
He wrote nine letters to him!

595
00:54:19,012 --> 00:54:20,225
What is he like?

596
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:23,956
A big one. A chief of a mountain rescue service.

597
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:32,592
Mom has a first rehearsal today. We have to wait outside.

598
00:54:33,157 --> 00:54:34,498
Let's go inside then!

599
00:54:48,297 --> 00:54:49,685
This is Mom?

600
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:54,334
Damn it, she's got steam!

601
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,556
We're going to sleep in the same room.

602
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,714
And who's the guy?

603
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:32,197
Uncle Jindrich.

604
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:50,610
I don't like him! He's not friendly and he doesn't like dogs.

605
00:55:55,343 --> 00:55:59,790
Then we'll put him in the sack and we'll throw him into the river.

606
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,376
Enough!

607
00:56:04,852 --> 00:56:06,051
This is Annapurna.

608
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,195
And up there?

609
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:09,842
Also Annapurna. Also Annapurna.

610
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:14,956
I screwed this one up. This was in December. This was when I was 5.

611
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:17,888
And why is there a Christmas tree and those presents?

612
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,885
For my daddy, of course. So that he's not alone on Christmas.

613
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,814
~ I'll take you with me.
~ Really?

614
00:56:33,258 --> 00:56:34,483
When you are adult.

615
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:37,925
~ Do you have that photo?
~ It's hidden away.

616
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,772
Then show it to me.

617
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:50,206
I don't want Mommy to steal it.

618
00:56:58,435 --> 00:57:00,056
Let me guess, will you?

619
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,655
Am I right?

620
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,292
You knew my daddy?

621
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:10,996
Are you able to be silent?

622
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:13,180
In front of your mom?

623
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,515
This is me.

624
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,070
It's not you! It's my dad!

625
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:24,609
It's your dad, but it's also me!

626
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:25,750
What does that mean?

627
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,142
I don't know!

628
00:57:28,832 --> 00:57:30,331
That I'm your dad.

629
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,660
That's not true!

630
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,124
It's not you! It's my dad!

631
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,832
Why couldn't it be me?

632
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,572
My dad is dead! A hero!

633
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:40,954
What are you doing here?

634
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:42,388
Lubos is lying.

635
00:57:42,842 --> 00:57:47,410
Anna, please, don't be mad with me. I told him.

636
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:52,598
You are egotistical. Idiot!

637
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,308
Do you have a knife?

638
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:07,435
I've been collecting these cars for five years.

639
00:58:10,248 --> 00:58:14,096
All of them are yours now.

640
00:58:24,893 --> 00:58:28,641
You mustn't take him seriously, Mom. He's a liar.

641
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:32,665
And don't swear at him. He's going to have dinner with us.

642
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:36,025
I'll help you.

643
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,571
Me too.

644
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:52,509
Mommy, how come Lubos knew my dad?

645
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:55,509
I didn't know him.

646
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:57,058
Why is he lying?

647
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:01,760
You pointed at him. Were you his friend?

648
00:59:06,124 --> 00:59:07,860
I don't know.

649
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:12,211
But I know! You left him under the avalanche!

650
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:13,732
Damn it!

651
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,238
Say something, Anna.

652
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,100
Leave me alone. Both of you.

653
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,187
I'll tell you something.

654
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:33,687
If my dad were alive, he would be
at home with me every evening.

655
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,646
He would go to the cinema with me.

656
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:38,626
And we would have a dog.

657
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,598
But your dad didn't know that you existed.

658
00:59:41,698 --> 00:59:43,023
If he knew, he would visit you.

659
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:48,042
And why didn't he visit Mom? He knew she exists.

660
00:59:48,737 --> 00:59:51,336
Mom, is he my dad?

661
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:57,872
~ Is he or not?
~ Give me a break.
~ I want to know!

662
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,544
Yes, this is your dad.

663
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:14,031
You screwed it up. Everything.

664
01:00:15,372 --> 01:00:19,123
Let Mom be! Go away!

665
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:36,641
Mommy, don't cry.

666
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:39,256
He's already gone.

667
01:00:40,062 --> 01:00:43,131
You've got me. I'm going to be with you.

668
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:46,199
Until we die. Every day.

669
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:15,347
Look, my dad is as accurate as a clock.

670
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:28,150
Your mother called.

671
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,829
She arranged a meeting with me.

672
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:33,451
Tomorrow.

673
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:36,080
Don't you know what she wants to tell me?

674
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,693
I can imagine what. To make you get divorced.

675
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:40,925
And you don't want me to?

676
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:47,240
I haven't been wishing anything else for four years.

677
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:55,284
Maybe it would be worth it. To talk about us.

678
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:01,851
You should meet Vasek. Not me.

679
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,040
I've been waiting in front of the school for an hour.

680
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:05,722
So?

681
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:11,077
Nothing.

682
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,311
Why didn't you listen to me?

683
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:17,090
I knew Vasek would never understand.

684
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:20,691
Can I visit you?

685
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:24,119
At 4? At 5?

686
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,249
You aren't interested in who was it??

687
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,786
I'll come in the evening.

688
01:02:30,035 --> 01:02:31,973
I don't even know you!

689
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:34,322
You don't know anything about me either...

690
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,356
And you made Vasek think we're going to live together.

691
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:37,730
I'm afraid he doesn't want to talk to me.

692
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,221
You could have written a letter.

693
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,152
I read about your return from Himalayas in the newspapers.

694
01:02:45,164 --> 01:02:47,028
Why didn't you write you were pregnant?

695
01:02:47,317 --> 01:02:50,446
Where? To Asia? Camp number 4?

696
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,999
I returned.

697
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:55,348
The boy was nearly three months old.

698
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:57,929
Why did you want Vasek never to know me?

699
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:02,240
What did I do to you?

700
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:12,305
I...I was kind of proud to be pregnant with you.

701
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,743
I thought you were hero, when you rescued that man in Obøí Dùl.

702
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:28,613
I thought...I thought you were going to be happy when you returned.

703
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:31,432
That I'm as brave as you.

704
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:34,713
That I kept the baby.

705
01:03:39,474 --> 01:03:43,288
But if you wrote the boy was born...

706
01:03:44,145 --> 01:03:50,633
You didn't even remember me and you'd be so happy to have a baby?

707
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,346
When are you leaving?

708
01:03:56,495 --> 01:03:58,318
In four days.

709
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:05,703
Vasek needs time to get over it.

710
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,587
If children could understand everything,
they wouldn't be children.

711
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:19,612
Because there are more differences between children and adults than size.

712
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:22,118
It was also my fault.

713
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:23,726
It wasn't.

714
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:29,886
Vasík, did you want a dad? You did.

715
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:34,154
You liked Lubos. You said he was a friend.

716
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:39,931
He isn't, Mom. I cried for him while he was in the mountains with foreign friends.

717
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:42,940
Lubos didn't know about you. You must trust me!

718
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,430
He cheated me. He lied to me in the mountains already.

719
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:50,047
He pretended to try dating you, and you got married a long time ago.

720
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,573
No, we didn't.

721
01:04:54,101 --> 01:04:58,489
When I was young, I believed you when you said you bought me in a shop.

722
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:02,121
But now I'm old enough to know how babies are born.

723
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:03,230
Really?

724
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:05,463
After marriage.

725
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:14,388
Well...Marriage isn't the main thing.

726
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:16,209
It can happen when people love each other.

727
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:23,851
If he loved you, Mom, he would visit us on Saturdays or when it's my birthday.

728
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,791
You are stubborn just like your little tooth.

729
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,967
We've been persuading it for two hours but it doesn't give in.

730
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,621
But when it grows up, it won't hurt anymore, will it?

731
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,813
Lubos will be waiting for you tomorrow in front of the school.

732
01:05:41,913 --> 01:05:44,283
I won't be there.

733
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,057
Hello --- I told him.

734
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:17,301
I did what I could.

735
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:22,122
It depends on you.

736
01:06:23,132 --> 01:06:24,483
I'm going to gargle.

737
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:32,659
Vasík, you are a goon. Such beautiful pictures...Why did you destroy them?

738
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:35,150
I won't be a climber anymore.

739
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:25,806
You've got primo bike. You're good at it.

740
01:07:26,812 --> 01:07:34,765
I've bought new equipment. I have it in my hotel. Don't you want to have a look?

741
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,325
I've brought you something.

742
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:49,176
Do you like him?

743
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:50,721
I'm not allowed to bring home strange dogs.

744
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:54,718
He's not a strange dog. He's Ben. Keep him. He's yours.

745
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:57,723
And what about Mom? Won't she beat me?

746
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,159
Don't worry. She'll be happy.

747
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:03,280
You're lying! And you're teaching Mom to lie.

748
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:07,792
You talk about me over the phone.

749
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:33,565
I let you go to the mountains so I wouldn't lose you and there you forgot me in one day.

750
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,070
It's quite funny, actually.

751
01:08:40,775 --> 01:08:45,326
When a man is afraid, he's about to lose it.

752
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:28,755
You really want to go to a hospital?

753
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:33,058
No. Your mother invited me to your place.

754
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:37,189
I would have to know that, wouldn't I?

755
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:38,857
You won't invite me upstairs?

756
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:46,010
You shouldn't have gone with me.

757
01:09:57,043 --> 01:10:01,436
Anna, would you mind Vasek having a dog?

758
01:10:04,187 --> 01:10:05,876
No way.

759
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:10,813
That's a disaster...Don't worry! I'll fix it!

760
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:16,148
Leave me alone. Both of you!

761
01:10:26,546 --> 01:10:27,338
Where is he?

762
01:10:27,595 --> 01:10:29,379
Who? Vasek or that dog?

763
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:31,918
Jindrich, of course!

764
01:10:39,598 --> 01:10:44,751
You've gone crazy. All of you.

765
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:54,740
Mommy, are you glad that we have Beník?

766
01:10:55,052 --> 01:10:56,565
Of course.

767
01:10:57,222 --> 01:10:59,334
Go to wash. Don't play.

768
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:02,079
Come, Beník, we'll make a beautiful dog out of you.

769
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:06,688
Lubos has a dad in Kamenice. They have rabbits.

770
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:12,096
Also a cat. A pig. You would have a grandpa.

771
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:15,388
You always wanted a grandpa, didn't you?

772
01:11:17,162 --> 01:11:20,599
Enough. Everybody can screw up something nice.

773
01:11:20,937 --> 01:11:24,743
Either me or Lubos. But you're a primo boy.

774
01:11:24,843 --> 01:11:28,299
And it was quite good idea with those toothbrushes!

775
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:34,714
~ There should be three people in every family.
~ We are three: you, me, and the dog.

776
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:41,715
The last dress rehearsal! Three minutes! Soloists on stage!

777
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:48,016
Let's go for it, folks! Make it fun!

778
01:11:49,117 --> 01:11:53,017
Spartacus, give Fergie the stick and raise the sword!

779
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:01,208
What's up?

780
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,407
Today I've been waiting for two hours.

781
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:10,367
~ I can't make Vasek talk to you.
~ On stage for rehearsals of "Spartacus"!

782
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,034
He didn't even show up. He's more faithless than a mountain.

783
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:18,977
Anna, I'll won't make it...

784
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,722
Vasek was waiting for you for eight years and you give it up in a handful of days?

785
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:25,550
~ But I'm leaving tomorrow!
~ On stage! On stage!

786
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,940
What if you didn't go to the mountains?

787
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,280
I can't leave my friends.

788
01:12:31,617 --> 01:12:33,972
You're just like an avalanche.

789
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:36,409
You made me a grave, Anna! I wouldn't do that...

790
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:40,909
I wouldn't make to read in the newspaper that somebody is alive and give him funeral.

791
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:44,234
And what was I supposed to tell Vasek, when he started asking about his dad?

792
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:48,521
You waited for me one more year, before he'd started talking?

793
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,440
Three more years, before he'd started thinking.

794
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:56,674
If there was an idiot in this world, it was me.

795
01:12:56,774 --> 01:12:59,445
You don't need to apologize. I don't care about you today.

796
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:04,715
Don't say that...There's our 8-year-old boy to be stubborn.

797
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,419
Aniczka, you must go!

798
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,023
A moment, a moment. Wednesday is visitor's day.

799
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:25,356
My wife's here.

800
01:13:29,619 --> 01:13:30,899
Vasek's got lost.

801
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:32,048
What are you on about now?

802
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:35,569
When I rang and told him about your broken leg, he just went crazy.

803
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,435
Before I packed your stuff up, he was gone.

804
01:13:38,535 --> 01:13:40,356
I've been looking for him for an hour.

805
01:13:40,456 --> 01:13:43,107
Please, don't panic, now he's already at home.

806
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,891
He's been already here?

807
01:13:46,604 --> 01:13:50,219
There are many hospitals in Prague and he found the right one.

808
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,752
We have a clever child, don't we?

809
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:56,639
Why is she staring at us?

810
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,627
She's my mother.

811
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:05,819
Look after his homework and put the keys into the mailbox before you leave.

812
01:14:07,578 --> 01:14:08,873
Go.

813
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:20,841
What a behavior! So you have a child together?! Then explain to me...

814
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,481
He was that rascal??

815
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:30,073
If they don't make peace, I will die...

816
01:14:32,074 --> 01:14:39,074
¤ Radio tells story about the Himalayas... ¤

817
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,794
Why didn't you tell me about having grandma in a hospital?

818
01:14:52,967 --> 01:14:56,030
Can't you imagine how frightened I was?

819
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:39,213
I'll spend the night here.

820
01:15:39,638 --> 01:15:42,277
You don't have to go to Valenta's.

821
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,168
I couldn't come today.

822
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:19,787
Why not?

823
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,132
I had detention.

824
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:23,373
A bummer, isn't it?

825
01:16:23,473 --> 01:16:25,981
Mom has to go to school.

826
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:26,962
And why?

827
01:16:27,579 --> 01:16:29,347
I didn't want to write an essay.

828
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,660
You know what? I'll go to school instead of Mommy.

829
01:16:33,974 --> 01:16:36,012
But you are leaving tomorrow.

830
01:16:36,269 --> 01:16:37,423
I'll stay here with you.

831
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:38,120
You'll go.

832
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:44,637
I'll arrange it with Mom. Girls don't know anything about friendship.

833
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:46,162
And you do?

834
01:16:46,262 --> 01:16:47,551
I do.

835
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:51,039
I've already written that essay.

836
01:16:52,536 --> 01:16:53,671
"What does my dad do?

837
01:16:54,183 --> 01:17:00,423
"My dad is a chief of mountain rescue. He does what he says. He waits for me in front of the school at 3 o'clock.

838
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:03,979
"He's reliable. He bought me a dog.

839
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:09,356
"He's got experience because he's a climber. He climbed a 8, 000 m high mountain.

840
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:12,338
"He gets over all obstacles.

841
01:17:12,438 --> 01:17:15,359
"He's a good friend."

842
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,612
Do you know how to pull a tooth to a kangaroo?

843
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:31,341
You make a sea crane, you prepare dynamite...

844
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,841
It wasn't a kangaroo, it was a whale!

845
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:34,866
That's not important.

846
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:39,623
It is! Because you have to give dynamite to a whale. A kangaroo would visit a dentist.

847
01:17:39,968 --> 01:17:43,128
3, 2, 1!
