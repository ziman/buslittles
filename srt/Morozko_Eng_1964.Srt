16
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:12,228
Once there lived an old man
with his old woman.

17
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,151
They had two daughters:

18
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:21,142
Nastenka, the old man's girl,
Marfoushka, the old woman's.

19
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:58,383
Come on, move, old man!

20
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:05,666
Marfoushka is pested by mosquitoes,
she can't sleep.

21
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:47,973
-What are you doing?
- Knitting stockings for Marfoushka.

22
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,581
You told me to.

23
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:57,970
l told you to knit,
not to click your needles!

24
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:02,654
-You'll wake Marfoushka up.
- Can she hearthrough the wall?

25
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:08,571
You cannot hear it
after working hard all day.

26
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,975
And she dozed all day,

27
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,377
any stir may wake her up now.

28
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,809
You knit here,
then you will not wake her.

29
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,578
Here the moon is bright,

30
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,496
the place is cool and right.

31
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:46,372
The stocking should be ready
by the first roosters' crows,

32
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:51,370
or l will tear your braids
right off!

33
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:11,844
Sit, Tiapa!

34
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:18,878
Have pity on me, dear Rooster,
l've got just one row to knit.

35
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,357
You ought to ask Dawn.

36
00:06:48,404 --> 00:06:50,713
Have pity on me, rosy Dawn!

37
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:54,041
Have mercy, golden Sun!

38
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:59,192
My knitting must be finished,
or l'll be punished.

39
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:03,039
Stepmother'll tear my braids off.

40
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,956
Thank you, rosy Dawn!

41
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,352
Rooster, the golden comb,

42
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,869
thank you, dear bird!

43
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,957
l'm done!

44
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,194
Well, is it ready?

45
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,955
You've done it, you witch,
you wicked little viper!

46
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,547
Next time
l'll give you much harder work.

47
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:51,476
Go feed the chicken,
water the cattle,

48
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,674
split the wood,
sweep the yard.

49
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:43,349
The same morning, the same day,

50
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:48,950
but a different place,
and a different village.

51
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,344
- Sonny!
-What is it now?

52
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,945
Take care of yourself.

53
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,026
- Don't forget your mother.
-All right.

54
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,545
Do not hurt the weak

55
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,944
Honor those who are old.

56
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:36,342
Oh, you dear boy, lvan,
Come to meet me at the gate!

57
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:40,341
l got a brand-new sarafan,
all of silk and lace it's made!

58
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:51,342
Vania, Vania, wait a bit,
where have you been to?

59
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:55,100
Don't pass by, we must meet.
Look into my window!

60
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:05,703
Please, lvan, don't leave forever,
On the porch we'll sit together.

61
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:10,102
Of an apple take a bite.
We'll be talking side by side.

62
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:24,091
Hey, you people, step aside,

63
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:26,862
Make the road real wide.

64
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,932
Me, a handsome, jolly lad,

65
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,780
Strolling in the village.

66
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:38,532
Hey-liuli, hey-liuli,
Let the road be smooth and free.

67
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,336
Ain't l great?

68
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,856
l'm just delight.

69
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,335
Nothing's wrong with me,

70
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:57,537
l'm just right.

71
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:02,334
Hey-liuli, hey-liuli,
Let the road be smooth and free.

72
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:11,173
l can walk all over seas,

73
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:14,335
Moving mountains over.

74
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:18,333
l will find a girl of my dreams,

75
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:22,933
Fair and sweet as clover.

76
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:27,846
Hey-liuli, hey-liuli,
Let the road be smooth and free.

77
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:39,845
We'll rob'em, we won't rob'em,
we'll eat'em, we won't eat'em.

78
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,931
We'll beat'em, we will be beaten...

79
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,164
Hold it!

80
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:40,038
We're going to rob you.

81
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:43,083
- Me?
-You.

82
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,518
Go ahead, rob me.

83
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,317
Why don't the clubs fall down?

84
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:46,521
Just wait.
The'll fall down by next winter.

85
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,679
He's got muscle!

86
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,752
Whether lvan wandered over
for a long time, or not,

87
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,915
that we don't know.

88
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:18,317
But he found himself
in a far-away, strange land.

89
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,914
lvanushka!

90
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,430
Who's playing hide-and-seek?

91
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:03,153
- l do.
-Who? You?

92
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,829
Are you a sorcerer, granddad?

93
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:10,821
l dabble a bit at sorcery.
But l get bored.

94
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,512
Bored?

95
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:16,305
Let's play who is faster!

96
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:21,387
With you? You must be kidding.
l'll catch you in no time.

97
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:27,900
lf you catch me,
l'll give you a bow with arrows.

98
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,305
Agreed.

99
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:35,305
lvanushka!

100
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,985
lvanushka!

101
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:37,299
You can't catch me!

102
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,058
- Can you?
-All right, you win.

103
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:52,895
Since you admit it,
l'll give you what l promised.

104
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:02,492
Well, this is a miracle!

105
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,659
Where would we be
without miracles?

106
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:08,056
So, you are a sorcerer!

107
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:14,215
lvan!

108
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:17,294
- Come back!
-Why?

109
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,738
-You forgot the important thing.
-What is it?

110
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,295
You forgot to thank an old man,

111
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,497
and bow your head before him.

112
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,497
lf l bow before everybody,
l'll lose my head.

113
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,498
Let a bear bow to you.

114
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:39,294
Well, let it be
like you wish.

115
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,814
The bear will bow to me,

116
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:46,054
but it's your back that will bend.

117
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,651
Find a feather in the field
and throw it to the wind.

118
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:22,051
lf you follow that feather,
you will find your destiny.

119
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:27,131
You will find your destiny...

120
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:54,123
You keep cooing, my dear cuckoo.

121
00:19:56,924 --> 00:20:03,271
A long life you promise me,
silly one.

122
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:12,272
But you don't know how hard it is

123
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:22,472
For an orphan to have no mother.

124
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,869
As a birch can't grow without sun,

125
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:59,471
So a girl can't live all alone.

126
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:09,036
So why d'you coo, my dear cuckoo?

127
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:19,467
A long life you promise me,
silly one?

128
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,548
How do you do, fair maid?

129
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,104
How do you do, lovely girl!

130
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,258
Don't be afraid of me.
Look at me, my darling.

131
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:31,027
-Am l not nice?
- l've got no time.

132
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,776
-What are you doing?
-Watering this old stump.

133
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,776
How long will you water it?

134
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:46,625
Until flowers bloom on it.

135
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,341
- Flowers?
- My stepmother told me to.

136
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:54,706
- She must be very wicked.
- No, she's just a stepmother.

137
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,184
-What's your name?
- My name is Nastya.

138
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:04,260
But they call me different names:

139
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:08,455
My father calls me Nastenka.

140
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:12,779
My sister calls me Nastka.

141
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:17,455
My stepmother calls me a witch
and a wicked viper.

142
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,621
Nastenka...

143
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:25,342
-Will you marry me?
-You're too quick!

144
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,017
Why not?
l'm not crippled, nor cross-eyed.

145
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:32,101
Right, but we don't make
a good couple.

146
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:35,260
-Why?
- l'm not a braggart.

147
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:40,100
You think l'm bragging?
l can do anything!

148
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:44,259
With a plough l'm a pro,
in a fight l'm a knight.

149
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:47,857
l'm a dancer, l'm a worker,
l'm a hunter, l'm a stalker.

150
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,452
- l'll fell it with one arrow.
- No, it's got cubs!

151
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,615
Big deal!

152
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,617
Tiapa! Tiapa!

153
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:18,176
What's the matter, Nastya?

154
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:34,445
She's alive!

155
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:50,445
What have you done to me,
the witch?

156
00:24:56,974 --> 00:25:01,524
lvanushka!
l haven't done anything to you!

157
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,251
Damn you!

158
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,921
Wicked viper!

159
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:17,084
l killed you with an arrow,
and you ruined me with a feather.

160
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:36,434
lf you hadn't acted like a bear,
you wouldn't look like a bear.

161
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,078
Oh, lvan, the bear head!

162
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:52,434
Forgive me, Granddad Mushroom.

163
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:56,560
lt is just the way you said:

164
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:01,312
The bear bows to me,
but it's your back that bends.

165
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:03,836
You taught me a good lesson.

166
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,158
Please, tell me what l should do
to be a man again?

167
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,239
All right, the bear head.

168
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,757
Look at the way you lived.

169
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:22,079
You just boasted
and admired yourself.

170
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,066
Loved yourself and hurt others.

171
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,590
- Nastenka, for one.
- Nastenka?

172
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:34,666
Nobody saw any good from you.

173
00:27:34,877 --> 00:27:37,152
That's my answer and my advice.

174
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:41,236
To take it you have to be wise.

175
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:45,435
What's so wise about it?
l'll go and do a good deed.

176
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:49,424
And through a good deed
l'll get myformer self, indeed.

177
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,744
You haven't understood anything.

178
00:28:16,473 --> 00:28:19,988
What good deed can l do foryou?

179
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,908
Wait, you fools!

180
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,428
Don't run away!

181
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:33,909
l want to do good foryou!

182
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:36,904
Wait!

183
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:33,821
A bear!

184
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,221
Awerewolf!

185
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:12,491
Hello, dearflowers
on the dry stump.

186
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:20,420
l come here every day,

187
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,576
l charm you in every little way.

188
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,498
Am l bothering you?

189
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,410
No, l am not.

190
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,216
Tell me, flowers,
is lvanushka still alive?

191
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,658
He is.

192
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:44,577
ls he still angrywith me?

193
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,974
No, he is not.

194
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:57,051
Shall we ever meet again?

195
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:24,203
Have mercy,
brothers and sisters.

196
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:27,651
Give alms
for my subsistence.

197
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:30,414
Whateveryou can,

198
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:35,403
For an orphan
who is hungry and wan.

199
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:39,403
- How much is in your cup?
- Not a half copeck.

200
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:42,809
lf that's so, here's a copeck.

201
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:48,130
lt seems a copeck
is not enough for a good deed.

202
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:50,964
Where are you going?

203
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:56,040
Awere wolf!
Run for your life!

204
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,402
What good deed shall l do?

205
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:19,398
Nastya, give us the braid!

206
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:23,888
Mom, whiten her brows!

207
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:36,485
Oh, my lovely darling!

208
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:40,965
Nastka's braid is nicerthan mine.

209
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,396
For yours we paid at the fair.

210
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:45,039
Cut her braid off!

211
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,204
What shall l drag her by, then?

212
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,401
We'll hide her braid under a rag.

213
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:52,561
All right.

214
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,634
Love to munch
when the stove's all smudged?

215
00:33:05,844 --> 00:33:09,041
Go like that, you viper!
You'll do betterwiping.

216
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:13,033
Trythat...

217
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,392
Oh, you're a princess!

218
00:33:19,922 --> 00:33:21,958
- Really?
-You are

219
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,558
A princess...

220
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:35,197
- l'm tired, l'm hot.
- Shut up and bearthe lot.

221
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,956
No, you're not a princess.

222
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,391
-Who, then?
-A queen!

223
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,466
What good deed could l do?

224
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:13,389
- Granny, let me help you.
- Please, be so good.

225
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:19,387
With pleasure.
l need badlyto do good.

226
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,109
- Then do it.
- Climb on.

227
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:24,035
-Where to?
- On my hump.

228
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:30,872
- Do you live farfrom here?
-Veryfar, my dear.

229
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:34,385
Up the hill, then down the hill,
then up the hill again.

230
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:36,551
That's great!

231
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,552
lt's great, but don't get sweaty.

232
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,551
Come on, let's go!

233
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:45,784
My daughter is so right.
She works day and night.

234
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:48,791
She sweeps, she sews, she knits,
She won't say a word against it.

235
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:53,191
She starts a stove in the morning,
She gets it cooking and broiling.

236
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:56,027
The floor she mops all shining,
She's great at wining and dining.

237
00:34:56,233 --> 00:35:01,386
Yeah, such a wonder
you can't even dream of.

238
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,107
Matchmaker, you're overdoing it.

239
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:12,180
We hear
you have another daughter.

240
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:15,791
People babble like it's scrabble.

241
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:18,788
l'm the daughter,
the other is a stepdaughter.

242
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,868
Be so kind, show us the other kind.

243
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,469
Mommy!

244
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,459
lfyou insist, here she is.

245
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,786
Nastenka! Nastenka!

246
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:41,297
Come here!

247
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:47,703
You viper!

248
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:54,262
Nastenka, my sweetie,
my honeycomb!

249
00:35:55,427 --> 00:35:57,462
Show up to our guests.

250
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:03,864
This one is no good at all.

251
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,463
She's a scarecrow in the mall!

252
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:14,462
Our little fool is neither pretty,
norfull. Takes after herfather.

253
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:18,859
l keep mum...

254
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:23,374
What can l offeryou?

255
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:26,780
Fish or meat,
we're thankful for it.

256
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:30,180
My dear son
adores goose giblets.

257
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,617
Nastka!

258
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:38,771
Let your lovely daughter
take care of it.

259
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:43,172
And we'll see
how good she is at work.

260
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,611
-Are you sweating, dear?
- lt's mighty hot.

261
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,539
- Can you see a ramshackle hut?
- l'm seeing it.

262
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,856
That's my palace.

263
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,016
Come on down! Faster!

264
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:09,775
Here we are!

265
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:15,088
Here it is, my palace.
Thank you, handsome!

266
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:19,614
Are you laughing at me?

267
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:23,091
Can't you see how handsome l am?

268
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:25,253
No, l can't.

269
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:30,366
lt's been about 10 years
since l went blind.

270
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:33,455
l wish l have gone blind.

271
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:38,694
Granddad Mushroom lied to me.

272
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,012
l'll never look at myself again!

273
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:50,690
How is the bride?

274
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,851
He likes her a lot.

275
00:37:53,055 --> 00:37:56,683
Fair and bonny, she's not phoney.

276
00:37:58,494 --> 00:37:59,643
Mommy!

277
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:12,850
- Marfoushka! Daughter!
- Help!

278
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:26,600
Save me, quick!

279
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:34,368
You should've tied it tighter!

280
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,166
Are you rejecting my child?

281
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,082
Why?

282
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:46,848
He is a young lad,
and readyto wed.

283
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,603
But not this one!

284
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,926
The other one!

285
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:08,924
The one called Nastenka.

286
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:39,754
How can Grannywalk
without her stick?

287
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:43,441
l've got to take it to her!

288
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:47,998
Good boy, lvanushka!

289
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:59,752
Maybe l'mjust dreaming,
maybe l'm seeing ghosts,

290
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:03,590
or it's the old sorcerer's tricks
at theirworst.

291
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,759
The feather had brought me here.

292
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,837
Here l met Nastenka.

293
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,756
Look, the stump is blooming!

294
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:30,076
The evil sorcerer
is playing tricks on me.

295
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:33,156
l'll never be free of his spell.

296
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:46,515
So, there's only one choice...

297
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:51,348
Farewell, Nastenka!

298
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,352
Nastenka!

299
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,990
Manyweeks had passed,
the sky's with snow overcast!

300
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:17,664
The old man took his daughter
to the forest, 'cause he ought to.

301
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:22,901
Not of his own free will,
on the old woman's grill.

302
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:26,992
She nagged him!
She scolded him!

303
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:31,151
She pecked him!
She moulded him!

304
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:33,907
l tryto get Marfoushka married,

305
00:41:34,112 --> 00:41:36,148
but everybody looks
at Nastya, the weird.

306
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,348
Take herto the woods
and dump her!

307
00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:40,508
Out of my sight, wicked viper!

308
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:05,138
l don't care ifthe old nag
kills me,

309
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,348
but l'm not leaving you
in the forest, believe me.

310
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,985
Come on, Zorka! Turn back home!

311
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:23,745
Let her beat me with a poker,
orwith a pitchfork.

312
00:42:23,947 --> 00:42:26,984
l'm not afraid of her anymore!

313
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:32,340
l'm not afraid of anyone!
l'll tell herwhat l think!

314
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:41,413
She'll make you miserable, dad,
she will drive you mad.

315
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,743
Goodbye, daddy.

316
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,141
Remember me well.

317
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,981
Nastya!

318
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,134
C'mon, Zorka, go!

319
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,736
Hey, you in the house, move up!

320
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,898
Open the doors wide!

321
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,488
- Mommy!
-What?

322
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,650
That's enough!
l'm not putting up with...

323
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:50,812
l'm keeping mum...

324
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:55,973
Marfoushka, go back in,
you'll catch a cold, darling.

325
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:00,209
You'd betterwatch out!

326
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:06,055
Our Nastenka is gone...

327
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:33,328
Little hut, turn your back
to the forest, and yourface to me.

328
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:47,209
What do you want?

329
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:50,806
lvan?

330
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:54,209
We didn't expect you.

331
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:58,967
You turned the cabin,
disturbed the old lady.

332
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:02,402
lt was not to your heart
that it showed a wrong facade.

333
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:05,205
Don't be angry, Granny.

334
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:09,639
Help me to find Nastya
and save her.

335
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,048
Don't expect me to help.
You'd better run before you yelp.

336
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,725
Come on, little cabin!

337
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:22,885
Turn yourface to the forest
and your back to lvan.

338
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,127
Face me!

339
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:30,043
Back to lvan!

340
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,241
Back to the forest, face me!

341
00:45:33,088 --> 00:45:35,397
Face the forest, back to lvan!

342
00:45:40,287 --> 00:45:41,402
You hooligan!

343
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:44,964
lt will be myway!
Cabin, face me!

344
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,358
- Face me!
- Face me!

345
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:02,722
lt won't be yourwayfor long!

346
00:46:03,005 --> 00:46:06,314
Do not rely on your strength.

347
00:46:06,524 --> 00:46:10,199
You'll use strength,
l'll use magic!

348
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,198
Be brave, Hercules!

349
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:44,872
One! Two!

350
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,878
This way, you boaster,

351
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,787
You'll make a fine roaster!

352
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,872
No use, lvan, to fight,

353
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,717
don't show all your might.

354
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:14,909
l'll have you for dinner anyway.

355
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:18,109
- l didn't mean it.
-You didn't?

356
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:21,713
l've never been put on a shovel.

357
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:27,395
Show me
howto sit on a shovel.

358
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:28,871
Get down.

359
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:36,307
The young people oftoday.
What do theyteach you at school?

360
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:39,315
There's nothing tricky about it.

361
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:41,790
Good riddance!

362
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:49,790
Beat it,
before l turn you to kindling!

363
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:52,983
You rotten stuff!

364
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:06,301
Have mercy, lvanushka,
l'm sizzling, l'm hot!

365
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,188
A steambath never hurts, Granny.

366
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:14,027
Tell me, witch, where's Nastya?

367
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:17,309
How can l save Nastenka?

368
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:20,300
Hang in, Granny, hang it.

369
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:37,106
The firtree thrives and grows,

370
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,943
And laughs at winter snows.

371
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:42,868
ln summer sun and winter cloud

372
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:45,536
Stands the fir, green and proud.

373
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,105
The gales ofwinter blow sing:

374
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:56,702
''Sleep, little firtree,

375
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:06,775
''Sleep till spring.''

376
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,290
Where'd that marvel come from?

377
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:17,697
From home.

378
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,127
Are you warm, girlie?

379
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:27,695
l'm warm, Father Frost.

380
00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:42,536
And now, are you warm?

381
00:50:42,736 --> 00:50:47,685
l'm warm, dear Frost.
l'm warm, Father Frost.

382
00:50:50,336 --> 00:50:54,453
That's a good girl,
a very agreeable girl.

383
00:50:56,135 --> 00:51:00,526
Take my coat, dear.

384
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:05,610
And you, won't you be cold?

385
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:06,963
Me, cold?

386
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,571
A bird!

387
00:51:22,972 --> 00:51:24,690
Don't bother, girl.

388
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:27,008
Don't bother, dear.

389
00:51:27,332 --> 00:51:31,529
ln my scepter lies the power
that spreads the frost.

390
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:34,291
You're wicked, you're cruel.

391
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:39,087
l do pitythis little bird, too.

392
00:51:40,571 --> 00:51:46,088
But whoevertouches my scepter,
will neverwake up again.

393
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,768
-What's the matter, girl?
- Goodbye, Father Frost.

394
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:55,006
-What's the matter, dear?
- l'm freezing.

395
00:51:55,489 --> 00:52:00,687
Hey, myfast-running sleigh!
Hey, my magic ice sleigh!

396
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:13,596
C'mon, don't get cold, dear.

397
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:22,845
We are yet to dance
at yourwedding.

398
00:52:24,926 --> 00:52:26,678
Ho ho ho, myfast slegh!

399
00:52:50,483 --> 00:52:52,951
Feeling warmer, sweetheart?

400
00:53:00,322 --> 00:53:05,157
Nastenka...Love...Rubbish!

401
00:53:08,122 --> 00:53:13,832
Foryou not to get cold,
have a sheepskin coat.

402
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:24,078
Right! Bless your heart.

403
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,673
What?

404
00:53:39,318 --> 00:53:45,917
This sleigh is fast,
magically self-propelled.

405
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:50,986
lt will ride by itself,
will get you to Nastya herself.

406
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:59,668
The coat is almost new.
Don't forget to return it.

407
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:21,745
A nastytrick l've played on him!

408
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:27,148
Oh, howtired l am!

409
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:37,591
My back is killing me.

410
00:54:56,951 --> 00:54:58,508
Whoa! My good sleigh!

411
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:16,098
Oh, l feel so bad!

412
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:20,261
lt's neitherfever, nor a cold.

413
00:55:20,468 --> 00:55:23,744
lt's not an illness that wastes me,

414
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:27,496
lt's a wickedness that drains me.

415
00:55:31,187 --> 00:55:36,659
l can't sleep any more,
l can't eat any more.

416
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:42,663
This stranger hurt me,
poor Baba Yaga.

417
00:55:46,466 --> 00:55:50,663
l wanted to eat him,
but couldn't swallow.

418
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:55,416
lnstead l myself
ended up on a shovel.

419
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:06,734
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat,
come and have a little pat.

420
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:12,583
You've gotten silken fur,
you utter a giant purr.

421
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:18,572
You got to help me, you know,
run flying overthe snow.

422
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:21,979
And ruin lvan's bride!

423
00:56:29,941 --> 00:56:33,820
Nowwe'll have a laugh!

424
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:47,252
Don't worry, little girl.
Everything'll be all right.

425
00:57:47,453 --> 00:57:50,411
He will neverforget you.

426
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:54,562
Now l'll go and have a walk,

427
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:57,491
checking on the forest's stock.

428
00:57:57,692 --> 00:57:59,250
See if everything is in order.

429
00:58:00,452 --> 00:58:02,886
And you stay in charge here.

430
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:09,408
Don't feel lonely.
l'll be back soon.

431
00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:33,045
ls Nastenka in trouble?

432
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:38,236
Where are you going?
Get back!

433
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,242
Pussy-cat!

434
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:19,243
Where are you going?

435
00:59:26,003 --> 00:59:32,033
Whoevertouches my scepter,
will neverwake up again.

436
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,637
This will not do.
We must sprinkle you with frost.

437
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:07,033
Oh, what a dimwit l am!
l'mjust an old ham.

438
01:00:07,279 --> 01:00:11,397
l've left myfreezing scepter
at home.

439
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:26,950
Hello! Who lives in this house?

440
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,953
Who will open up for me?

441
01:00:31,677 --> 01:00:34,634
lt's me, Nastenka, l'm back.

442
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:46,154
Nastenka, dear girl!

443
01:00:48,675 --> 01:00:52,508
What a dimwit l am!
l'mjust an old ham.

444
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:55,869
l couldn't watch over Nastenka.

445
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,025
Well?

446
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,627
Good foryou!

447
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:46,106
l'll reward you the witch way.

448
01:01:53,748 --> 01:01:58,617
Forthis kitty,
the cream, rich and meaty.

449
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:03,217
You've earned it, Blackey.

450
01:02:14,906 --> 01:02:18,945
And forthis red devil,
the ham all deviled.

451
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:22,622
You've earned it, Reddy.

452
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:53,700
Hello, lvan, a widow's son!

453
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:56,538
Hello, Grandfather Frost.

454
01:02:56,742 --> 01:02:59,460
Have you come for Nastenka?

455
01:03:20,899 --> 01:03:22,378
Nastenka!

456
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,535
She's asleep.

457
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,447
Why's she sleeping at daytime?

458
01:03:31,978 --> 01:03:35,209
She's sleeping at nightime, too.

459
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:41,133
Forgive me, Nastenka,

460
01:03:41,337 --> 01:03:44,090
for having hurt yourfeelings.

461
01:03:45,657 --> 01:03:47,215
Please, forgive me!

462
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:31,442
lvanushka, how nice you're now!

463
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:34,769
-Am l really?
- Nicerthan you had been.

464
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:36,769
l've changed.

465
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,201
l used to be selfish.

466
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:43,609
Now l'm ready
to do good deeds.

467
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:48,042
-What is it on your cheek?
-What is there?

468
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,529
lt looks like
the bearfur's growing again.

469
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,604
l wasjustjoking, lvanushka.

470
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:19,517
Begone! Vanish!

471
01:05:20,567 --> 01:05:23,843
You cheats! You spongers!

472
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,760
What shall we do?

473
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:35,522
Let's try it!

474
01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:56,442
The other old men're stupid, too,
but you're the limit.

475
01:05:56,643 --> 01:05:59,441
To drag your own daughter
to the forest!

476
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:03,113
To amuse Grandfather Frost,
to feed a pack ofwolves.

477
01:06:04,243 --> 01:06:05,961
l'm mum, l'm mum.

478
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:11,680
l used to pull her by her braid,
and mywhole daywas made.

479
01:06:11,882 --> 01:06:18,195
You've got no hairto speak of,
nothing to get hold of.

480
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,632
lt's all yourfault, that l hit
my darling, you dolt!

481
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,592
And if Nastka were here...

482
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,357
They are coming!

483
01:07:23,595 --> 01:07:27,906
This is myfiancee, lvanushka.

484
01:07:31,794 --> 01:07:34,592
l'll explain, dearfather.

485
01:07:34,793 --> 01:07:40,186
Jack Frost me traced
and welcomed to his place.

486
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:43,832
He had me with lvan betrothed,

487
01:07:44,033 --> 01:07:46,262
With a rich dowry me endowed.

488
01:07:47,312 --> 01:07:49,667
Real precious stones!

489
01:07:50,392 --> 01:07:51,711
lsn't the bridegroom handsome!

490
01:07:52,032 --> 01:07:55,182
Nastenka is a real princess!

491
01:07:55,631 --> 01:07:58,350
And Marfoushka looks like
a bag of potatoes!

492
01:08:00,231 --> 01:08:04,667
Get out of here!
And never come back!

493
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,588
l'll showyou a bag of potatoes!
l'll teach you a lesson!

494
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:17,178
l want a fiancee!
l want precious stones!

495
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:21,983
So, to Marfoushka's wishes,
on the old woman's orders,

496
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:25,186
the old man took Marfoushka
to the forest

497
01:08:25,388 --> 01:08:28,983
and left her under a tall firtree.

498
01:09:04,224 --> 01:09:06,658
Are you warm, girlie?

499
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:13,978
Are you crazy, old man?

500
01:09:14,223 --> 01:09:17,181
Can't you see that
my hands and feet are frozen?

501
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:21,657
Who is this weird creature?

502
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:30,658
Are you warm, girl?

503
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:41,180
Bring on myfiancee,
and my dowry, too.

504
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:43,974
A real big dowry!

505
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,494
That's better!

506
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:54,058
Sleep, oh bears, in your lairs,
spend a quiet night.

507
01:09:57,099 --> 01:10:01,889
The fox lies low
beneath the snow.

508
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:08,650
ln the tree sits
the nest ofthe crow.

509
01:10:08,858 --> 01:10:13,806
But the bandit's lair
isn't anywhere.

510
01:10:14,217 --> 01:10:19,655
We are cold all!
We are hungry all!

511
01:10:24,296 --> 01:10:27,174
Silence! Take your positions!

512
01:10:27,616 --> 01:10:31,404
We are going to rob!

513
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,847
Look!

514
01:10:47,574 --> 01:10:50,372
Here comes the granny.

515
01:10:53,373 --> 01:10:55,887
Fresh like a new penny.

516
01:10:58,093 --> 01:11:02,404
Woodland pundits,
robber bandits!

517
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,251
Howwould you like...

518
01:11:05,492 --> 01:11:06,481
What?

519
01:11:06,692 --> 01:11:11,321
Two tubs of gold nuggets,
six pails of sterling ingots,

520
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:15,206
all the copper l've got
for a piece of cakejob.

521
01:11:16,491 --> 01:11:18,243
All right!

522
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:27,800
Copperwill do forthem,
and you will get gold.

523
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,570
But only afteryou do yourjob.

Don't you trust us?

525
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:35,804
Don't you trust me to trust you?

526
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:38,160
Quiet now!

527
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:54,711
All right, you scoundrels,
yours is an easyjob.

528
01:12:55,481 --> 01:13:01,555
Coming through this site
will be lvan and his bride.

529
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,957
Them you must capture,

530
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,555

531
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,158

01:13:41,676 --> 01:13:43,632
Hold on, Nastenka!

533
01:13:48,076 --> 01:13:50,031
Good work, isn't it?

534
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:58,552
-Where's our gold?
-Just hold.

535
01:14:02,434 --> 01:14:06,143
Robbed an old lady, spongers!

536
01:14:13,353 --> 01:14:14,581
Surrender, lvan!

537
01:14:14,793 --> 01:14:17,307
Oryou'll payforthe shovel!

538
01:14:19,992 --> 01:14:21,141

539
01:14:31,191 --> 01:14:34,228

Those are our clubs!

543
01:15:39,984 --> 01:15:41,940
Look out, lvanushka!

544
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:45,460
-You old witch!
- Take pity on the poor granny!

545
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:48,417
No pityforyou!

546
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:10,695
Nastenka got a trunk
and a box ofjewels.

547
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:17,135
But Marfoushka'll get 4 trunks
and two boxes ofjewels.

548
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:21,769
No, she'll get fourtrunks
and four boxes.

549
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:29,208
For Nastenka he found a peasant,

550
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:32,695
but for Marfoushka
he is sure to get a prince.

551
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:36,127
They are coming!

552
01:17:18,974 --> 01:17:21,124
Where's your dowry?

553
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,369

01:18:32,327 --> 01:18:36,604
To the wedding l came,
drank ale, ate game.

557
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:41,596
The bride and groom were
the loveliest couple in the land.

558
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:44,714
And here our storywill...

559
