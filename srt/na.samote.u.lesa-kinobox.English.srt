1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,476  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come on, you need your vitamins!

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,190  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
- A titchy Trabant overtook us.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,348  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Did I shut the sitting-room window?

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,199  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Old cow can't keep to the sidewalk...!

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,793  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:515
- I shut it, Mom!

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,552  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Good girl, and the kitchen?

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,710  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:448 Y2:510
- That too.
- Good.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,110  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Does a worm have a head?
- A worm?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,476  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:515
Not a head, but a front and back.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,869  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:485 Y2:516
Presents

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,395  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:510
We're not taking them a present.
- Never mind.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,438  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
- How d'you know which is the front?
- Of what?

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,149  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
- The worm.
- According to the way it's crawling.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,917  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What if it's reversing?
- Worms don't reverse.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,150  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
A black car wouldn't be pretty.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,077  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
- In summer...
- A Trabant overtaking!

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,277  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:510
- It would be hot...
...in a black car.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,191  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Is a worm a snake?

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,236  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:515
- No, it's a worm.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,074  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Another Trabant overtaking, Dad!
- Snakes are larger!

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,109  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:510
In the film

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,433  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
What if it's a big worm?

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,397  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:510
- It's still a worm.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,994  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Clean up, Susie, you're all sticky!

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,355  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What if it's this big?

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,829  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:516
- It's still a worm.
- And this big?

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,388  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:448 Y2:510
- A worm!
Idiot!

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,990  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Who, Dad?
- That Fiat could have passed.

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,029  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:510
A COTTAGE BY THE WOOD

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,076  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hm. Now you remember...!

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,229  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
Story and Screenplay by

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,319  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
You said no Trabant
would ever overtake you, Dad!

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,516  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Wait till we're out of town...!

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,119  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I didn't take the thermos.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,992  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
- He's crying, Mummy!

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,155  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What's the matter?

37
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,800  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I don't understand.
- What?

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,838  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:510
- You said a snake was bigger
than a worm.

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,835  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
- It is.
- A worm this big must be a snake!

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,955  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
- All right, so it's a snake,
and stop bothering me!

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,555  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:515
Visitors, Radim!

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,154  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:510
A double nil!

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,149  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:510
Who?
- The Lavickas.

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,515  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where's the stork you told us about?

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,079  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Here, children.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,398  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
Storks build nests near ponds.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,080  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Welcome!

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,151  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Excuse the dust.
A mill's a mill...

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,039  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, kids?

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,156  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Good morning, Mr. Zvon!

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,789  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Here I'm called The Miller!

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,316  X1:181 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
I had that wheel made.
But it looks antique, what?

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,550  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Children, the wheel is imitation.

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,949  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But the balustrade is original.

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,517  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Really, Radim...

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,273  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We try to keep up the traditions.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,713  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:510
So this is a mill.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,957  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is where they ground the flour.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,995  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
The grain was poured in there.

60
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,196  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You see, children,
the grain went in there,

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,840  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:516
was ground here.
- Mind your heads!

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,399  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mind your heads!

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,554  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
- That's the groats mill,
the plain flour mill,

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,915  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:515
the peeling mill.
- So, children!

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,549  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
The groats mill, the plain flour mill,
the wheeling mill.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,751  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Peeling!
- Peeling.

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,355  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Groats were used to feed pigs with.

68
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,318  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Groats were fed to piggies.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,757  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Here the flour sacks were stacked.
- All this is flour?

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,789  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I put in sawdust,
but the sacks are original.

71
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,756  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll show you something, children!

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,230  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:510
When the water-level gets high,
we'll ask the Miller

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,592  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:510
to set the wheel in motion.

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,474  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:516
- And I'll tell you an interesting story

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,075  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
about the local water-sprite
and how he helped the Miller

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,798  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
fight the local squire.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,949  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whenever I tell that story people say:
,, You must tell us again!".

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,675  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:510
The groats went in here, the flour here,
and here the semolina.

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,871  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Attention, children!
This was for groats,

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,474  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:515
this for flour, this for semolina,

81
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,352  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:515
and this for double zero flour I guess?
- No, that's the toilet.

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,951  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
But I refuse to keep animals.

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,633  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
We had a dog...

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,599  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
...that kept barking.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,558  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What kind of dog?

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,199  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Harry.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,076  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:516
I got rid of him.

88
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,155  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:516
A cottage is difficult to find nowadays.

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,840  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
Easier said than done!

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,590  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
Maybe Kos would know of one.

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,036  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
How's life?

92
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,115  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,395  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Ah, the Miller!

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,718  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
What an honour!
- Getting on with it, I see!

95
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,268  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We never stop.

96
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,316  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You're building it yourselves?

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,992  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:484 Y2:510
- No.

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,958  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
We've got a bricklayer.

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,035  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
He charges ten crowns an hour.
A good one, and cheap!

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,078  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Ten crowns?!
- A rarity nowadays!

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,555  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What was this originally?

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,753  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:510
- A barn.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,950  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:516
I left only the foundations!

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,913  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:510
- You sure remodelled it!

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,959  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Comes more expensive this way,

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,194  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
but you have what you want.
Where you want it.

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,349  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:484 Y2:516
Whether it's a doorway, stairs, bedroom,

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,355  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
kitchen, bathroom, yes,

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,473  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
living room, garage,

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,958  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
toilet, pantry,

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,597  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:515
cellar, hall, bath!

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,069  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:448 Y2:511
- Yes, it's true!
Quite a villa!

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,919  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
- The amount of building material
this eats up, though!

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,357  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:515
- The sand, lime, cement...
- Look, Radim!

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,911  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:510
...Bricks, shaped ones...
- Nice!

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,834  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
...lintel, trusses,
I don't have them here yet,

117
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,190  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
nails, screws, wiring...

118
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,593  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:515
drains, tiles...

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,953  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:516
pipes, binding!

120
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,469  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:516
You've got your twin leads,
triple leads, guttering, sheeting...

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,669  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Problems...!

122
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,709  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
...an electricity meter,
a lighting conductor,

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,789  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
switch and wiring boxes...

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,836  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You understand all these things?

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,150  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We've got this bricklayer.

126
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,154  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
The cheapest man around.

127
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,830  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
Asks only 10 Crowns an hour!

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,117  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:510
Including transport and food!
- Where's the mortar?!

129
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,760  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Coming right up!
Here it comes, Mr. Lawrence!

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,719  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:515
Kids...!

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,158  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:510
Enough sand in it?
- Too thin!

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,357  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:510
- And now?

133
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,238  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:484 Y2:510
- O.K.

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,278  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He can't hold a brick,
but he's a real expert!

135
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,277  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
- He's an expert!

136
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,396  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
He's built three big houses here
this way!

137
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,633  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Listen, Robert.
The Lavickas are looking for a cottage.

138
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,188  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:516
Would you know of anything?

139
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,077  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:516
- A cottage?

140
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,950  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:510
- These kids of ours...
- Fresh air for them...

141
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,869  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:516
- But something habitable,
no remodelling job.

142
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,631  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:510
Because von Olda is...

143
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,359  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Can I manage these?
...not the type for building work!

144
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,119  X1:327 X2:391 Y1:484 Y2:510
- No.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,989  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
- It needn't be big.
Just - away from it all.

146
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,353  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:448 Y2:510
- And now?
- Yes.

147
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,757  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Some place good for the children.

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,358  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Yeah, a cottage.

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,991  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:510
What about that one over there?

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,957  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:516
It should be up for grabs by the autumn.

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,110  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
Old Ma Jerabkova's sinking fast,

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,112  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
it should be free by Christmas.

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,590  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Breathe deeply, Susie,
so your chest expands!

154
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,910  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:516
- So you could have that
when she goes.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,629  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
But it's probably damp.

156
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,711  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:516
Maybe that one would be better,

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,358  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:510
with the red roof.
- Which one?

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,555  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:516
- There, the red roof
with the white gable.

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,631  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Do you know which one?
The one with the wooden barn.

160
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,676  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:515
- The Cervenkas live there,

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,352  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:516
a motorbike ran over him last year.

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,032  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
And he's in pretty bad shape,

163
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,792  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
won't be here long either.

164
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,552  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
She's going blind,

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,473  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
will be going to a Home for the Aged.

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,269  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:516
But that's right in the village. You
probably wouldn't like it there either.

167
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,074  X1:172 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hey! Did you ask Komarek?
- Over by the wood?

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,310  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Yes, that's it.
Go and ask him!

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,279  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
He wants to move to Slovakia,
to join his son.

170
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,555  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's all getting too much for him,

171
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,269  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
the milking, the feeding,

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,156  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
the cleaning, the chopping,
the cooking,

173
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,758  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
the loading, unloading,

174
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,192  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
the ploughing, the sowing...
- What a lovely place!

175
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,513  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:516
- God help ye!
- Thank ye kindly!

176
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,272  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:510
- God bless you!
- Hello!

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,510  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Good afternoon!

178
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,354  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mowing, are you?

179
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,876  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mowing, that's right.

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,710  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Coming along all right?
- Yeah, it is.

181
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,115  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Nice place.

182
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,589  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:484 Y2:510
- That it is.

183
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,715  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
- How old are you, friend?
- Seventy.

184
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,673  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Wow, that's something!
- Nice, isn't it?

185
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,150  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I say!
- You don't look your age!

186
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,118  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You live alone, Mr. Komarek?
- Yes, yes.

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,112  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:510
- His hearing's bad, you must shout
at him.

188
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,152  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:510
Do you live alone?
- I do.

189
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,599  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We hear you have a son in Slovakia!

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,395  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
- In Presov.
- Don't you miss them?

191
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,474  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
- If you miss them?

192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,199  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They're asking if you miss them?

193
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,158  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I hear you, but I don't know!

194
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,152  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But this is a lovely spot.

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,238  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Ask him straight out
if he'd consider moving to Slovakia,

196
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,675  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
and letting them have the cottage.

197
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,877  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You want the cottage?

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,675  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:515
- We would consider it,
we like it here, what?

199
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,834  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We haven't seen it inside yet!

200
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,669  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Come and look, then!

201
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,629  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
A lovely spot!

202
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,353  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
- A fairy-tale cottage.

203
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,317  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
- We'll be quite envious, won't we,
Radim?

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,672  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Peter, don't cut yourself!

205
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What's your dog's name?
- Isha.

206
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,594  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
- May I stroke him?

207
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,150  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:510
- He's never hurt a soul.
- Isha!

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,197  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Kids!

209
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,918  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The quiet...

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,598  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't step in that, Peter.
- Like a picture!

211
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,349  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
- So romantic!
- Come along in.

212
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,954  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
- An old Czech idyll!

213
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,552  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:515
- I have some stuff in here!
But I'd clear it out,

214
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,029  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:510
restuff the straw mattresses and...

215
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,350  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
...you'd have a nice room
for your vacations!

216
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,838  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
- It's very damp, Olda!
- It's not that bad.

217
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,670  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
Just needs more airing
to make a pretty room.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,592  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
- See, damp and rotten!

219
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,118  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Well, a couple of planks need
replacing.

220
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,633  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
- A very nice place you have.

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,154  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Cozy, what?

222
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,950  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:510
- How does it flush?
- Just leave it!

223
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,669  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Beneath the rustic beams
of yeasteryear...

224
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,831  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
- That's right.

225
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,992  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Are there mice?
- Why would there be mice?

226
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,356  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
- It really breathes rustic poetry...

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,351  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:510
- It's mildew I smell.

228
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,159  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Why would there be mildew?

229
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,670  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Come here!

230
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,076  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:516
- At least 100 years old, this.

231
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,756  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Older, chum.

232
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,589  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What a pretty wardrobe!

233
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,230  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Let's buy it.
- Yes.

234
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,949  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
Heavens, Mr. Komarek, when did you
last wash your dishes?

235
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,555  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:516
- When I run out of pots,
I do it in one go.

236
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,550  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Let's get it done, Vera!

237
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,954  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:515
Mr. Komarek,

238
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,040  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:515
what about...
- Get out, beast!

239
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,793  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll tie her up.

240
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,996  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mr. Komarek, what would you say to

241
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,390  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
letting the room to the Lavickas,

242
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,388  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:510
for weekends and vacations?

243
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,755  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
What do you say?
- O.K.

244
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,795  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:448 Y2:510
A musician from Prague used to spend
his time here.

245
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,155  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:510
And he loved it here!

246
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,678  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:510
That viola is his.

247
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,233  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:510
I keep waiting for him to fetch it,
I've waited and waited.

248
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,758  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
But he'll be coming.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,229  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:510
- When did he leave it here?

250
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,072  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Wait, when...?

251
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,674  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
During the first... World War.

252
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,757  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:516
Beams, planks,

253
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,352  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:484 Y2:515
tiles...

254
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,513  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
Damn!

255
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,911  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, they would be here with you,

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,357  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
and when you decide to sell out,
you'd make them the first offer.

257
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,109  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What would the monthly rent be,
now?

258
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,033  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
- How much would you care to pay?

259
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,558  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What about a hundred?

260
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,070  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
- O.K.
To cover the insurance and things.

261
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,549  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:515
- And a bottle or so, what?

262
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,991  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:516
- And when would you think of selling?

263
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,230  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Well...
- Mr. Lavicka is asking...

264
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,914  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I heard!
- When do you think?

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,755  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I'd bring in the harvest,
sell the cow in winter

266
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,029  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:516
and do no more sowing in spring.

267
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,272  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:516
Say 'please'!

268
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,952  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where's your cap?

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,558  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Forgot it.

270
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,677  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:516
Go!
- He forgot his cap!

271
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,118  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're sitting on it!
He's got it, Dad!

272
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,111  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, here we are.

273
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,758  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good morning!
- Good morning!

274
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,874  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:515
Heavens, what a lot of stuff!

275
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,110  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Here's something for you,
Mr. Komarek.

276
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,794  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:510
- But there was...
- Hello!

277
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,791  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Hello!
There was no need...!

278
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,950  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
- We've arrived, Isha!
- Good morning!

279
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,758  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Welcome!

280
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,110  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:510
- May we auntie Isha, Grandad?
- No!

281
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,236  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Susie, don't be cheeky,

282
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,356  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:510
Mr. Komarek isn't our Grandad.
- Just let them be!

283
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,476  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm a Grandad anyway, so what...

284
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,357  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
But leave the dog on the chain!

285
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,159  X1:152 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
He'd get used to running about
and would't want to go back

286
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,989  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
to his kennel.
- I hope he hasn't got fleas.

287
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,878  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He'll have a flea or two.
But they're dog fleas,

288
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,632  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
they leave people alone!

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,150  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good morning!
- Good morning!

290
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,515  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:510
- This is Tony.
He catches snakes.

291
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,068  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
- There are snakes here?
- I should say!

292
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,469  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I summer, mostly.
Vipers, too.

293
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,193  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Do they nest here?

294
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,033  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Not here!
In the wood, or on the paths.

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,590  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You're preparing the floor?
How kind of you!

296
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,189  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Tony's a handy chap.

297
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,910  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll show you how he catches them.

298
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,558  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:516
- How do you do it?

299
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,037  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Tell them how you do it!

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,475  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:516
- There's nothing to it!

301
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,472  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Say how you catch them!

302
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,312  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
- In my hand!

303
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,516  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Aren't you afraid they'll bite you?

304
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,192  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They won't bite me.

305
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,236  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I guess you wear gloves.

306
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,959  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:516
- No, I catch them with my bare hands.

307
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,156  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:448 Y2:510
- A viper?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,559  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't try telling me you take
a poisonous viper in your bare hand!

309
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,673  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:510
- He does.
I've seen him.

310
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,673  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
Look!

311
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,353  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
When I see a viper...
- Just wait a moment!

312
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,670  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:515
Children, come here!

313
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,749  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:510
This gentleman catches poisonous vipers
with his bare hands!

314
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,474  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:510
Listen to how he does it!

315
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,154  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:510
- But there's nothing to it.
- Do tell them!

316
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,594  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'd rather show you.

317
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,958  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
I want to start lunch.
I need my pots and pans.

318
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,429  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Not just now, Vera!

319
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,674  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:515
In summer I sweat,

320
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,153  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
and my jacket...
- Smells of the sweat.

321
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,873  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Smells.

322
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,111  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:510
The viper gets a shock.
- Gets a shock!

323
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,270  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Doesn't know what's happening.

324
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,433  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:510
I reach in for it

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,356  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
and my hand smells the same.

326
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,351  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:484 Y2:516
- And that's what scares the viper most.

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,749  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
And that's what scares the viper.

328
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,718  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:516
That's Tony!

329
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,276  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:510
- See? It doesn't bite.

330
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,350  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Unbelievable.

331
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,116  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:448 Y2:516
- So, Olda...
Excuse me, I have to do my cooking!

332
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,272  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:510
Where did you put the baking-pan?
- Unbelievable!

333
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,356  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:510
Do you know why a cow's useful?
- It eats flies.

334
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,636  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:516
- It gives us milk.

335
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,235  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I thought we buy milk.

336
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,116  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What's the cow's name?

337
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,589  X1:316 X2:402 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Cow.

338
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,390  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Can we call her Jitka?

339
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,948  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Yes, she won't care.

340
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,756  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Jitka!
- Cow!

341
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,875  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:516
Is that any use?

342
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,758  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Hey, the water's coming here down
the slope.

343
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,031  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
The wall can't breathe.

344
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,557  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'll lead the water off

345
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,478  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
and the damp must disappear.

346
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,235  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:516
Next time we come,
the wall will be dry.

347
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,868  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
You gave me a fright!

348
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,759  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Here!

349
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,235  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:516
Mr. Komarek!
What about felling down this plum-tree?

350
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,718  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:515
It's old, and it won't let the sun in.

351
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,394  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The plumes are always full of maggots.

352
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,552  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Goat! Goatee! Come here!
- I'd have guessed that.

353
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,589  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
- But when you put them in a barrel
the plums and maggots ferment...

354
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,155  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:510
and ah - the Slivovitz!

355
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,756  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:515
Wait, when it's ours!

356
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,792  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
The floor's repaired.
You can dance on it now.

357
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,395  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Wait, Mr. Hruska!
How much do we owe you?

358
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,833  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Oh, don't mention it.

359
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,196  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't give him anything.
He drinks up all he gots.

360
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,191  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Indeed, yes!

361
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,034  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
The work, the new planks...

362
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,633  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come on now... all right...

363
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,633  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Well, if you insist...

364
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,995  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Be seeing you!

365
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,239  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Why on earth did you give him
that money?

366
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,878  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
- For repairing the floor...

367
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,316  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Is it our floor?
- No, but it will be!

368
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,597  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
- That isn't sure yet.

369
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,875  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
And we pay our rent,

370
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,839  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:516
so it's his duty to mend the floor.

371
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,997  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
Olda! You mustn't be such a softie!
People see it straight away

372
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,230  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
and take advantage of it.

373
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,631  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:510
I know you're in love with the place,
but do think twice!

374
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,757  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
100 Crowns a month for such...
...a damp hole!

375
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,071  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Firstly
it's no damp hole,

376
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,116  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:516
secondly I'm getting the damp out

377
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,110  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
and thirdly...
- Good afternoon!

378
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,111  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
...I'm investing in my own property.

379
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,553  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!

380
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,029  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'm Ferry Kokes.

381
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,510  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
Would you lend me your spare tyre?
For an hour, to get to town with?

382
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,556  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Yes, of course.

383
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,791  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:515
Can't even shake hands,

384
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,633  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
look at the sight I am.

385
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,550  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Seven holes!
Hopeless trying to mend them!

386
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,352  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
Did she leave an egg?

387
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,950  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Not an egg.
- Pity.

388
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,551  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're practically neighbours.
- Really?

389
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,077  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes, really!
I've got a cottage here two years now.

390
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,753  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:515
I was mad about it,

391
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,910  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
so I bought it old man and woman
included.

392
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,831  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:516
They wanted to end their days here.

393
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,434  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now I've got strangers in the house
and I can't get rid of them.

394
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,635  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:515
Come and see us some time,

395
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,711  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:516
and thanks a lot!
Thank you!

396
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,312  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

397
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,719  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll bring it back tonight!

398
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,313  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:510
- There's no hurry!
- Seven holes.

399
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,833  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:510
And that was a second time!

400
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,031  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:516
Thank you.

401
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,872  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:516
I enjoyed that.

402
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,598  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Coffee's ready too.

403
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,790  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What's the time?
- It's past six.

404
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,348  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Oh, I'll have to be going!

405
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,158  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'll take the coffee with me.

406
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,912  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:510
Where's he going?
- I don't know.

407
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,319  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:516
Good evening.

408
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,351  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Once upon a time

409
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,477  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
there was a Kingdom
which was neither large nor small.

410
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,310  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
All its inhabitants were happy people.

411
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,515  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I haven't heard this one before!
Go on, I'm listening!

412
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,831  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
- The ruler of this Kingdom was
a very old King.

413
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,992  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I bet he has three sons.
- This King had three sons.

414
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,877  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Didn't I say so?

415
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,350  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
- One day he asked them

416
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,352  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
to find a really wise man.

417
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,958  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
The youngest son set out at once.

418
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,271  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:510
He went around the kingdom
from town to town

419
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,756  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
looking for a wise man.

420
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,594  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
But in that Kingdom people were
neither stupid nor clever,

421
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,636  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
neither ever nor good,
neither cowardly nor brave,

422
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,994  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
neither ugly nor beautiful.

423
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,673  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:448 Y2:510
Children!
Come here!

424
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,912  X1:313 X2:406 Y1:484 Y2:510
Listen!

425
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,877  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:516
Do you hear?
- Something tinkling.

426
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,394  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

427
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,631  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The angelus, or evening bell.

428
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,391  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:516
In the country they always ring a bell

429
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,948  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
at this time of evening.

430
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,349  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
- It's coming nearer, Dad!

431
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,749  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
- No, that's just the wind!

432
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,752  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
The bell is fixed up

433
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,879  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:516
in a bell tower
and the bell-ringer stands below

434
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,758  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:516
and pulls that bell.

435
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,070  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The bell-ringer's coming up, Dad!

436
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,239  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:515
- No, children, this is Mr. Lawrence.

437
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,836  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
But it really did sound
like the angelus.

438
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,358  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good evening.
- Good evening!

439
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,718  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Finished for the day?
- I put him to bed early,

440
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,756  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
so he's up bright and early.

441
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,956  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
And what about you?
How are you doing?

442
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,953  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We're not here long yet...

443
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,393  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Quite a job, if you ask me.

444
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,472  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
The first thing you'll need are

445
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,433  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:516
some decent tools.
A good hammer...

446
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,839  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't rock me!
...and pliers...

447
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,593  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
...a pipe cutter, a shovel...

448
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,274  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Stop rocking me!
...a spade, a pick-axe...

449
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,670  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:515
...a trowel, a water-level...

450
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,952  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:510
a wheel-barrow!

451
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,033  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:516
A screen...
- Stop rocking me!

452
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,113  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
...a gimlet, a chisel, a plane,

453
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,871  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:516
a vice, a file, a rasp...
- Supper!

454
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,472  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Excuse us, Mr. Kos,

455
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,835  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
...sandpaper, a big rake...
- we have to go - my wife...

456
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,512  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Come along!
...A small rake...

457
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,079  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, be seeing you. Goodbye.

458
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,071  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:510
And a frame saw!

459
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,357  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:510
Here I am!
- Come on!

460
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,552  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I'm not too late?
- No!

461
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,798  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:516
What's the time?
- A quarter to ten.

462
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,110  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Come and look, then!

463
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,434  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:510
You wouldn't believe me.

464
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,239  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's nearly ten
and they're still asleep.

465
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,875  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:510
Sometimes till twelve!

466
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,235  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
- How can they?
- The just do.

467
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,989  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, slept your fill?

468
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,640  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:510
- If you went to bed
when the chickens do...

469
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,517  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Can I bring in the eggs, Grandad?

470
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,637  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes, go and see if they've laid any.
- A bright boy!

471
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,233  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
- That he is.

472
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,270  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good morning!
- Good morning!

473
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,511  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I bet you do the old man's
shopping too?

474
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,432  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Well, of course...

475
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,636  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Don't over do the good relations bit!

476
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,554  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good morning!
- Better to keep your distance.

477
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,709  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let him be!
- Is he the owner?

478
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,677  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:510
- The former owner!

479
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,269  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:510
With water there he's more scare still.

480
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,158  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But surely, I'd like to...

481
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,992  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Just leave them alone.

482
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,832  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:516
I dug the hole because of them!

483
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,879  X1:125 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
They could have gone to a Home. - 
A lovely chateau it is!

484
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,110  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
But they refuse to budge.
Say they have it in writing.

485
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,155  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:510
So I sweeten it...
- Riffraff!

486
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,038  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:516
...up for them.

487
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,435  X1:304 X2:414 Y1:448 Y2:510
Thanks.
Thanks!

488
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,033  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm repairing the chimney,
nobody can stop me doing that.

489
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,792  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'll make life such hell for them...

490
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,429  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The pancakes are getting cold!

491
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,033  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
And you stand here gabbing...!

492
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,633  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:516
- My wife!

493
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,870  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good morning!
Goodbye!

494
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,190  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I'll smoke them out.

495
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,078  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:516
Drop in some time.

496
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,200  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, Grandad sowing.

497
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,714  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:515
- That's a farmer, Susie.

498
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,951  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
- But Grandad sows too.
Right!

499
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,913  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
- He sowed.

500
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,275  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's giving it up.

501
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,553  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll sell the cow and won't sow again.

502
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,390  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's pissing and pissing.

503
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,634  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mum! It's pissing and pissing.

504
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,790  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What are you saying?
- Grandad said it.

505
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,272  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:510
- So take a look!

506
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,316  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mr. Komarek can speak as he likes.

507
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,516  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
But no dirty words from you!

508
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,552  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:515
See, children?

509
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,315  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
These were lamps used in the past.
- In antiquity?

510
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,674  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What do you mean by antiquity?

511
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,399  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your grandfather still did his homework
in such a light.

512
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,711  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:515
- I would, too!

513
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,952  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You'd spoil your eyes!
- Did Grandfather spoil his eyes?

514
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,190  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Grandfather had a different problem.

515
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,714  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I hope we can put in electricity!

516
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,950  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But why?

517
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,918  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
It wouldn't be the thing in this
sort of cottage.

518
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,158  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
We'll furnish it in period style

519
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,913  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:516
and all our friends will envy us.

520
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,359  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:516
- For not having electricity...

521
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,873  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:484 Y2:516
Funny...

522
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,231  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:510
What was that?

523
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,231  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:510
- A hunt.

524
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,953  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I think somebody's arrived.

525
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,120  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Who'd be arriving...

526
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,959  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I don't know.

527
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,669  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
Chase those chickens out
and please go and look!

528
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,999  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
What are you doing?

529
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,996  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Trying to cut some firewood,

530
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,556  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:516
But the thing...

531
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,595  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:516
...keeps choking...

532
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,196  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Can't get it to run.

533
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,037  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Did this ever run?

534
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,714  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:516
- It'll run again!

535
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,712  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
Hruska said the magneto is weak.

536
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,959  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:510
Try turning the handle for me.
- Where? Here?

537
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,473  X1:310 X2:408 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Right.

538
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,239  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:510
- The cooler's cracked.

539
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,155  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:515
- We'll keep it filled.
Come on, now!

540
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,674  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
Keep turning!

541
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,639  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
Wait! We must heat the plug.

542
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,319  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:510
Now wait!

543
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,356  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
What on earth are you doing?

544
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,518  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
Keep turning!

545
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,596  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:484 Y2:516
Glory be!

546
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,596  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Bring some water, quick!

547
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,639  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's boiling!

548
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,399  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:484 Y2:516
More gas!

549
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,153  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:516
More! More gas!

550
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,198  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:516
When I'm cutting, you must turn it up!

551
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,958  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:516
Again!

552
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,439  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
Keep turning!

553
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,352  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
Water!

554
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,595  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:516
Water!
- Where's Daddy?

555
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,159  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Maybe he's branding a cow.

556
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,994  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Branding?
- Hurry!

557
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,838  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:516
- We're off to look for mushrooms.
Coming?

558
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,153  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're off to look for mushrooms.
Coming?

559
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,399  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
What?
...coming mushroom-hunting?

560
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,552  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'll catch you up.

561
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,068  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
Here, children! Quickly!

562
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,395  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:515
The ants built all this,

563
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,599  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:516
pine needle by pine needle,

564
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,799  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
with its ant highways...

565
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,350  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:510
See? Here's one now...
Iook.

566
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,120  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
- This ant's carrying rice!

567
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,714  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
- That's an egg, you silly.

568
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,518  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Egg?

569
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,632  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good day to you!
- Hello!

570
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,518  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're looking for mushrooms,
but they don't seem to be growing.

571
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,669  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Hello!
- Hello!

572
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,268  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:516
You have to get up earlier!

573
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,114  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
- We enjoy our sleep.
- I know, I saw you.

574
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,874  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Saw us?
- I just had a peep.

575
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,428  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:510
Komarek insisted.

576
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,829  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:516
There was a mayor

577
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,797  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:516
who slept that long,

578
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,031  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
but he had the sleeping-sickness!
- Who said...?

579
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,032  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:516
- The postman.
But you wouldn't know him.

580
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,712  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
He comes round at eight.

581
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,792  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Then we don't know him.

582
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,715  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:510
- This is awful!
He shows us off like a circus act.

583
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,270  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:510
- But the weather's on our side!

584
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,952  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The weather report said rain.

585
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,754  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's the last straw.

586
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,637  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But not us, hey Marta?

587
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,075  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:510
We like it here even when it rains.

588
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,119  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:515
Then the water wheel works,

589
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,749  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
and I'll tell you the story
about the water-sprite.

590
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,519  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
- This really is a lovely place.

591
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,398  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Do you know what we love best?

592
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,312  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The early mornings.

593
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,516  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes.

594
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,951  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
And the evenings.

595
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,238  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:510
We lie and listen

596
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,356  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:516
to the frogs tooting.

597
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,830  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:516
Such an unpleasant sound elsewhere.

598
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,798  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Here they just do:

599
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,996  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Higher, dear!

600
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,559  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:516
What do you do about mice?

601
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,076  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
Great, what?
- Are they for supper?

602
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,549  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes. Don't touch!

603
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,359  X1:109 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:516
Ask your Dad to bring some water in!

604
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,795  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:510
This oven bakes like a dream!

605
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,472  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I never tried baking.

606
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,870  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hasn't been used since the wife died.

607
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,438  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
She baked a good cake too.

608
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,193  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'm leaving them to cool,
then I'll ask you to taste them.

609
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,831  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:515
Does the water flow or...
- Quite, children!

610
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,595  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes, that's them!
Take the pail back, I want to talk

611
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,875  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:510
to Mr. Lawrence.

612
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,232  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:448 Y2:510
Water!
- Water!

613
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,754  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Aren't you good.

614
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,035  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mummy, look, the goat!

615
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,633  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Look how hungry she was.
- God, my cakes!

616
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,951  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Let go!
You beast!

617
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,959  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:448 Y2:516
Greedy thing!
Greedy! Goat!

618
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,035  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:510
Mr. Komarek, look at this!
Just look at this!

619
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,192  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What is it?
- Why don't you keep her tied up?

620
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,431  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:515
Ate six, bit into two.

621
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,799  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Damned glutton!
She's greedy, the devil!

622
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,749  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Our supper gone.
- Don't worry about me,

623
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,433  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'll finish those she started.
- Hardly enough for the children.

624
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,994  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Father gets a tin again.

625
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,671  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get out, you!
Get out, you!

626
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,470  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:516
Impossible,

627
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,869  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:516
life with the hen-coop and goat.

628
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,509  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Don't be cross. Taste this!

629
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,871  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:510
- No thanks.
- Come on!

630
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,473  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:515
Real cream, what?

631
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,119  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:510
Goat cream!

632
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,315  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's you, Mr. Komarek?

633
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,392  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
I didn't recognize you.

634
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,630  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You're a peach, Mr. Komarek!

635
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,712  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Well, a funeral, you know...

636
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,798  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Who died?
- Old Petrina.

637
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,950  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
He was ill for a long time.

638
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,674  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:515
Well, that's life.

639
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,549  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:515
Come and watch,

640
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,312  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
it'll be a grand funeral.

641
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,277  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:516
The priest is coming from Brod.

642
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,033  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We're not dressed for it.

643
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,157  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Mum! We want to see the funeral!

644
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,108  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We want to see a funeral!

645
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,758  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:510
- The children should see a funeral.

646
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,035  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Just watch!

647
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,429  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
You needn't join the procession!

648
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,796  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
We sing this at school.

649
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,632  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
Is it a funeral song?

650
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,792  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:516
- No, probably the deceased's favourite.

651
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,156  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Who is Mr. Deceased,

652
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,393  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
the one with the trumpet?

653
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,199  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No, no!
The one with the trumpet's a musician.

654
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,793  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:510
The 'deceased' is the one who died.

655
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,110  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:510
When somebody dies,
he's called the deceased.

656
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,476  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But why if that's not his name?

657
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,518  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:515
- He is deceased,

658
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,875  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:510
but his name is Petrina.

659
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,071  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mummy, he's crying.

660
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,958  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Don't cry, love!

661
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,196  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:515
He was old and ill,

662
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,555  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
and glad to die, see?

663
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,631  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:510
- But I don't understand.

664
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,430  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:515
- What?
- Who died, Mr. Petrina or Mr. Deceased?

665
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,680  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'll explain later.

666
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,199  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's a bit overgrown!

667
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,633  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:510
There's never time...

668
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,474  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Your wife died young.

669
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,233  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Not a single grey hair on her head!

670
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,520  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
A weak chest she had.

671
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,199  X1:148 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
I had,, When I Put the Horse out
to Pasture" played for her.

672
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,036  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
It was her song.

673
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,117  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll be going to the pub.

674
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,118  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:516
Well, goodbye!

675
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,191  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Goodbye!

676
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,997  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:510
Are they going to cry at the pub?
- No.

677
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,915  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:448 Y2:516
They buried him, played for him,
they can do no more for him,

678
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,117  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
that's life, now they can go

679
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,237  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:516
and enjoy themselves.

680
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,630  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't keep pinching bilberries,
so your mother sees

681
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,676  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:510
how rich the forests are.

682
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,671  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:510
- A mushroom!

683
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,276  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Typical!

684
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,113  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
Mum! Mum!

685
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,228  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mum!
- Mum!

686
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,598  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:510
Look how rich the forests are!

687
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,558  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You picked them all by yourself?

688
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,312  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Well, no...

689
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,797  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look at the garden Mummy made!

690
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,632  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
All by yourself?

691
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,349  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But the fence is your job!

692
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,753  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:516
You picked them by yourself, Peter?

693
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,432  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:510
Twice.
- How's that?

694
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,909  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I spilled them.

695
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,396  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:510
This'll be the scene
when we're all alone here.

696
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,068  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Will we do nothing but eat?

697
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,357  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:515
We'll eat and sunbathe,

698
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,351  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
and go swimming,

699
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,396  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
and paint the house...

700
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,040  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:510
- And fool around!
- That too.

701
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,952  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:510
It's ideal for the children.

702
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,952  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:516
I always won every fight, Tony.

703
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,395  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Not any more you don't.

704
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,150  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I always beat you!

705
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,149  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You wouldn't beat me today.

706
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,993  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You?
Every time!

707
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,152  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Not any more.

708
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,631  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes I would.

709
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,194  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:515
Come with us, forester.

710
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,759  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Where?
- Outside!

711
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,717  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Right.
- Let's go.

712
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,398  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Now you'll see something!

713
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,030  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
There's nothing to it!

714
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,838  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:510
- You've never tried!

715
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,559  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:510
- But I've seen it done.

716
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,272  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:515
Children, remember.

717
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,075  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
First speak to the animal,

718
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,595  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
so you don't frighten it.

719
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,955  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't be scared, old girl!

720
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,632  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Her name's Jitka.
- Don't be afraid!

721
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,439  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Your master's forgotten you,

722
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,431  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
but we'll help you.

723
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,355  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:510
Now I can sit,
because she knows about me.

724
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,598  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Jitka!
- Cow!

725
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,439  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No, don't be afraid, children!
She's not rearing...

726
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,718  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
...just chasing the flies off.

727
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,040  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:448 Y2:510
Komarek!
- Come on!

728
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,034  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get in there! Jenik!
- Don't give up!

729
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,953  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:510
Go on! Go on! Go on!

730
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,831  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
Jenik, get in there! Don't give up!

731
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,635  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Jenik, at him!
- At him!

732
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,350  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Jenik! Good, Jenik!

733
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,353  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mr. Komarek! Mr. Komarek!
- Here I am!

734
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,153  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Kick him!
- Don't be afraid of him, Tony!

735
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,952  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Give it to him!
- At him!

736
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,152  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:510
Shouldn't we fetch Mr. Komarek?

737
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,992  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Wait a moment!

738
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,557  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
This one's empty too.

739
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,159  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:515
He milked out two at lunchtime,

740
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,550  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:510
now I'll have to walk round

741
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,996  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:510
and do the other two.

742
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,510  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's it! That's it! Don't be afraid!

743
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,957  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:516
Empty, too.

744
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,550  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:516
So the situation has changed, children!

745
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,790  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:484 Y2:516
I think the delay turned her milk cheesy

746
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,555  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
and it stopped up the little holes.

747
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,389  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:510
Should have given him a Nelson!
- I did.

748
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,517  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Fancy me not noticing.
- It was that fast!

749
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,750  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good evening, Mr. Komarek.
You'll have to go home...

750
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,957  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Pity you didn't come sooner!
...your cow...

751
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,158  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Take a seat!
This is my Praguer.

752
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,118  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Hello. Kalous.
- Good evening. Lavicka.

753
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,952  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:515
- You two've met.
- Ah, Mr. Hruska.

754
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,951  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I beat him again!

755
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,911  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:510
This is Fiala.
- Lavicka.

756
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,149  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:510
I would not advise that.

757
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,868  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
Everybody with re...

758
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,228  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:510
...haired person
- Re... red...

759
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,951  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:484 Y2:510
- has ter...

760
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,995  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
...terribly.
- Terribly... bitter meat.

761
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,753  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes.
- Your tongue would...

762
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,989  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:516
...sting.

763
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,276  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Enough.

764
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,989  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
We sent the right messenger...!

765
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,948  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come, children!
Hold the light for me.

766
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,397  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:516
Daddy said...

767
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,438  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Daddy's done his milking, Susie.
Now I'll try!

768
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,236  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good night!
- You beat me, Johnny!

769
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,514  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Good night!

770
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,512  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good night, Tony! Good night!
- He beat him!

771
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,511  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Good night!

772
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,749  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:516
I slayed him!

773
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,278  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I wonder how you'd have got home,

774
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,511  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:516
had I not come to fetch you.

775
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,035  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What is it?
- A hole!

776
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,954  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:510
- There's another over there!

777
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,349  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:510
I made a mincemeat of Hruska.

778
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,193  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:510
Where are you?
- Here.

779
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,350  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:516
Have any matches, Mr. Komarek?

780
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,518  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes.

781
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,278  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Milk!

782
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,474  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Milk!

783
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,872  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:510
Have a taste!

784
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,998  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Can't...

785
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,039  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Haven't had a drink yet!

786
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,228  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I have.
- You have?

787
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,153  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Yes.
- Don't wake the children!

788
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,753  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Who did the milking?

789
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,314  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
- We did.
The children shone for me.

790
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,550  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:510
- The children shone!
- The children shone!

791
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,469  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:515
You in there, Mr. Komarek!
You here, Olda!

792
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,438  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They held the lamp!

793
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,552  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:516
They held the lamp.

794
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,910  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:510
What now?

795
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,356  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:516
- That's music.
He sure can play.

796
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,117  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Couldn't he wait till morning?

797
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,870  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I'll ask.

798
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,310  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:510
What do I ask?

799
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,358  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
- If he could wait till morning.
- Alright.

800
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,792  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:510
He can't.

801
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,751  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:516
- This is and awful holiday!

802
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,469  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
In the morning that old motor-saw,
at night he plays the violin.

803
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,590  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:510
- That's a viola.

804
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,149  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
He just says he'll sell the cow
and won't sow again next spring.

805
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,670  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
- It's impregnated,
but the damp could spoil it.

806
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,352  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
- But he's not doing anything.

807
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,874  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
- He's a slow country type, Vera!

808
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,473  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:516
It takes him a while to get into action.

809
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,358  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We made a basic mistake!

810
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,352  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
- What are you looking for, Radim?

811
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,872  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:515
- We wine and dine him,

812
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,520  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:516
do his errands by car,

813
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,670  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
we're company for him

814
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,832  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
and we pay rent;
he'd be crazy to move!

815
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,388  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Why not be friendly?

816
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,278  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:510
- We're overdoing it!
Look at Kokes...

817
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:48,992  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I'm not sure...!

818
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,799  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:510
Expect me to dig a hole
in front of his door too?!

819
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,759  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:510
- No! But we're practicing
the other extreme!

820
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,675  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
- It just needs more patience.

821
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,553  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:516
- And don't give him a break!

822
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,632  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:515
Keep asking him!
Has he written his son,

823
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,836  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:516
has he found a buyer for the cow!

824
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,559  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:484 Y2:516
And start wading through the red tape...

825
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,152  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mr. Miller, you promised to show us
the mill wheel

826
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,232  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
when there's enough water, and tell

827
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,916  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
that water-sprite story.
- Yes, the story.

828
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,799  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
Today's the day, then.

829
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,795  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now I'll tell you the story
of the water-sprite

830
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,235  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
who helped the miller.

831
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,956  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Remember we have children here!

832
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,191  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:515
- I know.
The miller stood here,

833
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,713  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
he set the thing going,

834
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,360  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
then he was fetched away...

835
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,590  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's only a legend, of course!

836
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,513  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'd love to hear that again

837
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,388  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
when it's quiet some time!

838
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,554  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:516
- So they want to hear it again too!

839
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,949  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
Everybody enjoys it!

840
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,196  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
Goat! You beast!

841
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,749  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:510
Goat! Goatee!

842
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,752  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where are you?

843
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,798  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come here!

844
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,990  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:510
Goat! Goatee!

845
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,317  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:516
Damned glutton!

846
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,748  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:515
Some idiot, Mr. Miller is.

847
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,397  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
No! Hey! Hey!

848
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,360  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:448 Y2:510
What is it?
- A flea!

849
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,316  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Some insect...

850
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,114  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I saw it jump in here.

851
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,316  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:516
- A little grass-hopper, maybe!

852
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,789  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Grass-hopper, my foot...!

853
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,196  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I'm itching, Mummy!
- So am I!

854
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,192  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Let me see!

855
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,390  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:510
Just look at this!
Look at this!

856
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,552  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:510
Your grass-hoppers!
- How could there be fleas?

857
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,631  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:516
- From the dog!

858
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,950  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
I told you it keeps scratching!

859
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,393  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Komarek said dog fleas

860
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,516  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
don't bother people!

861
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,716  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:510
- I don't care

862
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,950  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
what he says.

863
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,515  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:510
We're all bitten

864
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,911  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:510
and I refuse to spend my holiday
in a flea-hole!

865
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,275  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Where've you got to, goat?

866
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,157  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:510
Goatee!

867
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,478  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:516
Do as you like, then!

868
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,876  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:516
You still up?

869
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,030  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We've got fleas!

870
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,395  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You have?
Good night!

871
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,071  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:515
Mind out, children!

872
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,113  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
Keep your distance!

873
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,760  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
- First show him it's you,
so he's not scared!

874
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,034  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:515
- It's me, don't be scared!

875
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,551  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:510
Come here! Come on!
Come here Isha!

876
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,953  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:510
Don't be afraid!
Hold still!

877
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,071  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:510
You'll fell better too!

878
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,833  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:510
Don't be afraid!

879
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,038  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's it!

880
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,708  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Those are only dog fleas,
people don't catch them!

881
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,951  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Hold still, Isha!

882
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,151  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
- The kennel too!

883
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,630  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Come here, Isha!

884
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,030  X1:325 X2:394 Y1:484 Y2:510
Wait!

885
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,599  X1:297 X2:420 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Devil!
- Doggie!

886
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,318  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Show yourself!

887
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,196  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Is Mr. Komarek home?

888
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,191  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:484 Y2:515
- He is, come in!

889
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,990  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:510
Doesn't your dog have fleas?
- Yes.

890
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,753  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
But only dog fleas,
people don't catch those.

891
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,717  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've had just about enough.

892
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,509  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
How can I make any plans?

893
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,552  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:510
You'll have to talk to him.
He must tell us will he sell or not!

894
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:10,111  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He promised to sell the cow
and not sow again in spring.

895
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,475  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Has he written to Slovakia?
He hasn't.

896
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,152  X1:128 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
Has he found a buyer for the cow?
Nope.

897
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,708  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's done nothing!

898
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,518  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We should remind him...

899
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,114  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I can just see you...

900
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,192  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
You must speak forcefully!
Will you sell out? When?

901
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,953  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
You won't sell out?
Alright, we'll find something else.

902
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,758  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come on!

903
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,751  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good afternoon, Mr. Komarek.
- Good afternoon!

904
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,400  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:510
- God bless!
- Have some coffee with us?

905
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,755  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Well, if you insist.

906
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,440  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

907
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,992  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:516
I might break it!
Here you are.

908
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,840  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm used to my own mug.

909
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,559  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Right...

910
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,239  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Autumn's drawing near...

911
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,749  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Doesn't time fly.

912
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,637  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What are your plans afterwards?
- Afterwards?

913
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,757  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:516
Winter'll be coming, the snow...

914
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,508  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What about Slovakia?

915
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,034  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They have hard winters too.

916
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,473  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:510
Oh dear!

917
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,357  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
My son wrote...
- So he's written?

918
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,671  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They have snow-drifts 2 m. High!

919
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,830  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Of course, in Slovakia...
We went to Slovakia and...

920
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,872  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We want to talk about the cottage.

921
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,758  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Yes, you should buy it.

922
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,115  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes! It's all the same to you.
- Exactly!

923
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,873  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's what we wanted to talk about.

924
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,238  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'd keep my little room
and the rest'd be yours.

925
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:29,316  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'd keep an eye on the place for you,
you'd have milk...

926
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,155  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:510
- You mean - live on here with us?

927
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,993  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes. When I die,
it'll be all yours.

928
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,795  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We'll have to think about that.

929
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,474  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
We hadn't thought about that.

930
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,870  X1:160 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't we get along famously?

931
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,516  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
But it is great here, what?

932
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,196  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:515
- So look, Olda.

933
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,875  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:510
I finish here the day our holiday does!
- No rush!

934
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,518  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
- It's as clear as daylight.
- Everything will turn out alright!

935
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,990  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:448 Y2:516
- As clear as day! Nothing will change!
Fleas, chicken droppings!

936
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,356  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'll put a harness on him!
You'll groom him,

937
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,908  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:448 Y2:516
we'll be crammed into one damp room -
and the only difference will be that

938
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,150  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
except that we'd pay 20,000!
We'd be crazy!

939
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,912  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:448 Y2:515
Home, children!
- Look here, Vera...

940
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,310  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Make your choice.
Either me or the old man.

941
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,590  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good morning!
- Good morning!

942
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,352  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Hello, what's up?

943
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,319  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:515
- The kids are flea-bitten
and Vera's worried,

944
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,676  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
They were dog-fleas,
is there no danger of rabies?

945
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,671  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:516
Sorry to bother you, pal.

946
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,352  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Let me see!

947
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,431  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:510
We've never had this here before.

948
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,838  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
Where did you catch them?
- At the cottage.

949
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,509  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'll prescribe you some powder.

950
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,075  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Can I scratch?
- Yes.

951
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,149  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
Listen Olda...
Do mushrooms grow there?

952
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,554  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Tons, pal!

953
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,510  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:448 Y2:510
A lovely place.
- I know.

954
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,878  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:510
But while Komarek's around
Vera'll never be satisfied!

955
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,831  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He won't sell?
- He wants us to buy it

956
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,309  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:515
with him included,

957
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,789  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:510
and we'd have to wait till he dies.

958
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,356  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:516
How old is he?
- Over seventy.

959
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,556  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What did his father die of?

960
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,512  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
Heart and lungs are sound,

961
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,550  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:516
no vertigo

962
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,394  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
takes life with humour

963
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,635  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:516
digestion excellent!

964
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,960  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll outlive us yet, chum!

965
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,553  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:510
This drives Vera berserk.

966
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,470  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
We just live with the animals
and can't keep the place clean.

967
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,352  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Wait!

968
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,517  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
Has he got a visitor?

969
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,990  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:515
- No, he talks to the radio.

970
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,917  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:516
...I'll fulfil three wishes for you.

971
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,752  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Mind it's not a trap, boy!

972
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,597  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
He has nobody else to talk to.

973
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,392  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
We're going for a walk!

974
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,353  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He had three wishes and wasted
two already.

975
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,716  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:516
The ants will help him,

976
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,315  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
he helped them out too.

977
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,397  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:516
Good day!

978
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,991  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:515
A bastard, that Kokes.

979
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,071  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's stuffed up their chimney.

980
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,879  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
They'll freeze in winter.

981
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,755  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What have they done to him?
- Nothing. They don't want to die.

982
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,676  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
Water's the best way.

983
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,115  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:516
They jump out

984
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,952  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
from between your fingers.

985
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:16,558  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:516
This way it's sure.

986
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,556  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Would you care that the place had
no electricity?

987
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,639  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Definitely not.
You've got electricity in Prague.

988
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,910  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:516
D'you know what I'd do with that roof?

989
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,036  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Tile it.
- Yes.

990
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,111  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
With old corrugated tiles.

991
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,397  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:484 Y2:516
And I'd let grass grow in the yard.

992
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,115  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Grass, right.

993
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,596  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:510
- You'd leave that threshold?
- Yes.

994
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,750  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'd leave those stones.

995
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,999  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Vaclav,

996
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,191  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:484 Y2:516
why aren't you my wife?

997
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,476  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
Coming to Oumerice, boys?

998
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,558  X1:285 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:516
- No. Why?

999
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,512  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Local feast-day there today.

1000
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,749  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

1001
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,276  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:516
High time, too!

1002
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,229  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
They are our guests!

1003
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,192  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
- These are my Praguers!

1004
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,159  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Grandad! Look who's come!

1005
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,552  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:448 Y2:510
Johnny!
Sit down!

1006
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,474  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:516
Help yourself!
- Thanks. Enough!

1007
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,752  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
Thanks a lot.

1008
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,076  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
Roast duck!
Haven't had that for a long time.

1009
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,710  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:516
Bon appetit!
- Bon appetit!

1010
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,358  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Bon appetit!
- Bon appetit!

1011
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,351  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
Help yourself, Johnny!
- Yes, yes!

1012
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,357  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:510
- You must starve yourself all year!
- Oh no!

1013
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,237  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:510
The young lady cooked for me -
Mrs. Lavicka.

1014
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,270  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:516
They...

1015
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,557  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You don't know these gentlemen.
They're from Prague.

1016
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,159  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
Stop it, grandad...!

1017
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,152  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:510
Just ignore him!
It's sclerosis.

1018
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,912  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
Do help yourselves!

1019
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,999  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:448 Y2:516
They...
They...

1020
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,116  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:515
- Come, Grandad, to bed!

1021
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,951  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:510
You must remind him of somebody.
Take no notice!

1022
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,593  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:515
You don't know them, Grandad!

1023
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,272  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They...

1024
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,633  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Guess how old he is.
Ninety-two!

1025
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,676  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:516
- That's a good age!

1026
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,354  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:510
- He must take a rest.

1027
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,234  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:510
- They...
- You don't know them!

1028
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,550  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
- They look a sight!

1029
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,954  X1:284 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:510
Who is he?

1030
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,077  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:510
- The old man?

1031
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,517  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:510
- My father.
- Your father?

1032
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,076  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes!
- Your step-father?

1033
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,119  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:516
- No, my own!

1034
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,395  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:510
Well, goodbye, Mr. Komarek!
Take care!

1035
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,160  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:448 Y2:516
Be seeing you!
- Goodbye!

1036
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,150  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come here, goat!

1037
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,951  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
Home already?
- Yes, holiday's over.

1038
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,349  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!

1039
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,550  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:515
Good afternoon!
I have another week,

1040
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,279  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
and hope to finish here.

1041
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,512  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:448 Y2:516
We still have to set in the windows,
finish the chimney...

1042
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,797  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't rock me!
...finish off the electricity,

1043
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,077  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
build the fireplace,
I want to do the bathroom ceiling,

1044
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,593  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:510
but I don't have a Rabitz wall.

1045
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,159  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:510
- What's that?

1046
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,631  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wire netting.
You nail that to the ceiling...

1047
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,837  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:516
First you daub a bit of cement...

1048
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,553  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help! Catch me!

1049
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,274  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:516
Looks like a job for me!

1050
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,712  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:510
I can't find him!

1051
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,917  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Didn't he ride through?
- Must be inside!

1052
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,878  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mr. Lawrence!
- Mr. Lawrence!

1053
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,871  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mr. Lawrence!
He must be inside!

1054
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,439  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Mr. Lawrence!

1055
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,356  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I'm not working for you again!

1056
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,710  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:510
It's the end!

1057
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,476  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:510
- But all that's left now
are the windows

1058
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,790  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
and the chimney!
- I've finished with you.

1059
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,030  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Anything wrong?

1060
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,752  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The beer's gone.

1061
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,913  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You've only got the walls to do,

1062
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,072  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:515
and the ceilings...
- No, take me home!

1063
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,516  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:516
- We'll be going.
- Goodbye!

1064
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,353  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:515
- But... Mr. Lawrence,

1065
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,714  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'll never rock you again!
- No! No!

1066
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,592  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've finished with you!

1067
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,993  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
You'd cripple a man!

1068
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:01,358  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:510
We have a cottage by the wood,
but it's not ours.

1069
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,830  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:510
Grandfather Komarek lives there.

1070
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,073  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:447 Y2:516
He's very...
He isn't our grandfather either.

1071
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,392  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's very kind, but he's in the way.

1072
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,556  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Wait, Susie! How can you write

1073
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,392  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:516
that he's kind and in the way?

1074
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,516  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:515
- How do I write it, then?

1075
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,632  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes.

1076
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,877  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:515
That he's kind, that's true.

1077
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,155  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:510
- He is in our way,
that's true too.

1078
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,231  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:510
- But how can she

1079
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,757  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
put it like that,
he's kind and in the way.

1080
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,752  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
- How do I put it, then?

1081
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:38,719  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
- That he is kind,
that he means to move away

1082
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,756  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:516
and then the cottage will be ours.

1083
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,238  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Right, that he's kind
because he means to move away.

1084
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,757  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No!
He's kind, full stop!

1085
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,550  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:516
When he moves away,
the cottage will be ours.

1086
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,752  X1:117 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:516
Decided to spend the winter in bed?

1087
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,758  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:510
Where does it hurt?

1088
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,750  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Everywhere.
Don't even enjoy my smoke.

1089
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,754  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
We'll have to get you down!

1090
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,956  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Down? Where?
- To the car and to hospital.

1091
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:47,156  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Hospital?
I'm not going!

1092
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,352  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
- It's pneumonia, Mr. Komarek.
That's serious.

1093
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,512  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I've never been to hospital.

1094
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,230  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:515
If I'm to die, I'll die at home.

1095
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,392  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You won't die,
but you can't lie here!

1096
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,190  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
And you can't lie here ill.
- Don't worry, Mr. Komarek,

1097
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,838  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
you'll be back in a few days.

1098
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,593  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Stop fussing...

1099
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,470  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll dose myself with linden tea.

1100
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,951  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
I sweat and I'm well again.

1101
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,030  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Look here, Johnny,

1102
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,758  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
they won't bite your head off!

1103
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,558  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes.

1104
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,830  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I'll take care of your place.
- Yes.

1105
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,956  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:510
...do the feeding...
- Of course.

1106
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,519  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:510
...and everything.
- Of course.

1107
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,273  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Don't you worry!

1108
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,751  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I wouldn't beat you today, Tony!
- Hm.

1109
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,749  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:516
- There'll be pretty nurses there!

1110
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,196  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What good's that to me?
To an old man!

1111
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,912  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
Have you arranged things?
- Arranged what?

1112
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,709  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:515
- The sale,

1113
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,751  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:484 Y2:510
all that!

1114
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,671  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
- With you staying on here,
we would hardly...

1115
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,718  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Who says I'm staying?

1116
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:21,108  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
What would I do here?
- But we didn't know that.

1117
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,954  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Hruska's buying the cow,
I shan't sow again,

1118
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,158  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'll die and that's that!

1119
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,432  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Don't think of that.

1120
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,033  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes.
- You must get well now!

1121
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,678  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Yes.

1122
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,719  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good morning!
Are the Kokess here?

1123
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,030  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:516
- We're just expecting them.

1124
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,673  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Good morning!
I'm looking for the Chief!

1125
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,671  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Over there!

1126
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,233  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:516
Good morning!

1127
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,676  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:516
- I 'phoned, about Komarek's fields.

1128
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,990  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
- You're Komarek's Praguer.

1129
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,433  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Yes.
- How's the old man?

1130
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,078  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Still in hospital.

1131
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,878  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The Co-op's not too keep on

1132
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,748  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:448 Y2:516
getting those fields up on the slopes,
we'll make them into pastures.

1133
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,116  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:510
- So you'll confirm the Co-op taking
them over?

1134
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,031  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Yes, give it to me!

1135
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,111  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:510
- When can I fetch it?

1136
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,239  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'll do it on the spot.
Don't like red tape!

1137
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,909  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:515
Joe, over here!

1138
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,277  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
My regards to the old man!
- Thanks.

1139
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,635  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:515
Hell, this is the fifth time!

1140
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,075  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:510
Look at this! Look at this!
Maruna!

1141
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,748  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
How many times have I said
you must sweep the yard properly?

1142
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,070  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Go and get stuffed!
- This is the fifth time!

1143
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,148  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:510
Goodbye!
- Chick-chick-chick!

1144
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,393  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
Goodbye! Goodbye!

1145
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,949  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
A trash-bin with foot pedal.
You don't have that either.

1146
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,311  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hello, Mr. Kos!
- Hi there, neighbour!

1147
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,312  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Looks like you're all set
except for the letter-box.

1148
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,549  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:510
- How's life?

1149
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,679  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Oh, all those rubber stamps.
I've seen enough of them! You have...

1150
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,715  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I know!
...record...

1151
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,473  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
- The land register, geodetics...

1152
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,551  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
- The Co-op.
- National Committee.

1153
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,956  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Regional National Committee...
- Agricultural Agency.

1154
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,156  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:516
And the Notary.

1155
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,190  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:510
But now things look so bad
with Komarek...

1156
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,597  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He's still in hospital,
but he comes of good stock!

1157
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,470  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Wait... You don't seem to know!
- Something's happened?

1158
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,279  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Very bad!

1159
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,874  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:516
He was getting no better at hospital.

1160
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,033  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:448 Y2:516
So the poor old boy asked to spend
his last days at home.

1161
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,838  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:510
At least that's what Hruska told me.

1162
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,798  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hruska's looking after him.
The grate!

1163
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,950  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:516
I knew I'd forgotten something!

1164
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,197  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
D' you have a grate?

1165
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,238  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Hello!
Hello!

1166
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,150  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Hello!
- Hello!

1167
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,832  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Hello!
Been waiting long?

1168
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,150  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
- A couple of minutes.
- The notary, Mr. Grulich.

1169
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,196  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:510
- The Lavickas.
- Hello!

1170
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,396  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Hello! Hello! Hi!

1171
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,196  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Hello!
- Hello!

1172
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,999  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:510
- You see, Mr. Komarek...
- That's the owner?

1173
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,593  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:515
...the letter...
- Yes, that's the owner.

1174
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,955  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:510
...didn't answer our letter
so now we don't know.

1175
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,429  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:510
- We'll soon see.

1176
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,231  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:515
If Komarek has died,

1177
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,118  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
it would be complicated, what?

1178
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,760  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Such a sale takes years sometimes.

1179
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,397  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:516
Somebody inherits,

1180
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:27,268  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:510
I had a case the other day
with nine heirs to a house.

1181
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,237  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
- That could happen here too.

1182
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,029  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Eight of them agreed to sell.
One refused, and that was that!

1183
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,998  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:510
So now it'll drag on for years.
The owner should have left a will.

1184
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,230  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Daddy, he's crying!

1185
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,038  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is it, Pete?
What don't you understand now?

1186
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,435  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:510
- Gran... dad... died.

1187
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,471  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:510
Go on...!

1188
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,438  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
They're just talking...

1189
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,910  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
...just pretend, see?

1190
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,673  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He may not have died,
maybe he just can't hold a pen any more.

1191
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,955  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:516
- How many heirs are there?

1192
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:03,510  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:515
- A son in Slovakia, a father...

1193
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:06,950  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Was there a Will?
- Hardly.

1194
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,319  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:510
- But they had a preliminary...
...sales contract.

1195
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,879  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
- So they should have the right...

1196
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,793  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
- But such a contract alone
means nothing.

1197
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,155  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
Probably not even witnessed.

1198
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,992  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:516
- Probably not.

1199
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:22,550  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No good, then.
- What do you mean, no good?

1200
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,552  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
But he has the right to decide
who is to inherit his property!

1201
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,235  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:516
- But as a dead man can't make
any decisions...!

1202
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:32,278  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I'm not saying he can!
- The Will is decisive!

1203
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,997  X1:321 X2:398 Y1:484 Y2:510
