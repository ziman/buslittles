1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,160
I finished. You can stitch.

2
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,360
You are brilliant, professor.

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,360
Let's not exaggerate, dear colleague.

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,360
I don't know anybody else
who can do such a surgery.

5
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,320
For your information, I know a surgeon.

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,960
who, soon enough, will
manage just as well as me.

7
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,880
...in such a surgery.

8
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,960
- Who?
- You, dear collegue.

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
- Professor, you had three calls.
- All right, I was just leaving, thank you.

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,165
To make sure of the success of.

11
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,240
...our surgery we have
to wait till tomorrow.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,840
If something shows up, call
me immediately. To be honest...

13
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,600
...nothing will show up.

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,520
Forgive, dear collegue,
but I must go You know...

15
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,920
We are celebrating
eight years of marriage.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,000
- Congratulations professor!
- Thank you!

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
No, no, thank you, I can handle it.

18
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,840
- Good afternoon.
- Sir...

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
- Mr. Professor...
- Silence!

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Beata!

21
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,360
Where's the madam?

22
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,600
What happened?

23
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Beata!

24
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,660
Where is she?

25
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:46,560
She left a note.

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
What?

27
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,840
The madam left. Together with the girl.

28
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,240
I called her a taxi and brought
her things down. Two suitcases.

29
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,800
<i>Dear Rafal! I don't know if
you could ever forgive me...</i>

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,000
<i>I fell in love. And this
love is stronger than me.</i>

31
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,205
<i>I wasn't worthy for you.</i>

32
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>Your celebrity made
me feel even smaller.</i>

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,080
<i>I'm taking Marysia with me. I
can't imagine my life without her.</i>

34
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,800
<i>Do not look for me. It's useless. Beata.</i>

35
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,480
THE QUACK

36
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,640
<i>First part Antoni Kosiba.</i>

37
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,180
Please... Please, you good citizen...

38
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:37,005
...make a 5 bucks donation, for helping.

39
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
...the government's monopoly of
alcoholic beverages. Only 5 bucks.

40
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:41,725
What?

41
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,200
I see, you think I'm
some kind of beggar.

42
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,200
Wrong! I'm a good
citizen of this country.

43
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,440
Excuse me, but what do you need?

44
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,525
Anything.

45
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,600
Happiness, health, wellbeing...
and many more... it will be good...

46
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,365
Hey, my good old friend! Thank you!

47
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,360
One minute! One minute please!
Let me repay your kindness.

48
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,480
Yeah, yeah... I don't have
much! But I offer you my company.

49
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,445
<i>Noblesse oblige! I'll pay!</i>

50
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,160
<i>Me, Samuel Obiedzinski. Voila!</i>

51
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes, your highness. Napoleon and
Alexander The Great were fine men.

52
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,685
So what?

53
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey, another one please.

54
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,480
It's empty.

55
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,645
I must tell you.

56
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,160
It's not good to be famous. From up
high, it's much more painful to fall.

57
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:04,040
Smaller you are, the better.

58
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,320
Like me, Samuel Obiedzinski.

59
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:16,437
I'll never fall down...

60
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:19,520
...because I'm not famous.

61
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,440
I don't want to be
famous. I'm not a fool.

62
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,040
What's with you, are you bankrupt?

63
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Or they sent you far
away from home with work?

64
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:38,645
No, nothing of the sort.

65
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,040
Maybe a woman then? Changed her mind?

66
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,800
She just quit.

67
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's drink.

68
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,800
Women are worst than plague.

69
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,240
The woman who stays with you is like
a vampire. She sucks all your blood.

70
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
Other women squeeze your money out.

71
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:13,365
...and other women cheat you.

72
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,120
A woman seems to be a little goose.

73
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,217
...and she kicks your bottom...

74
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:23,026
...and you'll never get over it.

75
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:26,210
I know, I suffered a lot.

76
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:29,360
Strong as an oak tree...

77
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,360
...not even you, brother,
you will not bend...

78
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,400
...and you can't be torn out by the roots.

79
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Drink, it'll be easier.

80
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,480
Yes. You're right.
Torn out by the roots...

81
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,845
Everything's all right, just drink.

82
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,800
Human tragedies are often
bounded by nonsense. Yes. Sure.

83
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
A tragedy and...

84
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Hey, buddy. Who's paying?

85
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,440
Hey, don't sit here, go on.

86
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,840
Where should I take you, sir?

87
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,920
Please, please...

88
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,560
Do you know where he's living?

89
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,960
Has he got any papers?

90
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,720
Sobchek, search him.

91
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,045
I'm asking you again, who are you?

92
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,800
First name? Surname? Hey,
you there, are you deaf?

93
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:03,845
No, sergeant.

94
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760
And, please, don't get upset.

95
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,640
I didn't do anything wrong.

96
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,480
Don't bend the truth.

97
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,320
What shall I tell you?
I don't know my name.

98
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,560
Maybe I don't have a name.

99
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,080
I know, it sounds
strange but I'm not lying.

100
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Interesting.

101
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,320
So, you never had any papers at all?

102
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,885
Never.

103
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
How can you find work then?

104
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
In the cities, of course,
they asked me for papers.

105
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:48,280
...and I couldn't get a job anywhere...

106
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,960
...but in villages, no one
cared about the papers.

107
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,920
Here, everybody can call
themselves as they like.

108
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,880
They call me Jozef Barba.

109
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,245
Don't be afraid, sergeant.

110
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,840
I'm not a criminal, nor a thief.

111
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Have you ever been convicted?

112
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:08,777
Yes, twice.

113
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,880
Where, when?

114
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,160
First in Sokle.

115
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,165
where I stayed a month.

116
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Recently, I was jailed for two weeks.

117
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,160
What for?

118
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,680
For vagrancy, but unjustly.

119
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
If a man searches for
work, is he a vagrant?

120
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,360
Just because he doesn't have any papers?

121
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,965
Let me go, sergeant.

122
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm a peaceful man, I'm
not gonna hurt anybody.

123
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,080
Let you go, you say?

124
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,805
Unfortunately, it's impossible.

125
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,205
Now, we must send you back to the county.

126
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,680
...and let them solve the
problem with the papers.

127
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,000
It's true.

128
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,080
...that if you have papers, you're
somebody and if you don't you're nobody.

129
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,040
I tried to get identification papers.

130
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,965
I went to the law court, to the police...

131
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,800
I asked them to give me
any identification papers.

132
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:18,640
But no. They said that
there is no such law.

133
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,525
Try to find who you really are.

134
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,680
Everybody is registered somewhere.
Am I right, Mr. Kundejko?

135
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:26,920
Yeah, yeah. It's true.

136
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
When a person is born, I make a paper.

137
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,960
When a person dies,
I make another paper.

138
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,800
Here are the registers
for the whole county.

139
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,000
Take that away! This
desk has other purposes.

140
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,645
Sorry.

141
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,960
Get him out of here!

142
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,880
Antoni Frantiszek Kosiba.

143
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,520
Kosiba. Antoni Kosiba.

144
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,000
We gathered here today to honour the
memory of the brilliant man of science...

145
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,280
...of Poland...

146
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,560
...professor Rafal Wilczur.

147
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,120
In all these years we didn't lost our
faith that he'll come back some time.

148
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,000
But unfortunately, the
secret of his disappearance...

149
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:49,480
...until this day, is not known.

150
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:52,205
Me, by all means...

151
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,725
I tried to do the best...

152
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,240
...not to dishonour the
reputation of his clinic.

153
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,760
And today, naming this
clinic after his name.

154
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:07,365
...and erecting a monument in this respect.

155
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,240
we bring a tribute to
one of the best persons...

156
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,965
...to an excellent professor.

157
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,640
...and to a brilliant man of science.

158
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,600
Hello.

159
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:17,845
Hello.

160
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,965
May I have some water?

161
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,125
Thank God, we have plenty of water.

162
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,760
Behind the door there is a
tub. You can drink from there.

163
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,440
May I have a seat?

164
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,480
I don't mind at all. Take a seat.

165
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,120
Where are you coming from?

166
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,960
From far away.

167
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm looking for work.

168
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,480
I worked at a blacksmith,
here, in Mizcunah.

169
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,000
But he soon left.

170
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,600
In Mizcunah?

171
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:21,405
Yes.

172
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,960
I know the blacksmith there.

173
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,200
- The one with the squinting eye?
- Yeah, that's him.

174
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,880
- Are you good at smith's work?
- Yes, smith's work and.

175
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:31,840
...at many other things.

176
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,965
How come?

177
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,840
Yes. Just so... For 15 years
I'm trying to earn my living...

178
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:41,280
...and I learned to do many things.

179
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,800
They told me that in Mizcunah the
army recruited some of your workers.

180
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,680
True.

181
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,760
The harvest time is near. They're
looking for work at the mills.

182
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,720
So I thought you are
looking for workers.

183
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,280
Not even Sunday we
can't have a bit of rest!

184
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,280
How can I welcome a stranger
to my home with all that racket?

185
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,760
If you don't want it,
I'm not forcing you.

186
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:25,317
You do that.

187
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:26,805
Don't be upset.

188
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,280
I only met you once.

189
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,845
Leave me alone.

190
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Maybe you have the best intentions.

191
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,325
But you can be a bad man.

192
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
I don't know your name
and where you coming from.

193
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,757
My name is Antoni Kosiba.

194
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,045
...and I come from Kalisha.

195
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,280
Where is this Kalisha, end of the world?

196
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:48,160
Yeah, pretty far away.

197
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,120
You come here and give
me this piece of paper.

198
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,160
How do I know that you didn't steal it?

199
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,800
You're walking around, don't you have.

200
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:04,720
...a place of your own?

201
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,405
No, I don't.

202
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,240
Don't you have a wife?

203
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,365
No.

204
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
How come?

205
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,600
I don't know.

206
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,680
The woman is the origin of all wrongs.

207
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,845
Yeah, it's true.

208
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,120
Because of women we suffer shame,
we have troubles and headaches.

209
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,640
However, God's will is to marry them...

210
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,040
You don't have any relatives?

211
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
What about you?

212
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,680
I have my family.

213
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,280
And if suddenly, God forbid, they die...

214
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:50,240
...do you have any other people...

215
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:53,520
...here, to help you?

216
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,360
You win. You're clever.

217
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:07,885
You're right.

218
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,320
But I need young, strong men for work.

219
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:14,680
You can hardly carry yourself.

220
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,520
You seem to have travelled a lot.

221
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes, I travelled.

222
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,045
How is it then?

223
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,280
It's ordinary, like everywhere.

224
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:50,480
Have you been to the holy places?

225
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,440
Yes!

226
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,400
At Kalvarii...

227
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,120
Ostroi Brame, lasnoi Guje...

228
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,365
Oh, God.

229
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
And you could listen to the services?

230
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,920
Yes.

231
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,360
And the icons?

232
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,400
Did you really see the miracle
- working icons?

233
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
Yes, I did.

234
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,245
And did you see miracles as well?

235
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,640
No. But I've heard
many things about them.

236
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,880
What about the healings?

237
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,320
Yeah, I've heard about that.

238
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
And about that Catholic icon?

239
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,520
I don't know... Does it help
people of other religions?

240
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,880
For instance the Orthodox people.

241
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,885
I don't know.

242
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,280
But if the man is good...

243
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,240
...it must help him.

244
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,880
In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

245
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:05,120
C'mon.

246
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,680
I live here for 6 years.

247
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,205
I'm doing well.

248
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,380
The old man is tough, but correct.

249
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:14,520
To tell the truth, he had a brother.

250
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:16,245
who left him in misery.

251
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,045
And his children were very poor.

252
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,240
I don't know if it's true
or not. Think for yourself.

253
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
His older son drowned.

254
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,400
The second one disappeared
in the war and left a widow.

255
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:35,480
She's now living with them.

256
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,245
A woman so young.

257
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,520
And the youngest son,
Vasilia, you saw him.

258
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,685
His legs are broken.

259
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,120
The old man almost lost his mind.
He brought doctors from town...

260
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,840
...he spent plenty of money for nothing.

261
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,080
The doctors took his money,
but they couldn't fix his legs.

262
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,000
It seems that he's cursed or something.

263
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Why are you crying?

264
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Should I laugh?

265
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,560
I'm gonna kill myself.

266
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,000
I can't stand it anymore.

267
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,240
This is silly.

268
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,280
You're young, you have
so much time ahead of you.

269
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,280
I can't urinate. I'm
sitting here like a log.

270
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,720
I will be old sooner
or later, I understand.

271
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,640
My father stole my uncle's share...

272
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,640
...and I have to pay for his sins!

273
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Why did God crippled me?

274
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
How long have you been like that?

275
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,840
5 months.

276
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,840
Did they bring the
doctor in the first day?

277
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,400
Yes.

278
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,880
He promised that I would walk
again but he didn't cure me.

279
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:03,840
What did he do to you?

280
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,800
He put some splints on my legs...

281
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,760
...then he bandaged them...

282
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
...and in two months he
removed the bandage.

283
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,800
And then?

284
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,760
He looked and said.

285
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,760
...that not even God can help me.

286
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,720
Move your toes.

287
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,760
That's it. Now your foot.

288
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I can't. It hurts.

289
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,720
It hurts?

290
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,640
Yeah. You gonna walk soon, boy.

291
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,680
It's very good that
you can feel the pain.

292
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,120
Your bones aren't well fixed.

293
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,680
We must break them again, and fix them...

294
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,600
...and you'll be all right.

295
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,240
If you couldn't move your
toes, then it would be bad.

296
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,960
But it's all right.

297
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,640
How can you tell?

298
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,080
How?

299
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,600
I just know.

300
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,600
It's simple.

301
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,080
We just break them
again and fix them back.

302
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,040
And you can walk again.

303
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Doctor Pawlicki wouldn't agree.

304
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,040
We don't need him.

305
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll do everything.

306
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,040
You?

307
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,480
You'll dance like before.

308
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,960
What are you talking about?

309
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,125
This is a surgery.

310
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,680
The doctor himself couldn't do anything.

311
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:02,165
You'll do it, you ignorant?

312
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,240
Do you want him to be crippled
for the rest of his life?

313
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,440
The doctor wasn't asked for his approval.

314
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,200
...and you already determined
that he hasn't anything serious.

315
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,120
- Do you know what he decided?
- No, he didn't tell me.

316
00:37:12,155 --> 00:37:14,960
Listen. He wants to kill himself.

317
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:17,480
My God!

318
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,360
Leave God alone. He's
not gonna help you.

319
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,365
And your so called
misfortune, in your family...

320
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
...that you've been punished for
stealing from your brother...

321
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,360
- Where did you hear that?
- It doesn't matter. Listen.

322
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,400
- It's not true, I'm telling you!
- Everyone slanders.

323
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,360
And your son thinks the same.

324
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,320
My God, my poor boy.

325
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,040
That will do. And your
troubles will be over...

326
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,040
...and your boy will
carry the mill's duties.

327
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Are you able to do it?

328
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Yes.

329
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Listen, Antoni. If he's gonna die?

330
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,080
No. He won't die.

331
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,880
Can you swear?

332
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,720
I swear.

333
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,740
On the Virgin Mary?

334
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:10,040
On the Virgin Mary.

335
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,445
And on Jesus Christ?

336
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
Yes. On Jesus Christ too.

337
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,720
Then, swear.

338
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,640
I swear.

339
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

340
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
What do you want?

341
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,560
I'm listening.

342
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,840
Have you got some thread?

343
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,240
What kind?

344
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,805
Silk.

345
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,360
Yes. How thick?

346
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,480
The one for embroidery?

347
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:50,440
No, for stitching.

348
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,805
White?

349
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,520
Yes. And more resistant.

350
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,000
Here you are.

351
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,240
I know you're a brave boy.

352
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,400
Squeeze your teeth and don't talk.

353
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm gonna tie you up, not to move...

354
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,200
All right.

355
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,160
Otherwise my work will be in vain.

356
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,965
It will hurt a bit.

357
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,320
Antoni. Will I walk again?

358
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:45,757
Walk? Of course.

359
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:49,160
Same as before?

360
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,120
Even better.

361
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,520
Drink this.

362
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,640
Drink.

363
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Bite this. It'll help.

364
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Don't look.

365
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Vasili.

366
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,080
My son...

367
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,120
You're alive...

368
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,280
Zenek, what are you waiting?
The people are tired of waiting.

369
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,000
Thank you, I've read it.

370
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,960
So soon?

371
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,640
Are you gonna tell me stories today?

372
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,240
Do you want me to tell?

373
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,200
Of course!

374
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,160
No. Why only I have to
talk, and you not to?

375
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,320
I'll listen.

376
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,120
And I will listen, with pleasure.

377
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,800
I don't have anything to tell you. You
travelled a lot, you've seen so many things.

378
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,520
But I haven't met a
gorgeous girl like you...

379
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,280
You're mocking me.

380
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,520
I wouldn't dare.

381
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,480
Mr. Leszek...

382
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,040
We used to say: "Ask!
If no one gives, take!"

383
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
Here you go!

384
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,040
...and I'm at your feet.

385
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,800
Hello, Marusinka.

386
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:41,280
Hello.

387
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,445
How can I help you?

388
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,800
Same. Cigarettes and matches.

389
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,600
Here you go. 60.

390
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,600
Thank you. Good bye.

391
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,240
Do you realise what could he imagined?

392
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,920
I felt like a lover
hidden in the wardrobe.

393
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,840
A nobleman in a shopkeeper's wardrobe!

394
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,760
But I must confess that the
shopkeeper has beautiful legs.

395
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,840
Would you please, count, to pass
over with the same ability, back?

396
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,120
Don't you like me?

397
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,365
I'm waiting.

398
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,640
Don't you want me?

399
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,520
All right.

400
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,720
How about now?

401
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,400
C'mon, move your foot.

402
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,360
Carefully.

403
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,040
Does it hurt?

404
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,520
A bit.

405
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,920
Now try to flex your leg.

406
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,200
I'm scared.

407
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,200
C'mon! Courage!

408
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,800
It moves.

409
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,445
You see?

410
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,445
Easy, easy. Don't hurry.

411
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,160
Now, the other leg. That's it.

412
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,120
Higher.

413
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,000
You're gonna be all right. In a
week or so you will stand up, slowly.

414
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,480
- Antoni.
- What?

415
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,520
Will I walk in a week?

416
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,080
Not suddenly. You have to get
used with it, little by little.

417
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,685
It can't be, I don't believe it.

418
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,360
Upon my word. Unlikely, but it happened.

419
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,560
And then a reception was
made. Guests... Have come...

420
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,760
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

421
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,920
Do you still need silk thread?

422
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,640
No, this time, be a sweetheart and give
me some tobacco and cigarette paper.

423
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,080
Here yo go. 70.

424
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,040
Here you go.

425
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,760
Thank you.

426
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,440
Good bye, lady.

427
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:40,600
Good bye.

428
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,285
What is it, count?

429
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,600
No surprise if hunting
these animals was permitted.

430
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,440
I now understand why lord's
Karrigan gun gone off by mistake.

431
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,485
It's not funny.

432
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,845
Sorry. Where were we?

433
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,080
"And then a reception was made... "

434
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,360
Yeah. You're right.

435
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,445
So...

436
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,720
Noted guests were Radzivillii,
Kazakevicii and us, Czynskii.

437
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,320
Me, your count of Czynski, being
the only bachelor 'round there...

438
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,880
...all the bag of bones brought their
daughters there, searching for husbands.

439
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,280
And I didn't like them!

440
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,000
The orchestra played a mazurka!

441
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,800
And along the walls, lots of pretenders.

442
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,480
God, what country goslings!

443
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,760
Dresses, sewed out of grandmothers'
shawls, after the latest parisian fashion.

444
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:37,680
In the room, an air of
alcohol and moth balls.

445
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,600
But... Noblesse oblige.

446
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:41,445
Each of these sad girls.

447
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,560
who wanted to dance with count Czynski, will
remember this for the rest of their lives.

448
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:46,285
I approach. I bow.

449
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,680
Excuse me, but I'm busy.

450
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,040
What happened?

451
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,520
Nothing.

452
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,520
Did I offend you?

453
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,520
No, you're too well-off to
talk with me, count Czynski.

454
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,680
Marysia...

455
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,680
Can I help you?

456
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,000
Forgive me, please, but
I must clean the shop.

457
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,080
I'm afraid that if
you're going to stay here...

458
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,160
...your elegant London
made suit will get dusty.

459
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,440
Do you want anything else?

460
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,040
All the best!

461
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,080
Farewell, lady.

462
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,560
Leave the crutches!

463
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,720
I'm afraid.

464
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,640
Throw them away!

465
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Come here.

466
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,120
C'mon.

467
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,600
C'mon!

468
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,600
Hello, madam Marysia.

469
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Hello.

470
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:53,120
Tomorrow's Sunday and it seems
that we'll have a good weather.

471
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,720
Yeah, probably.

472
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,360
Could I, Miss Marysia...

473
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,880
...invite you to take a walk
through the park, with me?

474
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,640
No...

475
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,360
Although... You're welcome, Mr. Zenek.

476
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,240
Everything that my dad has...

477
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,600
will be mine some day.

478
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,360
I'm glad.

479
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,640
As you see, Miss Marysia...

480
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,680
...if my father will go to the landlady...

481
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,440
which is also your tutor...

482
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,440
...and he'll talk to her, and
he'll ask her to marry him...

483
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,320
I don't understand what
are you saying, Mr. Zenek.

484
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,180
Your father is married.

485
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:25,000
Yes, but I'm single.

486
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,240
No, it's impossible.

487
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,400
I don't care if you
don't have any dowry.

488
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,360
You're an intelligent, beautiful girl.

489
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,640
With a wife like you
I wouldn't be ashamed.

490
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,640
I have plenty of money.
And, thank God, I'm healthy.

491
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,600
I could make you happy.
You'll see, Miss Marysia.

492
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,320
It's impossible, Mr.
Zenek. I don't love you.

493
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,680
Real money...

494
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,640
You'll have enough money
till the day you die.

495
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,640
I'm very much obliged to you.

496
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,520
I wouldn't pay me
with any kind of money.

497
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:45,245
But everything I have, it's yours.

498
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,280
What's with you, Procop?
Have you gone crazy?

499
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,040
Take it.

500
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,880
I didn't do it for money.

501
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,200
I felt pity for the boy.

502
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,620
I said take it.

503
00:56:58,655 --> 00:57:00,400
No, I won't.

504
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,960
It's from the bottom of our heart...

505
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:04,120
Take it!

506
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,760
And I'm telling you from
the bottom of my heart.

507
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,320
...that a loaf of bread in my pocket.

508
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,640
...and some tobacco, will always be enough.

509
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,480
Listen, Antoni.

510
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,400
If I crawl on my knees
would you take it?

511
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,160
Everybody will blame me when they'll.

512
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,520
...find out that I didn't repay you.

513
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,760
Aren't you ashamed for that?

514
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,120
It's not Christianly. Take it.

515
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,280
No.

516
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,280
Don't you want gold?

517
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,600
Then, can I ask you...

518
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,120
...to stay with us...

519
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,840
...brother?

520
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,540
Here you go.

521
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:02,600
Thank you.

522
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,005
Heavy rain, isn't it?

523
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,845
I can wait, if you're not in a hurry.

524
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,480
It's a long way till
the mill. You'll get wet.

525
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,040
You knew I was from the mill?

526
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,040
Of course.

527
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,165
You are the quack.

528
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,000
Everybody talks about you.

529
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,280
Why do you look at me like that?

530
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,005
How?

531
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Oh, no... The song...

532
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,600
I've heard it before.

533
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,040
It was well known once.

534
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,440
My mother used to sing it to me.

535
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,000
So you're not the owner's daughter?

536
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,600
No, I just work here.

537
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,160
Where is your mother then?

538
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,640
My mother died...

539
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,240
when I was little.

540
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,720
Flu.

541
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,560
If she had lived in our times...

542
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,920
...you should have cured her.

543
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,920
Where's your father?

544
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,760
He died earlier.

545
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,560
I don't remember.

546
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,280
I always lived with my mother.

547
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,160
I have no relatives.

548
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,320
So...

549
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,120
It's not easy to be alone.

550
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,760
<i>Second part Maria Jolanta Wilczur.</i>

551
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,920
So are you the quack?

552
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,480
I just work at the mill.

553
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,520
But you try to cure people.

554
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,720
Do you know that it's a crime?

555
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,840
What do you want? Who are you?

556
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,840
I'm a doctor, unlike you.

557
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:28,120
Besides, I have a doctorate in medicine.

558
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,000
You're very much mistaken if you believe.

559
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,440
...that I'm gonna close
my eyes regarding that.

560
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,600
...you're poisoning people.

561
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,640
You powder a bit of this in
a quarter of a litre glass.

562
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,880
Drink it hot.

563
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,920
Half of glass on an empty stomach, the
other half before you go to bed. Got it?

564
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,400
Yeah, yeah.

565
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,600
Leave it.

566
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,640
God bless you.

567
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,480
So you're saying that
I'm poisoning them?

568
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,160
You're saying that you treat them?

569
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:03,325
None of them have died.

570
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,600
They didn't die. But in
this way, they'll surely die.

571
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,520
I forbid you to torture
them with such practices...

572
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,400
...in such a dump, in such a misery.

573
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Your hand has more germs
than a hospital has.

574
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,840
If you don't stop with this
so-called medical practice...

575
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,400
I will throw you in jail.

576
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,840
I didn't hurt anybody.

577
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,240
And in jail... People live there too.

578
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,240
All right. I've warn you.

579
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,640
Hello, doctor.

580
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,200
Remember me?

581
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,980
As you can see, I can walk.

582
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:58,480
And I don't limp at all.

583
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,280
Antoni cured me.

584
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,840
And you told me that I
would never walk again...

585
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,360
...that I will always be an invalid.

586
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,800
How did he cure you?

587
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,120
He saw that my bones were badly knitted.

588
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,120
He broke them again
and he put them together.

589
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:17,120
I can dance, too!

590
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,640
Excellent. Congratulations.

591
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,920
Let's go!

592
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,400
You're a good man, Antoni...

593
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,240
...but you don't realise
that you could be rich.

594
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,000
You could have.

595
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,320
...plenty of money.

596
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,600
There was a large crowd at your door.

597
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,720
Of course! God told us to
take care of sick people.

598
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,640
Why free?

599
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,320
I don't need money.

600
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,880
I'm not starving...

601
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,840
...and I don't have anyone to inherit it.

602
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,280
That's a shame.

603
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,680
What?

604
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,400
That you don't have anybody.

605
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,320
That you're not married,
that you don't have children.

606
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,200
I'm old enough.

607
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,240
Oh, you're old!

608
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,320
Any woman will marry to
you. I would marry you.

609
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,600
So you say.

610
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,120
I would marry you. Without
hesitation. It's true.

611
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,440
All right, let's stop the twaddle.

612
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,280
And why is this a twaddle?

613
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,960
You know, every month...

614
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,640
...someone is always proposing to me.

615
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,640
I'm still young, although I'm a widow.

616
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,920
But I didn't like anyone.

617
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,080
But I'd marry you.

618
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,200
Just give me a sign.

619
01:07:40,235 --> 01:07:41,200
I'm serious.

620
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,520
And my father-in-law
will be happy.

621
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,200
I have no energy.

622
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,280
What, you don't like me?

623
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,760
I like you, I don't like
you, it doesn't matter.

624
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:55,525
Why?

625
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,080
Just so...

626
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,320
You need a woman, am I right?

627
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,840
No.

628
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,640
You monster!

629
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,800
You...

630
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,800
Get stuffed...

631
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,080
I hate you, you lunatic!

632
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,040
Damn you!

633
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:11,000
Hello.

634
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,840
I came to ask for forgiveness.

635
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,600
What have you done wrong?

636
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,320
I was tactless last time.

637
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,200
Maybe. I didn't notice.

638
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,480
And I think it is regrettable.

639
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,720
...that the count's thoughts
were about my humble person.

640
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,600
One of our advantages is that.

641
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,440
we are polite...

642
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,640
...even when when we're hurt,
we are lured to be different.

643
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,840
I wasn't deceived by
your politeness, count.

644
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,560
How come? Since when?

645
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,840
Since the beginning.

646
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,400
Swell.

647
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,600
I can't understand
why are you so worried.

648
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,120
You're wrong. I'm not worried...

649
01:09:45,155 --> 01:09:48,177
...if you forgive me.

650
01:09:48,212 --> 01:09:51,200
That's what I thought.

651
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,840
That's very well.

652
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,200
I hate you.

653
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,040
I hate you for...

654
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,280
What for?

655
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,320
'Cause I don't have
the power to forget you.

656
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,600
Please, Mr. Leszek...

657
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:16,920
I don't wanna see you again.

658
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,920
Don't come anymore.

659
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,720
Good afternoon, Mrs. Marysia.

660
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,400
Good afternoon.

661
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,240
You surprise me...

662
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,000
with your cleverness.

663
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,520
...and with your talent.

664
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,880
Why's that?

665
01:10:56,915 --> 01:10:59,200
The sofa.

666
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,200
What sofa?

667
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,800
What sofa?

668
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,080
You, in the shop, near the counter...

669
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,120
...together with count
Czynski, rather intimate...

670
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,680
I don't understand.

671
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,720
No need to. Understanding is
not important. The skill is.

672
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,200
You're a bastard.

673
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,280
You're a sick bastard.

674
01:11:29,315 --> 01:11:32,605
Me?

675
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,320
Yeah, bastard.

676
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,720
Apologize to the girl.

677
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,280
What's wrong?

678
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,720
Don't make me wait for you.

679
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,720
I'm sorry.

680
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,840
Give him a hand.

681
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,400
Don't stand there.

682
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,920
Why are you laughing?

683
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,360
Cool off!

684
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,680
How embarassing!

685
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,800
How dared he? Why?

686
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,440
Calm down, Marysia. He'll not dare to.

687
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:34,800
There will be others.

688
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,120
Others? Let them try it once.

689
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:38,200
You can't stop them all.

690
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,600
It's ridiculous to pay
attention to everyone...

691
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,000
Ridiculous. You're
not living among them.

692
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,040
As a matter of fact, I told you,
there's no need to meet again.

693
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,480
Marysia...

694
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,000
I always felt that
something will happen.

695
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:48,277
But, Marysia...

696
01:12:48,312 --> 01:12:49,520
Please. Please...

697
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,520
...don't come back. Never!

698
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,480
I'm begging you.

699
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,520
I don't want to see you again!

700
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,400
Please, give us half an hour.

701
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,920
Me and your father want to
talk something important.

702
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,400
Half an hour?

703
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,160
Is it too much for your parents?

704
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,920
No, mother, I'll listen to you.

705
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,640
You see, there are rumours that
your frivolity passed all the bounds.

706
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,680
We never blamed you for anything.

707
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,680
But I have an obligation.

708
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,720
Our son mustn't lose his dignity.

709
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,680
What do you mean?

710
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,720
How could you beat that peasant?

711
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,800
I don't understand, dad.

712
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,320
To intercede for a girl...

713
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,600
who was offended in public,
means that I lost my dignity?

714
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:18,120
This girl, Marysia, she's a shopgirl.

715
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,240
Does it matter?

716
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,600
Of course.

717
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,880
Do you really know her?

718
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,920
As long as I'm buying
cigarettes from her...

719
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,640
Every day?

720
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,880
Maybe.

721
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,760
For this, it's not necessary
to be there for several hours.

722
01:14:34,795 --> 01:14:35,805
And when it is necessary?

723
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,000
You really don't undestand,
that your daily visits.

724
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,040
...at this shop, will draw attention.

725
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,080
Strange, innit? It's just
a shop, a public place...

726
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,920
where everybody can be there.

727
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,320
My dear. Your argument.

728
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:54,720
...it's ridiculous.

729
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,040
I hardly believe that
your interest for the shop.

730
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,320
...is caused by the study of
subtleties related to trade.

731
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,720
There's something going on
between you and this little girl.

732
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,440
Even so, then, what?

733
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,240
Do you want to tell me what a
pleasant conversation means to you?

734
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,080
All right, mom.

735
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,720
Do you think that this
girl is right for you?

736
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,600
With your position in the society?

737
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,320
With your intellectual and social level?

738
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,000
You don't know her.

739
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,040
Imagine that, I had no
intention to meet her.

740
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,200
I heard enough.

741
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,520
Because of your often visits,
this girl was offended...

742
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,840
...probably by one unlucky admirer.

743
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,600
And you had the insolence to
implicate in a disgusting fight...

744
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:52,560
...to protect the honour of
this girl, who's easy to get.

745
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,360
Why are you talking about
her with this offending tone?

746
01:15:57,395 --> 01:16:01,720
For a woman with your
education, is at least indecent.

747
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,640
I'm ashamed of you.

748
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:05,640
Leszek!

749
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,080
Excuse me.

750
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,840
Are you rude with your mother
because of a shopkeeper?

751
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,600
You're right.

752
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,000
I did all this fuss and I'm guilty.

753
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,840
As a decent person, I cannot
admit talking trash about her.

754
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,280
My dear, you assumed a
ungrateful obligation.

755
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,480
It's not your duty to
save her reputation.

756
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,520
We decided that, for a period
of time, it's best to leave.

757
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,520
To calm down your passion.

758
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,280
Dad!

759
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:44,240
You gonna go with uncle Eustachie,
in Warsaw. You gonna enjoy yourself.

760
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:47,480
Be kind.

761
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,800
Here you go.

762
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,840
Did they start to make
your life miserable?

763
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,840
Did you find out?

764
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,480
Yes, I've heard.

765
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,520
Everybody looks at me.

766
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,880
They call me a mistress.

767
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,860
They are talking bad things about me.

768
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:19,240
I know, they won't leave me alone...

769
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,720
...until they'll ruin everything.

770
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,720
Why are people so bad?

771
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,640
Ignore these rumours.

772
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,440
Ignore what people are saying.

773
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,000
And forget him.

774
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:40,040
He's rich, well known and a noble.

775
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,400
You can't marry him.

776
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,120
He'll never marry you.

777
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,120
I never thought about this.

778
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,400
But he's a decent person.

779
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,840
He'll not permit such
suppositions to be made on you.

780
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,840
...and no one will say
anything against you.

781
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,120
The count will never come here.

782
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,520
I told him...

783
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,320
I forbid him to come.

784
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,640
Does the lady accepts to be my wife?

785
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,200
What are you talking about?

786
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,480
What are you saying?

787
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,520
Do you want to marry me, Marysia?

788
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,720
No, I can't believe it.

789
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:28,040
Oh God, are you serious?

790
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,605
And your parents?

791
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,120
If you say "yes", I'm gonna
tell them everything today.

792
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,200
They wouldn't agree.

793
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,605
Don't worry. They
will have to accept it.

794
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,040
However, I'm an engineer.
We can manage without them.

795
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,200
And you... My darling...

796
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,520
Maybe you don't love me?

797
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,520
Me? Not loving you?

798
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,400
Let's go, Marysia.

799
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,200
And the shop?

800
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:18,240
From now on, you'll
not work here anymore.

801
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,720
Zenek, don't do any foolishness.

802
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,000
Leave me alone.

803
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,200
Don't start again.

804
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:36,240
Go to hell!

805
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,440
Oh God, it's so nice.

806
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,240
Does it mean that we are engaged?

807
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,960
Yes, my darling. You're now my bride.

808
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,840
Your bride... I'm feeling giddy already.

809
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,640
I don't have any ring to give it to you.

810
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:43,760
Marysia. I'm yours without
the ring. Forever. I love you.

811
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,000
I love you too.

812
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,440
What have I done...

813
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,200
Oh, God...

814
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,600
I've killed them. It's terrible.

815
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,640
Fo... Folks... Hey folks, here!

816
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,560
Help!

817
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,440
Help!

818
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,000
What happened?

819
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,900
Help them, help me.

820
01:26:16,935 --> 01:26:19,240
Help. They're alive.

821
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,725
They fell off the motor bike...

822
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,320
...but they're still alive! They're alive!

823
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:45,640
Light!

824
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,480
Oh, God...

825
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,080
I can't cure them by myself.

826
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:24,120
Call the doctor.

827
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,200
Vitalis. Harness the horses!

828
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,800
Wait. I'll go. You go to the mansion.

829
01:27:30,835 --> 01:27:32,400
Call Czynski.

830
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,040
Wait! Wait!

831
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,365
How is my son? Is he alive?

832
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,245
Calm down, madam.
He's out of any danger.

833
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,080
I don't trust this man!
Answer me, doctor, I beg you!

834
01:28:03,115 --> 01:28:04,245
It's not serious.

835
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,245
Some scratches on the
face, and a broken arm.

836
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,440
I immobilized her with
splints, so everything is fine.

837
01:28:09,475 --> 01:28:11,245
There's no need for other examinations.

838
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,720
You do not give instructions. As
far as I know, I should do this.

839
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:17,417
There's no need for you here.

840
01:28:17,452 --> 01:28:20,045
This girl here needs help.

841
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,700
Is he in a coma, or he's just sleeping?

842
01:28:22,735 --> 01:28:25,285
He's sleeping. He has an open fracture.

843
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,480
I gave him some sleeping
pills, to ease his pain.

844
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:30,600
Doctor, please come here.

845
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,800
What have you done, are you mad?

846
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,480
How dared you to treat him?

847
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,040
His bone was coming
out. What could I do?

848
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,800
I, myself, I would have waited!

849
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,680
I sent for you but you weren't home.

850
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,520
Should I let a injured man to suffer?

851
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,520
He's right, Mr. Pawlicki.

852
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,920
Here you go. Accept it, please.

853
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,600
No, take them away.

854
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,040
It is said that you treat
poor people for free...

855
01:28:58,075 --> 01:29:00,720
...but, I can assure you, that we can pay.

856
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,920
For me, they are not poor, nor rich.

857
01:29:02,955 --> 01:29:05,045
I'm ready for anyone who needs help.

858
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,160
But for your son, if i wouldn't
have felt the impulse of duty...

859
01:29:07,195 --> 01:29:08,845
I wouldn't touch him.

860
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,960
Because of him, this girl is dying now.

861
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,565
I suspect a brain contusion.

862
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,120
It's necessary a cerebral tomography.

863
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,960
We must take the count to the
hospital, as soon as possible.

864
01:29:25,995 --> 01:29:28,000
Yes, of course, doctor.

865
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,400
What's with her?

866
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,440
The bone penetrated her brain.

867
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,040
She's already agonizing. Medical
practices are useless in this case.

868
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,605
She can be saved, doctor.

869
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,400
The only thing that
I could do for her is.

870
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,480
...to give her an injection.
For cardiac stimulation.

871
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:44,480
It's hopeless.

872
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,400
Please, turn up her sleeve.

873
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,525
Doctor...

874
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,400
Yeah, she's gonna die.

875
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,400
You don't have the right
to leave her like that.

876
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,560
Undergo a surgery.

877
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,160
What are you saying?

878
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,880
No surgeon can bring her to life...

879
01:31:32,915 --> 01:31:34,560
...not even the most ingenious one.

880
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,680
If only I'd have my instruments...

881
01:31:37,715 --> 01:31:39,400
Fortunately, you don't.

882
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,200
Doctor! I want to
take my son to the car.

883
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:45,400
All right. I'll call somebody.

884
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,280
Hey, miller, help us here.

885
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:01,280
You too, please.

886
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,160
Careful not to stumble.

887
01:32:25,195 --> 01:32:27,880
Be careful.

888
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Let's take him to the hospital. Quick.

889
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,240
Doctor, are you convinced.

890
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,165
...that our son's life is not in danger?

891
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,840
It is hard to tell before an
examination and a radiography.

892
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,440
He must be carefully treated.

893
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,760
We'll send him to Switzerland,
at the best sanatorium.

894
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,205
Where am I, what happened?

895
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Nothing, dear, calm down, don't
move, it's not good for you.

896
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,685
What about me?

897
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,880
You were on the motor
bike and fell down.

898
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,080
You have a broken arm,
but there's no danger.

899
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,000
Is Marysia still alive?

900
01:33:41,035 --> 01:33:43,525
She's... Dead.

901
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,080
Calm down! Doctor!

902
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,600
You shouldn't tell him that.

903
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,760
I'm not used to lie!

904
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,725
It was a blow for him.

905
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,680
Maybe he cared for the girl.

906
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,680
You must be joking.

907
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,600
My girl... Do you recognize me?

908
01:37:25,635 --> 01:37:29,240
Do you recognize me?

909
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:37,120
Where's Leszek? What happened
to him? Is he still alive?

910
01:37:37,155 --> 01:37:40,000
He's alive. He wasn't badly hurt.

911
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,960
Just a broken arm.

912
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
His parents sent him
abroad for treatment.

913
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:51,200
Only if he can recover.

914
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,560
I saved her!

915
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,800
Is it him?

916
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,640
No.

917
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:54,680
C'mon...

918
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

919
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,200
We want to talk to you, Mr. Kosiba.

920
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,600
And you, Mrs. Marysia, how do you feel?

921
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:13,560
Very well, sir.

922
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,320
I feel much better.

923
01:39:15,355 --> 01:39:17,040
Glad to hear that.

924
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,960
Hasn't she got fever?

925
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,200
No. She had a bit after the surgery.

926
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,360
Can she move her arms and legs?

927
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,760
Her nervous system wasn't affected?

928
01:39:24,795 --> 01:39:26,280
Doctor? I'm in good health...

929
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,240
...but still weakened.

930
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:33,280
Take it easy.

931
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,160
How can I help you?

932
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,805
Mr. Kosiba.

933
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:42,100
Is it true that Marysia
was in a critical state.

934
01:39:42,135 --> 01:39:45,360
...and that you performed
a surgery... A trepanning?

935
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,685
Yeah, that's right. So what?

936
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,485
You don't have a doctor's diploma.

937
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,960
You broke the law through your actions.

938
01:39:50,995 --> 01:39:53,885
Maybe. Because the doctor...

939
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,040
who normally has the duty to
treat the patients, to save them...

940
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,000
...instead of doing it, he ran away.

941
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:01,897
I protest! It's a lie.

942
01:40:01,932 --> 01:40:03,725
I analyzed her situation.

943
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,200
...and her condition was hopeless...

944
01:40:06,235 --> 01:40:08,640
...since she started to agonize.

945
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,280
Some medical instruments
disapperead from Mr. Pawlicki.

946
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,600
He declared that he suspects you.

947
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,400
Tell me, do you admit
that you took them?

948
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,400
Maybe he doesn't.

949
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,040
We better search him.

950
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,960
Don't tell me what to do, doctor.

951
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I know my job.

952
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,680
So, do you admit?

953
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,960
Yes.

954
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Are they here?

955
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,360
Yes.

956
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:46,400
Give them to me.

957
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Are these the ones?

958
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:56,960
Yes.

959
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,280
Chech to make sure
that no one is missing.

960
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,440
Yes, I think so.

961
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:05,080
That's no answer. It must be precise.

962
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:08,160
Yes, they are all.

963
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,400
I must arrest you, Mr. Kosiba.

964
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,160
What for? It's unfair.

965
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,200
He took them to save a woman's life.

966
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,200
The court will be the judge of that.

967
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,605
Don't cry...

968
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:29,200
Crying won't do any
good. I did steal them.

969
01:41:29,235 --> 01:41:32,565
To save my life.

970
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:36,880
That's right. But a theft is a theft.

971
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:53,280
How long these disgusting supertitions.

972
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:58,680
...of Middle Ages will exist?

973
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,680
How long should we tolerate.

974
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:09,600
...the criminal, ignorant
activities of the quacks?

975
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,080
The verdict, which will
be given in this affair...

976
01:42:13,115 --> 01:42:16,045
...maybe should solve,
finally, the problem:

977
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:20,920
...are we a civilised country
and are we belonging to Europe.

978
01:42:20,955 --> 01:42:25,000
...not only geographically,
but also culturally?

979
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,200
How long will we coexist.

980
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,000
with such barbarism?

981
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,760
Today's verdict.

982
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,640
...should be a warning.

983
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,680
...for all those who
enrich on people's back!

984
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,160
It can't be!

985
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,200
Three months maybe?

986
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,840
No, Marysia. Three years.

987
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,760
The prosecutor was very angry.

988
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,200
You ought to see how
many people helped him!

989
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,400
Although some praised
him, didn't matter.

990
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,560
The prosecutor carried on.

991
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,080
And when they asked
Antoni, after his release...

992
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:04,080
...if will he treat people again...

993
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,760
...then he said that he'll
never give up helping people...

994
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,800
...and if he'll arrive
on time to save a man...

995
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,440
...he will do it.

996
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,125
So, they gave him three years.

997
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,680
I'm the only one responsible for this.

998
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,965
What can we do?

999
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,325
Let's think, how can he be released?

1000
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,680
We cannot help him escape from prison...

1001
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,445
My advice is to make an appeal.

1002
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:28,600
And it absolutely necessary
to have an expensive lawyer.

1003
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,440
We'll pay him, we must
have something to pay him.

1004
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:31,845
Money is not a problem.

1005
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,320
People are ready to give
as much as they have.

1006
01:43:34,355 --> 01:43:36,680
If Leszek was here...

1007
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,200
Maybe Mr. Czynski can help us?

1008
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:42,760
He saved their son too!

1009
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,700
They don't remember.

1010
01:43:45,735 --> 01:43:48,600
Neither their son.

1011
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,160
Come in.

1012
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,880
Your Highness, we are near the border.

1013
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,880
Thank you.

1014
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,760
Take it.

1015
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,800
You'll personally give it to Antoni.

1016
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,560
Thank you.

1017
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,280
I'll give him money, in your behalf.

1018
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,960
I thank you in his behalf.

1019
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,920
He'll clear the debts if
he'll thank me himself.

1020
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,840
All these should release him.

1021
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,800
Oh, Sonia, why are
you managing all these?

1022
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,400
Who else?

1023
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:19,520
I will.

1024
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,020
You?
- Yes...

1025
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:25,080
Are you gonna stay
with us for three years?

1026
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,280
No. I was thinking that after the
appeal, Antoni will be released.

1027
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,285
How can you tell?

1028
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:39,680
How will you survive?

1029
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:46,680
Don't cry.

1030
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:54,600
Stop. No one will drive
you away from here.

1031
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,800
There's a roof over your head...

1032
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,800
...and food, also, is enough.

1033
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,560
Why is she crying?

1034
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,120
What did you tell her?

1035
01:47:13,155 --> 01:47:14,640
It's not your business.

1036
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,360
She got angry.

1037
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,200
She's like a burden to us.

1038
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,760
Not for you.

1039
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,800
But for who? Let her leave.

1040
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,400
She? Look here! Maybe
you'll go before her.

1041
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:27,080
Come in.

1042
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:31,400
The carriage is ready, your highness.

1043
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,760
And the roses?

1044
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,120
I cut them, as you ordered.

1045
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,525
They are in the carriage.

1046
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,800
What should I tell to the countess?

1047
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,800
Anything.

1048
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
It's all right, Frantisheck.

1049
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,080
Please, give it to my parents.

1050
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:03,480
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

1051
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,760
Listen, Frantisheck.

1052
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,800
Can you tell me where she was buried?

1053
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,960
Who?

1054
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,280
The girl who had that accident.

1055
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,200
What accident?

1056
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:26,040
The accident when she was with me.

1057
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,600
Oh God why do you say
that, your Highness.

1058
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:32,000
She wasn't buried?

1059
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,920
She's alive!

1060
01:50:33,955 --> 01:50:35,920
What?

1061
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,960
- What?
- She's alive. I swear.

1062
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,200
Yes. Antoni cured her...

1063
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:48,200
...that quack from the mill.

1064
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:52,200
He lives there.

1065
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,920
Leszek, what does all
these flowers mean?

1066
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:01,800
Means that I will never forgive you!

1067
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:08,600
To the mill!

1068
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:24,360
Frantisheck. What happened?

1069
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,125
I don't know. Mr. Leszek told me.

1070
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:30,720
...to prepare the carriage and to
cut all the roses in the garden.

1071
01:51:30,755 --> 01:51:33,320
He then asked where Marysia is burried.

1072
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:34,720
And I told him that she's alive.

1073
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:40,800
Go on.

1074
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,640
We should have told him.

1075
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,680
We thought that this
little romance was finished.

1076
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,600
But if this is not only an
adventure but a deeper feeling?

1077
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:49,760
You make me laugh.

1078
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:51,760
Forgive me, your Highnesses.

1079
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:55,800
I completely forgot. Mr. Leszek
asked me to give it to you.

1080
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:07,960
What happened?

1081
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Speak up. You scare me.

1082
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:16,080
I don't have my glasses.

1083
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,920
Sit down, Eleonora.

1084
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,640
<i>My dear parents...</i>

1085
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,200
<i>When you'll read this letter...</i>

1086
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,680
<i>...your son will not be alive.</i>

1087
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,960
<i>I love you very much and I know</i>

1088
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,160
<i>...that I'm causing suffering to you.</i>

1089
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:32,720
<i>Please forgive but I
can't live without her.</i>

1090
01:52:32,755 --> 01:52:35,085
<i>My life lost any sense.</i>

1091
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:40,160
<i>I was gonna do it
earlier, but before dying...</i>

1092
01:52:40,195 --> 01:52:42,165
<i>I wish to visit her grave...</i>

1093
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,280
<i>with the request to
carry out one last wish.</i>

1094
01:52:44,315 --> 01:52:48,680
<i>Bury me next to her. Leszek.</i>

1095
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,400
We almost killed our son.

1096
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,600
No. I can't believe it. It's absurd!

1097
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
Leszek would never do that!

1098
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:01,960
Don't you understand...

1099
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,200
...that we can lose him?

1100
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,640
How's that?

1101
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,360
He knows that she's alive!

1102
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,400
He'll never forgive us for hiding it.

1103
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:15,680
Oh, God.

1104
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,760
What to do?

1105
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,800
Why are you leaving? Stay here.

1106
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,400
I can't. I have to go.

1107
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:36,840
So you've decided...

1108
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,880
...let's sit, before you go.

1109
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,400
Faster, faster!

1110
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,960
My love...

1111
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
My prince. My darling.

1112
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,040
You grizzled.

1113
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,800
They told that you were dead.

1114
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,800
No. I have waited so long.

1115
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:10,600
I thought, I knew...

1116
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I'll never leave you again.

1117
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,800
Come in.

1118
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:00,440
Son.

1119
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:03,600
Present to us, please, your future wife.

1120
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,405
Mr. Antoni.

1121
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:29,360
Don't you remember me?

1122
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:32,240
- Hello, Mr. Kosiba.
- Hello.

1123
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:35,560
How do you feel?

1124
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:39,200
Fine. Like in a jail.

1125
01:56:39,235 --> 01:56:42,800
You're very beautiful.

1126
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,440
Because of a blessed event.

1127
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:50,600
Marysia accepted to be my wife.

1128
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,800
To tell the truth, I wasn't
expecting this at all.

1129
01:56:58,835 --> 01:57:00,120
Well, congratulations.

1130
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,200
Be happy.

1131
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,000
Thank you.

1132
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,760
From both of us.

1133
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:07,760
Your trial will be
evaluated soon enough.

1134
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:11,200
The lawyers agree that they
can clarify some things.

1135
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,140
Is it worth trying?

1136
01:57:13,175 --> 01:57:15,040
Why do you say that?

1137
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,480
You also saved me.

1138
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,880
Please, let us do this for you.

1139
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:23,440
We called for a professor
in medicine, from Warsaw.

1140
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:27,400
I have no doubt that
you treated them right.

1141
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:31,400
If we don't solve
anything, it doesn't matter.

1142
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:37,000
We don't have anything to lose.

1143
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:51,080
Mr. Pawlicki. Are there
many quacks in our county?

1144
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,680
I don't know exactly, but there
are about 20 quacks in every county.

1145
01:57:53,715 --> 01:57:56,520
They're more like a plague.

1146
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,000
As you know, from
interventions made by them...

1147
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:02,165
...by unprofessional actions,
any death was recorded?

1148
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:06,600
Of course. Moreover, according
to statistics of our county...

1149
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:10,600
...about 200 people died after
these so called "treatments".

1150
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,680
Thank you. No further questions.

1151
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,440
Mr. Pawlicki.

1152
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,800
You said that often people suffered.

1153
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:22,000
...from quacks who treated them.

1154
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:23,440
Yes.

1155
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:27,480
Do you know any victims
of Antoni Kosiba?

1156
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,280
It's hard to remember.

1157
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,160
Is that so...

1158
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:36,040
Answer me, have you ever heard about
a single death caused by my client?

1159
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,440
No.

1160
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,480
Thank you. No further questions.

1161
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:47,560
I request the hearing of an expert
specially called from Warsaw...

1162
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:52,720
...professor Dobraniecki, the president
of the Association of Polish Surgeons.

1163
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:58,400
Here you go.

1164
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,040
Your Honours.

1165
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:09,080
I was asked to examine certain persons...

1166
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:15,080
who suffered serious injuries
and to draw out the conclusions.

1167
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,440
...regarding the surgeries that were made.

1168
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,840
All of these performed by
the quack Antoni Kosiba.

1169
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:29,725
I carried out careful tests and X-rays.

1170
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:34,040
which provide us the answer that,
all the surgeries were carried out...

1171
01:59:34,075 --> 01:59:38,005
...at a high level of professionalism,
which, unquestionable...

1172
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:42,800
...represent an excellent knowledge
of human anatomy. Yes, excellent.

1173
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:46,600
Many of the patients would not
survive without this knowledge.

1174
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,800
Professor, you say that...

1175
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:54,960
...this person which has no
special training whatsoever...

1176
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:58,125
...made complex...

1177
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:01,800
...advanced and very risky surgeries?

1178
02:00:01,835 --> 02:00:05,440
Frankly, it's above my understanding.

1179
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:09,880
This quack has either a huge experience...

1180
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,360
...or an extraordinary talent...

1181
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,400
...blended with an intuition
which only a few surgeons have.

1182
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:21,200
In my life, I saw only one surgeon.

1183
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:24,600
with such an amazing
and ingenious intuition.

1184
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:26,760
Thank you.

1185
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:30,200
The other party has any questions?

1186
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,965
Professor...

1187
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,205
As an expert of medical
ethics, please tell us...

1188
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:41,360
...if you agree with theft for
the sake of life salvation?

1189
02:00:41,395 --> 02:00:42,725
Objection!

1190
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:46,720
What ethics, if the accused
doesn't have a doctor diploma?

1191
02:00:46,755 --> 02:00:49,040
Objection overruled.

1192
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:54,760
In the history of medicine,
I never seen such cases.

1193
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,800
Personally, I think, that none
is more precious than human life.

1194
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,400
Thank you, professor.

1195
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,160
We've listened both parties.

1196
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:15,200
Now the court wants to
talk with the lawyer.

1197
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,240
No...

1198
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,280
I don't have anything to say.

1199
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:41,880
I request the permission
to show some evidence.

1200
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:46,080
...of Antoni Kosiba's talent and skill.

1201
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:50,400
I present you a man which the
doctor considered to be hopeless.

1202
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,800
Please.

1203
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:05,880
Name and surname.

1204
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,760
Maria Wilczur.

1205
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:11,080
Louder, please.

1206
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:14,400
Maria lolanta Wilczur.

1207
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:23,400
Wilczur...

1208
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:38,480
Excuse me.

1209
02:02:38,515 --> 02:02:41,760
Dear judges...

1210
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:45,800
...he's professor Rafal Wilczur.

1211
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:56,680
My girl...

1212
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,800
My little girl...

1213
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:34,600
I want you to be happier than we were.
