1
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,140
All right, Griff, get your horse
back in the gate.

2
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,543
Is my fly open again?

3
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,579
I'm talking about your shoe horse,
you big Airedale.

4
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,061
The blubber-aerobics class next door
is getting ready to start...

5
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,101
- ...in a couple of seconds.
- All right.

6
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,306
So, what we got riding on this one,
big Al?

7
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,860
Loser gets to use the bathroom last.

8
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,539
Stinky seconds?

9
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,101
You bet.

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,787
Let's rock.

11
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,941
Three, two, one...

12
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,343
- ...and they're off.
- Come on, Seattle Shoe.

13
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,427
- Go, Knockout, go.
- Come on, Seattle Shoe.

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,860
- Come on, Knockout.
- Come on, Seattle Shoe.

15
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,107
- Yeah. Come on.
- Papa needs a new pair--

16
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,064
- What happened?
- Well, the hungry hippos over there...

17
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,943
...worked out
for a whole seven seconds.

18
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,509
It's probably time for a cheese break.

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,105
How are we gonna settle
this race now?

20
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,181
I got an idea.

21
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,659
Free jerk chicken
at the food court, man.

22
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,186
I won! I won!

23
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,307
I win.

24
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,587
I won the Shoetucky Derby.

25
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,821
But I was ahead.

26
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,469
Did you cheat?

27
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,543
Is this the face of a cheater?

28
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,707
Am I gonna have to check
that surveillance camera again?

29
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,540
All right. I cheated.

30
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,065
And I ate your lunch.

31
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,586
Drank your vanilla shake.

32
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,663
Al, that was Kaopectate.

33
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,901
Still the best lunch I've had in years.

34
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,142
Oh, will you look at those karate cows
hoofing it over to self-defense class?

35
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,383
Or, as they call it,
tae kwon doughnut.

36
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,180
Can you believe Gary's charging
250 bucks for that class?

37
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,990
It's still less than a dollar a pound.

38
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,785
What a stupid waste of money.

39
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,146
Hey, speaking of waste of money.

40
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,946
Al, I need $250.

41
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,065
You're not taking
that self-defense class, are you?

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,181
No. I'm buying you
a very special gift.

43
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,304
Of course I'm taking
the self-defense class.

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,904
Marcie already signed me up.

45
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,464
Peg, I'm not wasting my money
like I wasted my youth, on you.

46
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,669
Self-defense is not a waste of money.

47
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,468
We live in a bad neighborhood.

48
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,224
Peg, you live on the couch.

49
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,583
The only danger you face...

50
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,702
...is getting your head stuck
in a Häagen-Dazs carton.

51
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,428
Peg, let's face it, evolution
has only equipped you women...

52
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,463
...made you strong enough,
to roll out of bed in the morning...

53
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,343
...squeeze yourself into a girdle,
ooze down the stairs...

54
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,984
...and fry your man up a Pop-Tart.

55
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,223
Peg, the truth is
no woman could ever take a man.

56
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,064
You'd back me up on that,
wouldn't you, Hans?

57
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,743
You see, Peg...

58
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,742
...we men are bigger...

59
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,584
...we're stronger, we're tougher...

60
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,343
...we're--

61
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,340
Dead meat.

62
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,426
Al, guess what?

63
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,628
You got your black belt in nag fu.

64
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,306
Marcie and I have been promoted
to the advanced self-defense class.

65
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,222
Aren't you happy for me?

66
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,779
Do I look like a happy man?

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,069
You don't even look like
a happy tree stump.

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,504
I'm gonna go outside
and practice my kicks with Marcie.

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,947
Look, this self-defense class
of yours is taking up way too much...

70
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,226
...of your time and my paycheque.

71
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,189
I haven't been able to find my left shoe
in three days.

72
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,742
Now, as the breadwinner
and king of my castle, I demand--

73
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,545
To be left alone.

74
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,668
Good. Where's the shoe?

75
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,823
Dad, if you're looking for a place
to stick your head, I suggest the oven.

76
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,298
I'm looking for my shoe.

77
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,543
It's a good thing we have Lucky.

78
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,627
- Maybe he can track it down for you.
- Yeah.

79
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,786
Let me get this old shoe
out of his mouth...

80
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,469
...and he'll be ready for action.

81
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,985
Oh, pumpkin, that's my shoe.

82
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,507
Oh, Lucky, you found it right away.

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,866
Good boy.

84
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,060
Now we know he can chew.
Maybe next time he'll go for my throat.

85
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,263
<i>Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat pork.</i>

86
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,262
Dad, you look sad. What is it?

87
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,819
- It's your mother.
- What'd she do?

88
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,949
Well, the trouble started this morning
when I woke up...

89
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,148
...and so did she.
You know how much I hate that.

90
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,506
I think I know what it is, Daddy.

91
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,269
You're just feeling lonely...

92
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,904
...because ever since Mom
started taking her class...

93
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,862
...she hasn't paid you any attention.

94
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,221
Isn't that it, you big galoot?

95
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,220
No, I like that part. I also like the part
she's too tired at night...

96
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,307
...to wanna fool around.

97
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,141
I do kind of miss her
calling me bullet head, though.

98
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,182
Look, Daddy, a little lesson in women:
All Mom wants is just a little tenderness.

99
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,704
If you really want Mom to stop
taking karate, you gotta take her out.

100
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,420
Well, don't you think I would
if I thought I could get away with it?

101
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,908
Dad, I think she means, you know,
take her out on a date...

102
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,266
- Yeah.
- ...and show her some affection.

103
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,021
Romantic movies
always work for me.

104
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,058
A Happy Meal and a Hello Kitty pen set
works for you, Kelly.

105
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,705
<i>Look, why don't you take Mom to go
see The Bridges Of Madison County.</i>

106
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,987
Now, I heard there's a new director's cut
with 11 extra minutes...

107
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,500
...of Clint Eastwood
sponge-bathing Meryl Streep.

108
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,624
Is there no other way?

109
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,906
Well, you could make love to her
all night.

110
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,109
Well, either way, I'll be eating
Junior Mints and crying in the dark.

111
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,062
<i>All right.
Bridges of Madison County it is.</i>

112
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,699
Oh, that was so much fun.

113
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,346
Thanks for being
such a good sport, Jefferson.

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,581
No problem.

115
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,702
You know, just between you and me...

116
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,141
...these workouts
are starting to turn me on.

117
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,543
- So, what do you say?
- I say I need a flashlight.

118
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,062
I think some of my equipment
rolled under the house.

119
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,420
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

120
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,109
<i>...reporting to you live at the premiere
of The Bridges of Madison County...</i>

121
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,022
<i>...The Director's Cut.</i>

122
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,784
As you can see,
the re-release of this movie...

123
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,419
...has generated
unbelievable excitement.

124
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,423
I'm unbelievably excited, you know...

125
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,549
Oh, Al, isn't this romantic?

126
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,180
Finally you're taking me to a movie
that doesn't have the words "Debbie"...

127
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,665
...or "does" in the title.

128
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,108
I just can't figure out why you insisted
on taking me the night of my class.

129
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,467
Pookie, tomorrow I may not be
in the mood to see Meryl and Clint...

130
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,349
...playing Hide the Loofa
in the bathtub.

131
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,141
Oh, my God, I'm in line to watch
Meryl Streep strip.

132
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,229
No bloody way.

133
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,222
Yeah, sure, go ahead,
take the easy way out.

134
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,110
I just hope
I don't fall behind in class.

135
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,228
Today was nunchak-to-the-nads day.

136
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,069
Don't you understand, Peg?

137
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,830
This women's self-defense
is against nature.

138
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,504
Take the mighty wildebeest,
for example.

139
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,419
He hunts while the wildebeestess
just stays on her couch...

140
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,343
...watching the Oprah-beestess.

141
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,467
Then there's the ant. She just
sits there all day and lays eggs...

142
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,821
...while the male is off dragging
those heavy Budweiser bottles...

143
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,258
...down that anthill.

144
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,980
- I'll give you another example--
- Hey.

145
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,426
This is the bravest thing
this reporter has seen...

146
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,100
...since Bill said,
"Hillary, I beg to differ."

147
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,628
This courageous woman
cold-cocked this low-life mugger...

148
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,661
...without any help whatsoever...

149
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,944
...from the weaselly man
who dares to call himself her husband.

150
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,382
Well, you got to admit, it's pithy.

151
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,667
Jefferson, don't you understand
the problem?

152
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,069
If this gets around town, people
are gonna start thinking I'm a nerd.

153
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,069
Well, technically, Al,
you're not smart enough to be a nerd.

154
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,384
No, no, you're more of a pantywaist...

155
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,741
...or a limp-wristed sissy boy.

156
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,421
Horse feathers, Jefferson.
I could have taken that mugger. I just--

157
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,069
I didn't have time to react.

158
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,022
Hey, I believe you, buddy.
It's the rest of Chicago...

159
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,182
...that thinks Al is short for Alice.

160
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,901
You gotta understand, when I felt
that hairy hand go in my pocket...

161
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,260
...I naturally assumed it was Peg.

162
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,226
Don't worry, Al.
It was just a little mugging.

163
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,825
I mean, how much more press
could it possibly get?

164
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,984
Great news, Al.

165
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,107
<i>Good Morning, Chicago
wants to do an interview.</i>

166
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,342
Fine. I'd like to set the record straight.
I am no wimp.

167
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,185
Could a wimp score four touchdowns
in one game?

168
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,547
Was that Pee Wee football
or Powderpuff?

169
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,789
I'm sorry.
We're here to interview your wife.

170
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,339
Would you be a doll
and brew us up some coffee?

171
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,582
And feel free to make
some herbal tea for yourself.

172
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,188
All right. Come on, Al.

173
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,627
Hey. Hey, I think I know
how to put an end to all of this.

174
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,985
Well, if you've got the tailpipe,
I've got the lips.

175
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,740
Let's assume for the sake of argument
that you are stronger than Peggy.

176
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,345
I am stronger, damn it!

177
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,549
Well, you know that
and I'm willing to play along.

178
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,180
- But you have to prove it to the public.
- You want me to fight Peg on TV?

179
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,028
- Love it.
- No.

180
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,105
No. No. You gotta fight someone else.

181
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,908
But can I still fight Peg?

182
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,268
No, Al. Look, we have to stage a fight
even you can win.

183
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,948
Okay. Look.
I have this stuntman friend.

184
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,102
His name is Thunder, okay?
You go to this bar, he comes up.

185
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,148
- He insults Peggy.
- And I buy him a drink?

186
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,699
Later. First, you hit him with your
best shot. He pretends to be hurt.

187
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,340
He falls down. You're out
of the Michael Bolton fan club.

188
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,668
That's a good idea.

189
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,299
That's a good idea.
And I can have Bud come in...

190
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,909
- ...and video the thing.
- Yeah.

191
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,748
Then I'll fight Peg.

192
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,584
That will work, but how can I
recognize your buddy?

193
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,779
Oh, well, Thunder has a goatee,
wears a bandana...

194
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,784
...and he reeks of that cologne,
Obsession for Men.

195
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,788
Excuse me.

196
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,108
You may go.

197
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,106
Al, I thought you were taking me out
for a nice, romantic dinner.

198
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,341
We are, Peg. I just wanna...

199
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,423
...soak up the atmosphere here.

200
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,859
Obsession for Men?

201
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,661
Well, I experimented a little in college,
but it was just a phase.

202
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,026
Honey, I wanna go freshen up.
You think the ladies' room is free?

203
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,581
It's free.

204
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,903
Dad, can we get this thing over with?

205
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,665
It's kind of sleazy in here and,
frankly, it's a little scary.

206
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,980
I don't wanna be in here
any more than you do.

207
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,865
What kind of low-life loser would
voluntarily come in a dump like this?

208
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,989
Oh, this isn't the library.

209
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,229
We must be in the wrong place,
study buddy.

210
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,980
I thought we were gonna get hammered
and do it on the "Pac-Man."

211
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,384
But that book must be checked out.

212
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,985
Why don't we go to the other library
down the street?

213
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,300
The one with the Jell-O shots? Cool.

214
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,264
Well, she's moving on up.
She used to only date senators.

215
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,506
Bud, here comes your mother.
Go hide.

216
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,308
How am I gonna know when to start?

217
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,748
When I say to this guy, Thunder,
"I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."

218
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,468
Hey, Al, how come on the wall
next to the pay phone...

219
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,020
...it says, for a good time,
call our house?

220
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,704
Beats me. I never
had a good time there.

221
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,421
What will you have?

222
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,264
<i>Did you call my wife an ugly, useless,
lazy, Oprah-watching...</i>

223
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,183
...bonbon-eating couch loafer?

224
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,500
No, I said, "What will you have?"

225
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,908
One of your finest beers.
Nothing for the wife.

226
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,985
You're cute.

227
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,788
Wanna ride a hog?

228
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,426
- Well, all right, then.
- No, no, no. Mommy, daddy!

229
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,899
Al, what are you doing?

230
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,665
You take me out at night
and sniff other men?

231
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,307
I'm not sniffing them, Peg.

232
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,668
It's a male thing.
Shows dominance in the territory.

233
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,220
Well, you're not gonna lift
your leg on a chair, are you?

234
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,660
I'm Thunder. Sorry I'm late.

235
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,263
Your wife.

236
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,630
Your wife's a tacky,
chocolate-snarfing, couch-butted...

237
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,226
...beehive-headed parasite.

238
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,780
No one calls my wife a tacky,
chocolate-snarfing, couch-butted...

239
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:32,787
...beehive-headed parasite
who snores louder than a logging mill.

240
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,424
Al, he didn't say that.

241
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,230
No, but he was gonna say it
if I hadn't stopped him.

242
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,349
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- What am I gonna do about it?

243
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,865
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do about it.

244
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,143
Oh, no, please don't.
You're hurting me!

245
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,660
I s41d, I'll t3ll y0v
wh4t I'm gonna do about it, Bud!

246
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,546
- Okay, Dad.
- Now...

247
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,222
...would you mind repeating
what you just said to my wife.

248
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,903
Well, I forgot.

249
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,825
- A chocolate-snarfing--
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

250
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,301
A couch-butted,
beehive-headed parasite.

251
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,063
All right?

252
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,024
You asked for this, pal.

253
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,062
One...

254
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,949
...two--

255
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,908
Three.

256
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,983
I got it. Good night.

257
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,943
You ever think about
just getting a perm?

258
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,227
And selling Mary Kay cosmetics?

259
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,984
They give you a pink car.

260
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,347
Tell me, Mrs. Bundy, has your husband
always been more Lois than Clark?

261
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,979
Now, look here, Miranda.

262
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,901
If you really want some film at 11...

263
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,300
...why don't you follow me
down to the brewery.

264
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,661
I'll tie a bowling ball to my ankle,
dive in a vat of beer.

265
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,540
I'll leave this world the same way
I entered my marriage, dead drunk.

266
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,782
Hey, I thought you said I could have
your bowling ball when you die.

267
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,504
- Don't you push it, Jefferson.
- Hey, come on.

268
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,299
- Daddy?
- You wanna kick me while I'm down?

269
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,184
No, that's Mom's job.

270
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,623
Now, you remember Genghis
from the library, right?

271
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,267
Okay, go ahead Gengie.

272
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,061
Mr. Bundy...

273
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,304
...would you give me your hand
in daughter marriage?

274
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,389
You know, Genghis,
your timing couldn't be better.

275
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,029
You wanna do me a favor, son?

276
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,065
You wanna say what you just said to me
in front of the camera here?

277
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,823
Sure, Dad.

278
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,823
Hey, and better still,
hold my wallet.

279
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,549
Cool.

280
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,550
- Call my wife an idiot.
- Okay.

281
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,543
Mrs. Bundy...

282
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,581
...you're an idiot.

283
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,342
That's good.
