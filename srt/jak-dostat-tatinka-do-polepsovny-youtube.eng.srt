1
0:0:41,293 --> 0:0:47,246
Children, before you hand in your drawings, be sure to sign your name.

2
0:0:48,377 --> 0:0:53,692
But I still don't know where I'm going on holiday!

3
0:0:54,940 --> 0:1:1,577
Vasek, what did you spend an hour drawing? Where are you going with your dad and mom?

4
0:1:2,704 --> 0:1:6,096
Their honeymoon!

5
0:1:9,108 --> 0:1:12,908
Why did you agree to such nonsense?

6
0:1:13,030 --> 0:1:19,553
Going on holiday and not knowing where! What if you forget something you need?

7
0:1:20,074 --> 0:1:24,651
You know what? I'll take everything I need and a bit more!

8
0:1:24,777 --> 0:1:30,538
Lubos hasn't mentioned at all where you're going? At least you'd have an idea!

9
0:1:32,161 --> 0:1:34,357
I have quite an accurate an idea!

10
0:1:34,482 --> 0:1:42,563
I'll lie down on the grass and just sleep. Let Lubos enjoy our little child.

11
0:1:43,567 --> 0:1:50,204
Sleep, you say? And for this you need a new wardrobe?

12
0:1:50,331 --> 0:1:56,204
That's not all! I decided I'll be partying a lot.

13
0:1:56,334 --> 0:2:4,451
No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning! I don't want to even see a kitchen.

14
0:2:4,979 --> 0:2:11,802
~ Oh, you're going to Bermuda?
~ I deserve a bit of a rest!

15
0:2:11,923 --> 0:2:19,056
All year it's just drill at the ballet hall, lots of stress at home and on the stage.

16
0:2:19,187 --> 0:2:21,960
I want to live at last, too!

17
0:2:22,089 --> 0:2:29,168
~ Isn't it perfect?
~ Sure it is! Perfect for a mountain tour!

18
0:2:29,593 --> 0:2:36,035
~ What kind of tour?
~ Oh come on! Where did you meet? In the mountains.

19
0:2:36,156 --> 0:2:41,279
- This year, you met again after eight years...
- ...after nine years.
- ...after nine years, where? In the mountains.

20
0:2:41,639 --> 0:2:48,082
If you're saying Lubos is a snow man, he's not!

21
0:2:48,203 --> 0:2:50,683
~ He was in Prague this spring.
~ He was, a few days.

22
0:2:50,805 --> 0:2:53,278
Only to prepare an expedition to the Alps!

23
0:2:53,406 --> 0:2:58,658
~ And in the meantime, he's poking at the soil under the glacier.
~ So what?

24
0:2:58,889 --> 0:3:3,947
Anna, you know you have a child with a chief of mountain rescue?

25
0:3:5,373 --> 0:3:8,046
But otherwise, Lubos is normal!

26
0:3:8,174 --> 0:3:13,474
If you assume he's going to put you on the train to the mountains, everything's fine.

27
0:3:13,597 --> 0:3:20,840
Definitely not! We wrote to him three times insisting that we're not going to the mountains!

28
0:3:20,961 --> 0:3:25,219
I'm not going to risk he'll turn Vasek into a climber!

29
0:3:25,344 --> 0:3:31,596
~ What about sending Vasek with me to the cottage?
~ Absolutely not!

30
0:3:32,528 --> 0:3:35,840
Do you even understand the situation you're in?

31
0:3:36,370 --> 0:3:41,210
Starting to live with a man after eight years isn't easy.

32
0:3:41,533 --> 0:3:44,864
Especially when you should get married ASAP.

33
0:3:44,995 --> 0:3:51,649
First I'll get to know Lubos! Then I'll think about the wedding!

34
0:3:51,778 --> 0:3:58,733
What about Vasek? The marriage will have to be by the end holidays, before he goes back to school!

35
0:3:58,862 --> 0:4:5,495
~ I've tripped a few times in my life! Now I have to decide properly!
~ Decide?

36
0:4:5,626 --> 0:4:12,105
You're twenty-eight, you have an eight-year-old son, and when his father wants to marry you, you want to "think about it"?

37
0:4:12,230 --> 0:4:17,808
What's to decide? Whether you're in love with him?

38
0:4:18,333 --> 0:4:26,209
That hardly matters, but I just need to know I can rely on him.

39
0:4:29,099 --> 0:4:35,736
Mom, why such a big suitcase? And where did you put those old pants?

40
0:4:36,103 --> 0:4:41,339
Colombo, let that suitcase be.
And tidy up those things!

41
0:4:43,167 --> 0:4:50,703
~ Why should I take those old pants?
~ To be able to climb the mountains.

42
0:4:50,931 --> 0:4:56,107
~ Your father wrote that to you?
~ No, I came up with it myself!

43
0:4:58,716 --> 0:5:4,237
~ What did he write you in the last letter?
~ That's a secret!

44
0:5:5,159 --> 0:5:11,633
~ A great adventure awaits us!
~ Good! Now go wash!

45
0:5:11,763 --> 0:5:18,285
~ Mommy, don't go anywhere!
~ Don't be silly?
~ But I won't be able to fall asleep!

46
0:5:18,406 --> 0:5:24,724
Close your eyes and you can dream that our holiday begins tomorrow!

47
0:5:24,850 --> 0:5:31,530
~ That we're all three together!
~ And when you wake up in the morning...
~ ...Dad's coming! ~ Yeah!

48
0:5:32,054 --> 0:5:34,695
But I can't wait until the morning!

49
0:6:18,440 --> 0:6:22,111
That was the nicest performance of the season!

50
0:6:22,542 --> 0:6:24,818
I know!

51
0:6:25,544 --> 0:6:28,355
Because it was the last!

52
0:6:35,489 --> 0:6:39,963
Bozenka, did I leave the big blue towel lying there?

53
0:6:40,092 --> 0:6:43,609
It's by the mirror or on the couch!

54
0:6:51,818 --> 0:6:54,254
This is a very nice welcome, after 3 months!

55
0:6:54,380 --> 0:6:59,031
Haven't I imagined this moment a hundred times a day?!

56
0:6:59,763 --> 0:7:4,539
I had no idea you would scream so nicely!

57
0:7:4,665 --> 0:7:9,742
~ Why are there are seven beds?
~ Seven climbers!
~ Where are they?

58
0:7:9,868 --> 0:7:15,691
~ Six on the train, and the seventh in the bathroom!
~ You could shower at home!

59
0:7:15,812 --> 0:7:20,126
~ Vasek can't wait to see you!
~ And you can?

60
0:7:21,735 --> 0:7:28,618
Me? What about me? I'll wait for you outside!

61
0:7:29,039 --> 0:7:32,156
There's a bathroom!

62
0:7:38,284 --> 0:7:42,997
You look like you did when you were seventeen!

63
0:7:44,207 --> 0:7:49,843
Back then, I was nineteen and three months. Don't stare at me!

64
0:7:50,271 --> 0:7:54,372
Finish up! I want to be out of here before the climbers get back.

65
0:7:54,493 --> 0:8:2,116
~ Relax, the boys won't be here until the morning!
~ How is it that you're here?

66
0:8:2,337 --> 0:8:8,974
~ Please don't mention it to Vasek! He'd be heartbroken.
~ Wait!

67
0:8:9,201 --> 0:8:14,733
That's why you came early, to tell us you can't go on holiday with us?

68
0:8:14,864 --> 0:8:23,428
No! I thought this night could be more than just the start of a holiday.

69
0:8:45,281 --> 0:8:48,559
Dad! Dad's here!

70
0:8:52,365 --> 0:8:56,042
Three, two, one!

71
0:8:56,968 --> 0:9:0,368
~ Mom's asleep?
~ Like a log, but we'll get her up.

72
0:9:0,490 --> 0:9:5,291
~ Leave that to me!
~ What's the surprise?
~ At the front of the house.

73
0:9:5,312 --> 0:9:11,613
~ Are you packed? ~ I have a backpack.
~ And Mom? ~ She has a whole suitcase.

74
0:9:11,736 --> 0:9:19,539
~ And your climbing gear? Do you have that?
~ Yeah, but don't tell Mom so that she doesn't panic!

75
0:9:34,989 --> 0:9:39,861
~ Do I have to go home?
~ No, but you have to get up.

76
0:9:40,832 --> 0:9:44,383
~ What time is it?
~ Past seven.

77
0:9:47,376 --> 0:9:52,974
~ How did I get home?
~ Don't you remember anything?

78
0:9:53,099 --> 0:9:59,280
There! And for me the three hours were like an eternity without you!

79
0:9:59,703 --> 0:10:3,821
Quiet! Vasek could wake up.

80
0:10:3,845 --> 0:10:9,486
~ Mom, Mom, I got a new bike!
~ Maybe you behaved well.

81
0:10:9,608 --> 0:10:13,849
~ You must have behaved well, too!
~ Why?
~ You got a bike as well!

82
0:10:13,971 --> 0:10:19,844
~ A bike? What for?
~ So that you don't feel jealous.
~ That's what dad says.

83
0:10:20,874 --> 0:10:27,675
What a silly idea to buy bikes before a holiday... do you want to lug them around on the train?

84
0:10:27,798 --> 0:10:35,311
~ No, the train will only take your suitcase.
~ Huge suitcase! ~ What about us?
~ We'll go by bike.

85
0:10:35,943 --> 0:10:40,814
~ Bikes, great!
~ Didn't I tell you?
~ No, you didn't tell me!

86
0:10:41,246 --> 0:10:47,138
And the next time, don't even try. There's no way you two can get me on a bike!

87
0:11:36,436 --> 0:11:38,093
Will there be wilderness?

88
0:11:38,217 --> 0:11:42,770
~ Wilderness for you, paradise for Mom.
~ I'm so curious, I can't wait.

89
0:11:42,800 --> 0:11:49,333
~ If we can ride tomorrow as far as today, we'll be there by the evening.
~ Are you kidding me?

90
0:11:49,464 --> 0:11:55,542
I would also say that real adventure is rather farther.
In the Himalayas. Or in Africa.

91
0:11:55,767 --> 0:12:3,580
~ Adventure is not anywhere. You have to have it in your blood.
~ I have that! ~ Me, too!

92
0:12:3,812 --> 0:12:7,784
This means Mom doesn't have to ride the bike to Africa nor Asia.

93
0:12:7,914 --> 0:12:10,910
Oh now I'm much happier.

94
0:12:11,036 --> 0:12:16,389
People sometimes think the farther away from home you are, the greater the adventure.

95
0:12:16,419 --> 0:12:23,080
~ But the greatest wonders of nature lie close by.
~ Maybe a boar! ~ Maybe.

96
0:12:23,603 --> 0:12:27,743
Being able to look around is the secret of an adventurer!

97
0:12:27,865 --> 0:12:35,039
- Tomorrow I'm looking around a hotel room and getting in a hot bath.
- It's not exactly a hotel...

98
0:12:35,169 --> 0:12:38,028
I don't mind, at least there'll be a bathroom.

99
0:12:45,655 --> 0:12:49,411
I hope you don't expect me to sleep under a tent the whole holidays.

100
0:12:49,437 --> 0:12:55,390
Don't fret! You'll have a room that'll knock your eyes out!

101
0:13:57,335 --> 0:14:0,431
I give up! Put up the tent!

102
0:14:0,857 --> 0:14:7,057
~ I can't! You can't camp in a nature reserve.
~ What do you mean?

103
0:14:7,480 --> 0:14:14,613
~ Are we going to spend the night in a tree?
~ Do you see that light?

104
0:14:18,486 --> 0:14:24,345
~ Do you think they'll let us sleep there?
~ I'll go check it out!

105
0:14:26,671 --> 0:14:30,825
I don't like knocking on strangers' doors.

106
0:14:33,074 --> 0:14:36,034
Go with the flow!

107
0:14:46,662 --> 0:14:49,879
Hello! Hello! Colombo here!

108
0:14:51,705 --> 0:14:53,856
Where are you?

109
0:15:1,170 --> 0:15:4,209
Help me, I can't get out!

110
0:15:4,332 --> 0:15:8,689
~ What are you doing?
~ Lubos, hello!
~ Hey, Dad!

111
0:15:8,814 --> 0:15:13,349
Folks, Krkonos Mountain has fallen! Our boy found his way home!

112
0:15:13,477 --> 0:15:15,517
I came to show you my bride!

113
0:15:18,340 --> 0:15:22,540
Bride? So then, welcome to our home!

114
0:15:26,584 --> 0:15:30,518
Beník, he'll probably be my grandfather!

115
0:15:33,768 --> 0:15:42,153
Make yourself at home... here's the living room and here's the kitchen!

116
0:15:43,514 --> 0:15:48,112
As you can see, here you'll find everything you need!

117
0:15:51,598 --> 0:15:56,959
This was my kingdom! Now it'll be yours!

118
0:15:57,081 --> 0:16:0,439
A practical dresser...

119
0:16:1,924 --> 0:16:5,965
For the second bed, I'll jump into the barn!

120
0:16:6,847 --> 0:16:9,362
A perfect closet!

121
0:16:9,488 --> 0:16:13,928
This is the room that'll make my eyes bug out?

122
0:16:13,950 --> 0:16:17,210
~ You don't like it?
~ Terribly!

123
0:16:18,133 --> 0:16:23,250
I can't be more amazed! I ride like a fool on a bike for two days.

124
0:16:23,376 --> 0:16:28,630
In the tent, ants crawl all over me, and now this? Is this the paradise of yours?

125
0:16:28,659 --> 0:16:33,477
Everything's yet to come! The two of us will be alone here!

126
0:16:35,302 --> 0:16:41,495
~ Can't you ever think of anything else?
~ Right now I just can't think at all!

127
0:16:42,626 --> 0:16:46,382
It's going to be a great holiday!

128
0:16:50,071 --> 0:16:54,289
~ Why doesn't it heat the water?
~ Because the stove doesn't work properly.

129
0:16:54,413 --> 0:16:57,544
~ How doesn't the stove work properly?
~ The chimney's crooked!

130
0:16:57,575 --> 0:17:3,016
~ Why is the chimney crooked?
~ Bloody hell, so much fuss around a bath.

131
0:17:3,738 --> 0:17:9,816
~ Vasek, where are you? Into the house!
~ I hope the boy's not going to bathe in the tub?

132
0:17:9,942 --> 0:17:16,321
~ Here you call *that* a tub?
~ Here, we wash under the pump.
~ So you've got the Middle Ages here.

133
0:17:16,445 --> 0:17:23,685
~ What do you mean?
~ That this place hasn't been cleaned since the 30-year war.

134
0:17:28,132 --> 0:17:34,405
~ Grandpa, look what I found in the loft!
~ I'm not your grandfather!

135
0:17:35,116 --> 0:17:40,749
~ Check out these muscles!
~ Wow, you've got great muscles, Grandpa!

136
0:17:40,979 --> 0:17:45,902
Listen, no boy has called me Grandpa, ever!

137
0:17:46,522 --> 0:17:51,463
~ Why would a stranger boy call you that, Grandpa?
~ Are you not a stranger boy?

138
0:17:51,585 --> 0:17:53,800
I'm yours!

139
0:17:53,906 --> 0:17:57,423
I sure knew how to choose, didn't I?

140
0:17:57,548 --> 0:18:4,071
~ Well, from the whole world, you couldn't have brought a greater treasure.
~ Don't say that!

141
0:18:4,492 --> 0:18:10,270
~ Anna's got as much steam as a locomotive.
~ Keep your compliments and heat up the stove.

142
0:18:10,395 --> 0:18:12,705
Well, I'll have to find the stove first.

143
0:18:12,836 --> 0:18:18,358
~ What do you mean by "grandpa"?
~ Lubos is my dad.

144
0:18:18,480 --> 0:18:24,718
His mom is my bride. No! My mom is his bride.

145
0:18:24,843 --> 0:18:31,558
~ Shut your mouth and be quiet!
~ So you've got to be my grandfather. You see?

146
0:18:34,729 --> 0:18:42,489
~ I'll be like your granddad.
~ Not like. You're already my real granddad!

147
0:18:42,613 --> 0:18:48,771
~ Shut your mouth and be quiet!
~ Do you understand?
~ No!

148
0:18:52,438 --> 0:18:57,261
No worries, Grandpa! The important thing is that you're glad you've got me.

149
0:18:57,381 --> 0:19:3,574
I did wish for a grandson, but a man. Not a sissy!

150
0:19:3,705 --> 0:19:9,066
~ I'm not a sissy.
~ You are! A big one!

151
0:19:12,510 --> 0:19:14,979
Vasek!

152
0:19:16,512 --> 0:19:18,891
You're not a sissy!

153
0:19:19,513 --> 0:19:22,610
Jesus Christ!

154
0:19:22,935 --> 0:19:26,646
What a man! Lubos, he's a great guy!

155
0:19:31,520 --> 0:19:34,100
Lubos, look at the guy!

156
0:19:34,222 --> 0:19:38,900
Dad, stop it! What are you doing?

157
0:19:40,445 --> 0:19:44,999
This isn't a grandfather, it's Herod!

158
0:19:45,008 --> 0:19:51,086
Anna, dear, the moon is full! It will be a beautiful summer night!

159
0:20:27,471 --> 0:20:31,831
I'm here! I saved you a place in bed!

160
0:20:33,675 --> 0:20:37,033
You're a good boy!

161
0:20:39,558 --> 0:20:46,798
~ Don't wake my mom!
~ Why aren't you asleep?
~ I knew you'd come to me!

162
0:20:46,922 --> 0:20:49,313
Just sleep, OK?

163
0:20:59,569 --> 0:21:5,391
Daddy, when I'm thinking about something, I find it hard to sleep! You, too?

164
0:21:5,813 --> 0:21:11,635
~ What are you thinking about now?
~ How to be a climber, when there aren't any mountains.

165
0:21:11,756 --> 0:21:16,753
~ Wait until morning!
~ Are there some mountains around? Hidden somewhere?
~ You'll see!

166
0:21:26,244 --> 0:21:32,436
~ We'll start training in the morning?
~ Maybe now!
~ Really?

167
0:21:32,567 --> 0:21:37,589
~ A proper climber sleeps as soon as he lies down.
~ It's not possible.

168
0:21:37,710 --> 0:21:40,469
If so, the best climber in the world would be our mom!

169
0:22:37,023 --> 0:22:43,216
~ So, the dragon loop! Now you!
~ There once was a princess.

170
0:22:43,347 --> 0:22:49,425
She went to the pond, but a sprite emerged and pulled her under.

171
0:22:49,550 --> 0:22:55,868
It wasn't a sprite, it was a dragon! That is why it's called a dragon loop.

172
0:22:55,994 --> 0:23:0,326
The knot should bind on the left. Now it won't open when you fall.

173
0:23:0,456 --> 0:23:3,067
Come on down! Home!

174
0:23:3,198 --> 0:23:6,673
~ Is it time for breakfast?
~ We'll leave after breakfast.

175
0:23:6,800 --> 0:23:11,414
~ Where are we going?
~ Come on!
~ To the train station!

176
0:23:12,143 --> 0:23:19,656
You've got another suitcase? One arrived this morning with the postman.

177
0:23:19,887 --> 0:23:22,859
Is that kid making a fool out of me?

178
0:23:23,809 --> 0:23:29,444
Of course he is. He takes after you.

179
0:23:35,936 --> 0:23:42,730
~ I told you what I don't want and why and you do the exact opposite!
~ These aren't mountains.

180
0:23:42,860 --> 0:23:48,576
I didn't want to go to the mountains and you take me to a cottage with this rock.

181
0:23:48,703 --> 0:23:56,216
The most beautiful place is where one is born! If I'd known you don't like it here, I'd have been born somewhere else.

182
0:23:56,347 --> 0:24:3,985
I survived the exhausting journey. I survived the room, I survived the grandpa! As I did this unmaintained place.

183
0:24:4,192 --> 0:24:7,072
But you're not going to make a climber out of the boy.

184
0:24:8,194 --> 0:24:13,396
I don't want to worry about him getting killed on a rock. Pack up, we're leaving!

185
0:24:13,817 --> 0:24:19,992
We can't, Mom! Dad told grandpa we'd be here for half the holidays!

186
0:24:20,120 --> 0:24:23,432
From now on, what I say goes!

187
0:24:24,263 --> 0:24:31,681
No, Mom! I'm not leaving Grandpa here! I'm friends with grandpa now.

188
0:24:31,807 --> 0:24:35,563
I always wanted a grandpa. Mommy!

189
0:24:40,051 --> 0:24:45,253
~ For half the holidays?
~ It doesn't matter, seeing how you are.

190
0:24:45,374 --> 0:24:51,514
Listen, you two! You can do what you want on the land below the cottage.

191
0:24:51,538 --> 0:24:58,211
But if I catch you on the rock by the pond... I'm serious!

192
0:24:58,242 --> 0:25:5,722
~ So, deal?
~ You can rely on me! ~ Not me!

193
0:25:6,346 --> 0:25:9,420
~ Well, we're leaving!
~ No!

194
0:25:10,869 --> 0:25:15,244
Me too, you can rely on me!

195
0:25:25,957 --> 0:25:29,110
~ Look, rocks.
~ Pedal!

196
0:25:36,563 --> 0:25:39,256
~ There's a rock!
~ Come on!

197
0:25:39,384 --> 0:25:42,105
There, too!

198
0:25:42,806 --> 0:25:47,929
~ Don't look and speed up.
~ Oh gosh, it's all rocks here!

199
0:25:48,209 --> 0:25:50,327
Speed up!

200
0:25:54,853 --> 0:26:1,790
Dad, wait! We'll just touch the rock, then we'll go!

201
0:26:1,917 --> 0:26:6,740
Don't! Are you trying to get me in trouble?

202
0:26:6,860 --> 0:26:11,140
Dad, I'm made for the rocks!

203
0:26:11,462 --> 0:26:17,340
~ Strength, intellect, agility, that's me.
~ But we promised.

204
0:26:17,466 --> 0:26:23,927
But only about the rock by the pond. About the other rocks, we didn't promise.

205
0:26:24,349 --> 0:26:28,231
Mom doesn't know the shortcut to the village.

206
0:26:29,892 --> 0:26:34,385
You said that a good climber must overcome each obstacle.

207
0:26:35,416 --> 0:26:40,550
~ Do you doubt me?
~ But our barrier is Mom.

208
0:26:41,179 --> 0:26:46,020
I meant struggling against nature, not against your mom.

209
0:26:46,242 --> 0:26:51,558
~ To have the joy of victory.
~ So I'm sure you'll have fun!

210
0:26:51,685 --> 0:26:57,245
Overcoming mom, that's tougher than a 8000 meter climb.

211
0:26:58,768 --> 0:27:2,630
~ Where are you going with that jalopy?
~ To the dispensary.

212
0:27:2,751 --> 0:27:5,889
So that it doesn't break up at the show.

213
0:27:5,912 --> 0:27:12,855
~ It's time for the veterans' parade again?
~ Yeah! And Mána must win!

214
0:27:13,076 --> 0:27:21,331
~ It'll be enough if it charms like last year.
~ What did it win last year?
~ The prize! ~ What?

215
0:27:22,262 --> 0:27:23,900
The very last place!

216
0:27:26,624 --> 0:27:30,442
~ Watch out here, it's bumpy!
~ Don't worry!

217
0:27:35,429 --> 0:27:40,265
~ Why is the rock called the Dragon's Tooth?
~ To scare us.

218
0:27:40,492 --> 0:27:47,304
I'm not scared of the Tooth, but you are scared. Of Mom. Otherwise we would have climbed it.

219
0:27:47,335 --> 0:27:52,675
Do you know what you're asking from me? Do you not feel bad?

220
0:27:53,899 --> 0:27:59,996
Do you know how bad I felt while I had no father like other boys?

221
0:28:7,367 --> 0:28:13,860
~ I have an idea!
~ I know! We'll give mom the silent treatment until she gives in!
~ No!

222
0:28:13,990 --> 0:28:21,184
~ I'll try to get her to lift the ban.
~ Will you do it?

223
0:28:22,415 --> 0:28:28,354
I'll do what I can! But you must leave us alone!

224
0:28:28,458 --> 0:28:31,372
You can rely on me!

225
0:28:32,901 --> 0:28:37,419
Vasek! Vasek, Lubos!

226
0:28:40,465 --> 0:28:45,159
~ Where are the boys?
~ They went shopping!

227
0:28:45,568 --> 0:28:52,147
~ They're still not back yet?
~ They went back. They forgot bread and their backpack!

228
0:28:52,272 --> 0:28:54,548
I'd like to know what they've got on their minds!

229
0:28:54,673 --> 0:28:59,468
If they took a shortcut, we'll be waiting for them with the dinner.

230
0:29:11,162 --> 0:29:17,343
The shortcut will take about three hours. This is a really crazy place.

231
0:29:17,766 --> 0:29:24,818
~ Where are the potatoes? They were here.
~ You mean the week old, mouldy potatoes?

232
0:29:25,150 --> 0:29:31,047
~ I threw them away.
~ There goes our snack, Pepa!

233
0:29:43,140 --> 0:29:46,817
~ What's this?
~ This is Pepa.

234
0:29:47,422 --> 0:29:52,977
~ I scrubbed the entire house.
~ Vasek likes wild boars.

235
0:29:53,105 --> 0:29:58,182
I went around three communal farms to get him.

236
0:29:58,308 --> 0:30:3,908
~ A black pig is rare these days.
~ Mom, can you see it!?

237
0:30:4,071 --> 0:30:10,986
As if three men weren't enough; I have to care for a pig, too. What a Bermuda trip!

238
0:30:11,015 --> 0:30:16,650
Look Pepa, it looks like the poor boy's had no life with that woman.

239
0:30:17,079 --> 0:30:23,954
You'll certainly not have a clue what he longs for!

240
0:30:24,082 --> 0:30:30,119
I know! He'd like a chimpanzee to swing on the chandelier in the bedroom.

241
0:30:30,246 --> 0:30:35,006
I wanted to keep whales when I was his age.

242
0:30:35,129 --> 0:30:40,322
That hardly surprises me. What he didn't inherit from his father, he inherited from you.

243
0:30:41,352 --> 0:30:44,551
And the floor will be scrubbed by one of you. And I guess Pepa won't do it.

244
0:30:45,975 --> 0:30:52,292
That you're a single mother, I don't mind.

245
0:30:52,418 --> 0:30:57,972
Who you got the baby with, I'm not interested. I'll quietly play grandfather.

246
0:30:58,201 --> 0:31:2,143
But in this cottage, what the man says matters! And that man is me.

247
0:31:5,586 --> 0:31:8,178
Anna! Anna!

248
0:31:8,347 --> 0:31:12,103
Anna! Annie! Honey! I have an idea!

249
0:31:12,750 --> 0:31:19,386
~ Where did you come by that?
~ You see that pine! Meet me there in ten minutes.

250
0:31:19,513 --> 0:31:25,467
~ Am I playing hide and seek with you all?
~ No, just me.

251
0:31:25,597 --> 0:31:30,434
Vasek's in the woods with grandpa getting beechnuts! Do you understand?

252
0:31:30,559 --> 0:31:35,936
~ No!
~ I disappeared from them.
~ Are you asking me on a date?

253
0:31:36,663 --> 0:31:43,242
Honey, don't be surprised. I'm a world record beater at 2 kilometers' run.

254
0:31:43,967 --> 0:31:51,601
~ But I have muffins on the stove.
~ What are you thinking about!

255
0:31:51,771 --> 0:31:54,927
That you need something to eat!

256
0:31:55,153 --> 0:31:57,429
No, not here!

257
0:32:1,457 --> 0:32:8,313
~ Mom, help! Mom!
~ This isn't Colombo, it's Juantorena.

258
0:32:8,641 --> 0:32:12,302
Not this way! It'll track in dirt from the barn.

259
0:32:12,423 --> 0:32:17,263
~ What did you promise me?!
~ I didn't know you were persuading Mom.

260
0:32:17,385 --> 0:32:22,303
~ What were you thinking?
~ That you were lost in the woods.

261
0:32:24,790 --> 0:32:32,474
~ Grandpa, can we make Pepa wild?
~ The pig? And why?
~ So that he's wild again.

262
0:32:33,294 --> 0:32:36,648
That would take a lot of work! The whole holiday.

263
0:32:36,776 --> 0:32:43,889
~ If you didn't go to work, could you do it?
~ No! Grandpa has a plan to fulfill.

264
0:32:43,920 --> 0:32:47,358
Pepa's happy he's tame, in the barn.

265
0:32:47,482 --> 0:32:52,955
~ Where are the ants coming from all the time?
~ Grandpa, where do you actually work?

266
0:32:53,085 --> 0:32:55,726
I have three working tools:

267
0:32:55,947 --> 0:33:3,566
a trained body, an obsession to achieve everything in the world, and strong nerves.

268
0:33:3,991 --> 0:33:8,953
~ I can see that!
~ You're a climber?

269
0:33:9,554 --> 0:33:14,746
All the climbers look at me from below! I'm a roofer.

270
0:33:15,278 --> 0:33:18,415
So the rope in the loft's yours?

271
0:33:18,539 --> 0:33:26,734
Come here, Detective, and tell me why is Lubos still running after your mom?

272
0:33:27,364 --> 0:33:29,221
Dad's persuading Mom.

273
0:33:29,345 --> 0:33:34,780
Tonight it'll surely work out. But you'd better come downstairs, we'll go to the pond.

274
0:33:34,808 --> 0:33:41,604
~ I have to wait until Vasek falls asleep.
~ He'll drop off soon, he's pretty tired.

275
0:33:42,032 --> 0:33:46,028
~ Where did you get the sugar?
~ In the shop.

276
0:33:46,155 --> 0:33:52,306
They must be storing goods in an anthill. Maybe next time I'll go there with you.

277
0:33:52,398 --> 0:33:57,733
~ Shut your mouth and come to bed quickly.
~ Not to bed!

278
0:33:57,861 --> 0:34:4,443
~ Can't you hear me? Not another word, let's go!
~ Mom!

279
0:34:8,647 --> 0:34:16,127
When Anna discovers that you climb on the rocks with the kid, she's not staying here an hour.

280
0:34:16,452 --> 0:34:21,372
~ That would make you sad, wouldn't it?
~ No, but what if she takes the kid with her?

281
0:34:21,494 --> 0:34:25,125
We may not ever see him again.

282
0:34:25,256 --> 0:34:30,697
If that's what bothers you, you can just go to bed quickly.

283
0:34:48,629 --> 0:34:51,589
Lubos!

284
0:34:53,952 --> 0:34:56,751
Lubos!

285
0:35:7,860 --> 0:35:15,953
~ Lubos, what did Anna mean by the whale?
~ With what whale?

286
0:35:15,985 --> 0:35:20,261
I always thought I brought up a real man.

287
0:35:20,287 --> 0:35:25,441
~ That if you'd known Anna was expecting your baby, you'd have married her.
~ Of course I would!

288
0:35:25,870 --> 0:35:31,306
That's what I like! Because with a guy who does not care about his child...

289
0:35:31,433 --> 0:35:35,864
~ ...I wouldn't even shake hands.
~ But I didn't know.

290
0:35:52,745 --> 0:35:54,623
I've had enough!

291
0:35:54,746 --> 0:36:1,579
~ I can spank your butt!
~ If you knew how scared I was today.

292
0:36:1,710 --> 0:36:6,263
That I would fall asleep sooner than Mom. But I resisted!

293
0:36:7,293 --> 0:36:12,529
Let me make this clear. At night you don't have to wait for me.

294
0:36:13,657 --> 0:36:19,930
~ I'm cleaning this.
~ What?
~ The sugar!

295
0:36:20,120 --> 0:36:23,637
~ Why?
~ I'm picking out the ants.

296
0:36:23,762 --> 0:36:31,801
~ What kind of idea is that?!
~ I was worried Mom would go shopping with us.

297
0:36:32,627 --> 0:36:38,649
Now that we've just started to... you know what... so that it's not right over.

298
0:36:39,671 --> 0:36:44,571
Oh, come on, silly! Leave the ants alone!

299
0:36:45,494 --> 0:36:50,916
And remember! A real man is fearless.

300
0:36:53,579 --> 0:37:0,455
Oh, so you've already persuaded Mom?

301
0:37:4,285 --> 0:37:7,641
I haven't succeeded yet.

302
0:37:8,347 --> 0:37:17,005
Don't be sad! I'm sure you'll persuade her. I believe in you.

303
0:37:23,575 --> 0:37:27,533
What if I left Anna here with Vasek the whole holidays?

304
0:37:27,558 --> 0:37:32,875
~ You're not taking them with you in August?
~ Anna doesn't want to hear about mountains at all.

305
0:37:33,001 --> 0:37:38,554
~ When I'm on duty, I won't have time for them anyway.
~ And what does Anna say?

306
0:37:38,584 --> 0:37:45,003
~ Nothing, she doesn't know about it, yet.
~ I'm not going to talk her into anything!

307
0:37:45,728 --> 0:37:51,400
You don't have to, especially when you sleep with Vasek for the night.

308
0:37:51,531 --> 0:37:56,050
Oh that's what's on your mind.

309
0:37:58,015 --> 0:38:5,238
~ And when's the wedding, huh?
~ We're still planning it!

310
0:38:5,439 --> 0:38:10,373
~ You're so old fashioned.
~ You two are very modern!

311
0:38:10,501 --> 0:38:17,821
~ You have an eight-year-old child and you're already planning a wedding.
~ We knew each other for ten days, then I left for the Himalayas.

312
0:38:17,946 --> 0:38:24,024
We only met up again this year. We ran into each other at the ski resort.

313
0:38:24,149 --> 0:38:29,841
~ Suddenly I have an eight-year-old boy.
~ Save this story for Vasek.

314
0:38:30,072 --> 0:38:32,910
I just want you to get the boy on paper.

315
0:38:33,034 --> 0:38:40,289
I'll happily adopt my own child. I'll happily get him on paper, I'll even get a stamp! If you sleep with the boy in the kitchen tonight!

316
0:38:40,718 --> 0:38:43,234
I will, after the wedding!

317
0:38:45,341 --> 0:38:49,756
I'll start believing in miracles. Did you see Cinderella here tonight?

318
0:38:49,883 --> 0:38:56,326
~ The Cinderella was me!
~ You picked the ants out of the sugar? Why?

319
0:38:56,447 --> 0:39:3,484
~ So you wouldn't go shopping with us.
~ Why shouldn't I go with you?

320
0:39:3,611 --> 0:39:8,371
~ Vasek thought...
~ No interpreting, I'll listen to the original.

321
0:39:8,694 --> 0:39:14,806
I thought that you could sleep during the day, too. You deserve a rest.

322
0:39:16,118 --> 0:39:22,211
~ We've got us a nice boy, don't you think?
~ Let's go shopping again today, OK, Dad?

323
0:39:22,241 --> 0:39:28,620
~ We can skip it.
~ What about milk? I want milk!

324
0:39:29,745 --> 0:39:34,825
Do you understand that? He's always disliked milk. Listen...

325
0:39:34,948 --> 0:39:40,027
~ are you giving fresh milk to Pepa?
~ No!

326
0:39:40,952 --> 0:39:45,147
~ Dad said that good...
~ Don't wave those hands in the air!

327
0:39:45,274 --> 0:39:48,725
...they must drink a pint of milk a day.

328
0:39:48,756 --> 0:39:54,192
How do you make the boy obey each word you say?

329
0:40:3,244 --> 0:40:7,000
You have a tremendous influence over him.

330
0:40:9,247 --> 0:40:12,522
"Climbers, climbers, climbers...

331
0:40:12,649 --> 0:40:17,089
"don't climb the rock that's very pointy"

332
0:40:17,512 --> 0:40:23,404
"you'll fall on the sand and you won't see your home village anymore"

333
0:40:23,535 --> 0:40:24,855
"doo-dlay-dah."

334
0:40:25,376 --> 0:40:30,136
I hope you remember your promise. No climbing on the rocks.

335
0:40:30,559 --> 0:40:35,875
~ On the rock!
~ No, on the rocks!
~ Today we're not going anywhere.

336
0:40:36,302 --> 0:40:43,382
~ We'll help mother peel potatoes.
~ No, not potatoes! I want milk!

337
0:40:43,506 --> 0:40:49,380
~ I'll drink a whole liter.
~ What if Vasek went shopping alone?

338
0:40:49,510 --> 0:40:53,710
Your father and I could manage, just the two of us.

339
0:40:54,933 --> 0:40:58,605
Anna, you're just great!

340
0:40:59,435 --> 0:41:4,577
If you like peeling potatoes, I might as well go alone.

341
0:41:5,198 --> 0:41:8,158
It won't work! I can't let the boy go alone!

342
0:41:11,162 --> 0:41:15,877
~ No shortcuts back home, we're taking the road.
~ Why not?

343
0:41:16,004 --> 0:41:21,526
Mom didn't lift the ban, so we get commended.

344
0:41:21,548 --> 0:41:28,387
I like praise, don't you? Hey, Mána!

345
0:41:29,852 --> 0:41:32,814
Out of the way! Look out!

346
0:41:33,034 --> 0:41:42,127
~ Does the motor still die frequently?
~ No, now it can't stop.

347
0:41:42,639 --> 0:41:47,697
~ What does Mana do when there's fire?
~ No one knows!

348
0:41:48,663 --> 0:41:54,680
~ Up until yesterday, we climbed the rocks.
~ I thought I could convince Mom easily.

349
0:41:54,906 --> 0:41:59,805
You have to try harder. Look at me, I'll never give up.

350
0:41:59,929 --> 0:42:3,280
Now come back before I get angry. Think about Mom!

351
0:42:5,712 --> 0:42:8,467
~ Why?
~ Why, why... pick the things up.

352
0:42:8,994 --> 0:42:14,549
As of yesterday, we were banned from the rock by the pond.

353
0:42:14,677 --> 0:42:21,439
~ But this morning we're banned from all rocks in the world!
~ My mom always prohibits something.

354
0:42:21,861 --> 0:42:28,341
She never let me look for a dad! Now she's glad to have you!

355
0:42:28,365 --> 0:42:33,686
She'll be happy to see that I'm as able as you.

356
0:42:33,808 --> 0:42:38,440
~ You know what I see? A sly fox!
~ Where?
~ Right in front of me!

357
0:43:48,929 --> 0:43:51,923
I'm taking more rope.

358
0:43:53,812 --> 0:43:58,206
Now, Vasek, remember what I said. Three solid points of contact!

359
0:43:58,335 --> 0:44:1,294
On your toes!

360
0:44:4,238 --> 0:44:7,893
Higher, higher. Careful now! Hands up!

361
0:44:11,902 --> 0:44:15,340
Now pick up the loop!

362
0:44:16,345 --> 0:44:21,341
Hold on with your left hand and with the right one loosen the knot.

363
0:44:22,008 --> 0:44:25,302
Good! Like that!

364
0:44:28,992 --> 0:44:35,104
It won't work at the bottom, go over the top. There's a pocket above you.

365
0:44:37,036 --> 0:44:40,508
You can grab it on the right now. That's right!

366
0:44:43,960 --> 0:44:49,073
Switch your hands! Now go around the corner.

367
0:44:53,245 --> 0:44:59,747
Come on! Good! Dude!

368
0:45:2,610 --> 0:45:7,764
Lubos, a double fracture! His ribs in a cast.

369
0:45:7,893 --> 0:45:13,930
~ Hovorka's in the hospital.
~ Where?
~ I don't know! CLIMBER MEETING AT RISK STOP ...

370
0:45:14,057 --> 0:45:20,738
~ COME ASAP, STOP
~ When?
~ I'm not gonna bring it all the way up to you.

371
0:45:23,622 --> 0:45:28,858
~ What happened, Dad?
~ Well, buddy, that's the punishment.

372
0:45:33,728 --> 0:45:39,401
You know what I wish? That I could have those eight years back.

373
0:45:39,431 --> 0:45:46,444
~ Vasek didn't have a very great childhood with me.
~ Finally a reasonable sentence. I'll tell you something, too...

374
0:45:46,575 --> 0:45:53,290
I always thought you were irresponsible! Now I know that you keep your word.

375
0:45:53,919 --> 0:45:59,839
I keep checking the rock by the pond every hour. I suspected you unfairly.

376
0:45:59,962 --> 0:46:4,315
~ I'm not saying a thing.
~ Explain how you got back all right...

377
0:46:4,645 --> 0:46:8,263
while Vasek and Grandpa were chasing a wild boar?

378
0:46:8,487 --> 0:46:12,977
Because the only wild boar is our grandpa!

379
0:46:13,109 --> 0:46:17,102
But when you go shopping, someone always comes back with torn pants!

380
0:46:17,232 --> 0:46:23,551
~ And you always come back so tired.
~ What's wrong with Vasek?

381
0:46:23,675 --> 0:46:28,335
~ Nothing! He fell asleep!
~ Nothing? You say it just like that?

382
0:46:28,758 --> 0:46:38,035
We've been waiting a long time for this moment. Are you sure you just want to talk?

383
0:46:38,263 --> 0:46:44,137
~ You wanted to say something to me.
~ Later! This is important!

384
0:46:44,167 --> 0:46:50,040
~ I see. That's why we only see each other at lunch and dinner.
~ And breakfast.

385
0:46:50,170 --> 0:46:56,613
I know. You must sacrifice yourself so much to do all the silly stuff with our boy.

386
0:46:57,034 --> 0:47:1,575
I don't have to sacrifice myself at all.

387
0:47:9,821 --> 0:47:13,721
Damnit! How do they do this in other families?

388
0:47:13,843 --> 0:47:18,556
They must have a special training or something.

389
0:47:19,386 --> 0:47:25,208
~ I guess they have a grandpa who keeps office hours.
~ What are you doing, Dad?

390
0:47:25,330 --> 0:47:31,806
I took a day off, kids! So that nothing happens here!

391
0:47:33,254 --> 0:47:39,207
It's actually better! Grandpa can go shopping with the kid.

392
0:47:39,337 --> 0:47:49,072
~ And we'll finally have time for ourselves.
~ Mommy! Mommy! I got bitten by a bee!

393
0:47:50,744 --> 0:47:59,507
Dad, what are you doing? Mom, is Dad trying to see how long he can stay under water?

394
0:47:59,929 --> 0:48:4,209
~ Leave your father alone and go on out!
~ Grandpa!

395
0:48:4,331 --> 0:48:8,703
Granddad, my dad invented a new game, we need a stopwatch!

396
0:48:11,555 --> 0:48:16,190
When I whistle, leaves begin to fall from the trees.

397
0:48:16,818 --> 0:48:21,691
That's nothing! When I whistle, branches begin to crack.

398
0:48:22,121 --> 0:48:27,757
That's nothing at all. When I whistle... slaps start coming.

399
0:48:27,884 --> 0:48:31,515
~ Well, you win!
~ Why not me?

400
0:48:31,646 --> 0:48:37,486
You could forget to come back and we'd stay hungry.

401
0:48:37,610 --> 0:48:42,926
~ Into the enemy camp we have to send...
~ The most reliable!

402
0:48:43,053 --> 0:48:50,008
~ Be careful not to get captured!
~ Grandpa, who are we fighting against?

403
0:48:50,137 --> 0:48:52,652
~ Who's the enemy?
~ Mom.

404
0:48:52,778 --> 0:49:0,057
~ So mom will be our enemy!
~ I'm against that!
~ I'm for!

405
0:49:0,803 --> 0:49:7,696
I was talking with Kos. You can get married in the village. I'll write the wedding speech myself.

406
0:49:7,826 --> 0:49:13,346
I'll casually mention Venda and the rocks.

407
0:49:13,570 --> 0:49:19,424
Anna will be thrilled to hear about the wedding speech, it's not necessary...

408
0:49:19,553 --> 0:49:21,812
to mention Venda and the rocks.

409
0:49:21,934 --> 0:49:26,869
Oh come on, it's a woman. In that moment she won't even know what she's agreeing to.

410
0:49:27,097 --> 0:49:32,733
~ And I'll take care about you staying away from rocks until wedding.
~ Why do you want all the paperwork?

411
0:49:32,834 --> 0:49:34,735
When we two were climbing, you didn't have any permission, either.

412
0:49:35,402 --> 0:49:40,479
And Mom was as furious when she found us on Dragon Tooth, too.

413
0:49:40,905 --> 0:49:46,683
But we two continued to climb. And I'll have to pack up soon.

414
0:49:46,808 --> 0:49:53,826
You're not staying even until the end of July? What does Anna say?

415
0:49:54,252 --> 0:49:59,569
~ Nothing!
~ She still doesn't know anything?
~ I don't want to ruin her last week.

416
0:49:59,695 --> 0:50:6,571
~ No way! You're not leaving until the wedding.
~ An international climbers' session is not a dovecot!

417
0:50:6,699 --> 0:50:9,189
Then the wedding will be before you leave.

418
0:51:18,179 --> 0:51:21,935
Vasek, what are you doing up a tree again?

419
0:51:22,921 --> 0:51:26,298
Come on, get down!

420
0:51:38,530 --> 0:51:45,909
~ Who's the gingerbread for?
~ You'll say you caught me? I have to take it.

421
0:51:46,134 --> 0:51:50,451
~ I didn't say you couldn't.
~ Not you! Dad and grandpa did!

422
0:51:50,877 --> 0:51:52,834
They said I couldn't get caught.

423
0:51:52,958 --> 0:51:57,591
We have a new fighting game, and it has strict rules.

424
0:51:57,721 --> 0:52:4,196
~ Take what you'll eat and leave the rest at home!
~ But they're hungry, too.

425
0:52:4,324 --> 0:52:9,526
~ Why isn't Daddy coming home to eat?
~ It's a secret! Listen!

426
0:52:10,048 --> 0:52:16,125
~ He wanted to come home, but he's afraid.
~ Afraid? Of what?

427
0:52:16,211 --> 0:52:20,172
That you wouldn't let him go out until after dinner.

428
0:52:35,021 --> 0:52:40,098
Dinner's in the oven. You can help yourself.

429
0:52:40,224 --> 0:52:43,662
~ And what is it?
~ Noodles with poppy seeds!
~ Wow!

430
0:52:44,547 --> 0:52:49,318
Have you told Anna you're leaving? It seems strange, somehow.

431
0:52:49,449 --> 0:52:55,868
~ You told Mom that I like you, didn't you?
~ You're good, both of you!

432
0:52:55,993 --> 0:52:59,494
You're giving me tasks, but I've got my worries.

433
0:53:0,316 --> 0:53:7,377
~ If you want, you can all sleep in the kitchen.
~ Since you're getting married!

434
0:54:23,122 --> 0:54:25,354
Vasek!

435
0:54:45,134 --> 0:54:49,811
~ What are you doing?
~ Having a party.

436
0:54:56,820 --> 0:55:3,980
~ Alone?
~ No, I have company. Pepa.

437
0:55:8,046 --> 0:55:13,106
Keep an eye out for Vasek. He took down those clothespins.

438
0:55:13,469 --> 0:55:18,288
Be quiet when you see Vasek, he can't see me.

439
0:55:18,512 --> 0:55:23,384
~ This is the law of optics, darling.
~ He has binoculars.

440
0:55:25,216 --> 0:55:32,754
~ I wonder who gave it to him?
~ Do you know where?
~ Around the chimney.

441
0:55:33,180 --> 0:55:38,453
These are silly jokes! We're finally alone and you're pouting.

442
0:55:38,984 --> 0:55:45,446
~ Go where you heart leads.
~ If it were up to me, I'd always be with you.

443
0:55:45,467 --> 0:55:51,342
~ I also have my duties.
~ Yes! Continuous working time.

444
0:55:52,371 --> 0:55:59,047
If you left grandpa with a boy in the woods, you'd come up with something, right?

445
0:55:59,075 --> 0:56:6,154
~ Oh no!
~ Yes! Besides, you played with them half the night.
~ Trying to get them sleepy.

446
0:56:6,579 --> 0:56:9,078
But you'd locked the door. I knocked to get in.

447
0:56:9,200 --> 0:56:17,362
~ At half past eleven!
~ You were waiting for me? If only I had known.

448
0:56:18,225 --> 0:56:21,263
If I had known.

449
0:56:21,407 --> 0:56:27,801
~ What are you doing with that towel?
~ I'm hot when you're angry at me.

450
0:56:27,931 --> 0:56:31,130
I'm still mad at you.

451
0:56:32,653 --> 0:56:37,111
What are you doing with that? Tell me!

452
0:56:37,936 --> 0:56:42,633
Not here! We have to sneak off somewhere.

453
0:56:42,859 --> 0:56:47,516
If you've had enough teasing, go pick someone else.

454
0:56:51,204 --> 0:56:56,600
~ Shall we go higher?
~ What if we get near your grandfather?

455
0:56:57,527 --> 0:57:0,783
~ Don't worry!
~ I don't like saltiness!

456
0:57:3,611 --> 0:57:8,287
~ Have courage.
~ Why are we watching grandpa there?

457
0:57:8,413 --> 0:57:14,893
~ I think he wants to play with us.
~ Why can't he go climbing with us?

458
0:57:14,917 --> 0:57:20,590
After climbing on the roofs throughout the year, he's looking for other entertainment.

459
0:57:21,320 --> 0:57:25,921
Damn! Everywhere there's just jam or compôte.

460
0:57:26,343 --> 0:57:29,574
The woman will be making more jam and stuff.

461
0:57:29,705 --> 0:57:34,020
I want to find a mug and I get a compass.

462
0:57:34,848 --> 0:57:39,721
You'd better take a compass into the woods and find a game for two.

463
0:57:39,851 --> 0:57:45,269
I'd be grateful if you'd take the boy and give Lubos a moment with me.

464
0:57:45,394 --> 0:57:50,751
~ I'm working on it.
~ What are you doing?

465
0:57:51,477 --> 0:57:56,173
~ Looking for a Halloween costume.
~ A Halloween costume.
~ Yeah!

466
0:57:56,680 --> 0:58:5,480
~ Here we go. What do you think?
~ Where did you get that horrible outfit?

467
0:58:5,605 --> 0:58:11,921
This is a family tradition. The last time, we scared Lubos.

468
0:58:12,049 --> 0:58:18,924
~ The boy will be thrilled, won't he?
~ I see it. I'm terribly frightened.

469
0:58:19,353 --> 0:58:24,368
~ And you say thrilled.
~ Women! They never understand.

470
0:58:24,395 --> 0:58:28,596
The boy will have a memory for life.

471
0:58:28,978 --> 0:58:34,119
"Close your eyes, Anna, you authorize the rope...

472
0:58:34,241 --> 0:58:38,194
"get out a bit to the right, below us is the design,...

473
0:58:38,323 --> 0:58:45,782
~ "Bump, this time it went well..."
~ Slack off! Give me some slack.

474
0:58:46,328 --> 0:58:52,788
~ I loosened the rope!
~ Can you see where it's stuck?

475
0:58:56,673 --> 0:59:0,506
I see! It jammed there at a crack.

476
0:59:0,636 --> 0:59:6,809
~ I'm going up there!
~ Don't move! Don't you dare! I'm coming right down.

477
0:59:20,206 --> 0:59:22,676
Daddy!

478
0:59:23,368 --> 0:59:25,485
Dad!

479
0:59:25,609 --> 0:59:28,079
Daddy!

480
0:59:28,251 --> 0:59:32,371
Hold on! I'll go for help!

481
0:59:32,533 --> 0:59:34,795
Help! Grandpa!

482
0:59:34,915 --> 0:59:38,432
~ Don't move, Vasek!
~ Help!

483
0:59:38,557 --> 0:59:41,818
~ Get back, Vasek!
~ Help!

484
0:59:42,659 --> 0:59:45,937
Help! Grandpa!

485
0:59:46,601 --> 0:59:52,153
Grandpa, help! Grandpa!

486
0:59:52,825 --> 0:59:57,218
~ Dad's hanging on a rock.
~ Which one?

487
0:59:57,347 --> 0:59:59,767
Dragon's Tooth!

488
1:0:0,489 --> 1:0:3,866
Mom, help! Water Goblin!

489
1:0:7,153 --> 1:0:10,146
~ What's wrong with dad?
~ Hanging.

490
1:0:10,274 --> 1:0:16,956
I told you, Grandpa! This child of yours got a shock.

491
1:1:3,344 --> 1:1:7,464
Fanda, look out! Out of the way!

492
1:1:9,107 --> 1:1:11,668
What is it?

493
1:1:18,492 --> 1:1:21,964
A water goblin, and he called me Fanda?

494
1:1:23,675 --> 1:1:28,968
That guy scared me. What are you doing?

495
1:1:29,098 --> 1:1:35,073
No problem, I still had a rock in my hand. Still, I wish the boy'd listened to me.

496
1:1:35,201 --> 1:1:40,278
Why would he listen? You disobey me, too!

497
1:1:40,404 --> 1:1:45,276
Don't worry! Your jokes are stupid!

498
1:1:45,407 --> 1:1:48,481
Damn! Our Mom!

499
1:1:48,609 --> 1:1:52,809
Anna, honey! Where did you come from?

500
1:1:54,092 --> 1:1:59,613
~ You are nice scammers!
~ I'm not! I'm just a sprite!

501
1:1:59,735 --> 1:2:5,847
~ This is where you go shopping?
~ No, we're on our way shopping!

502
1:2:6,379 --> 1:2:9,896
~ What are you doing here?
~ Here...

503
1:2:12,622 --> 1:2:20,054
~ This is on the way, Daddy.
~ Yeah! It's on the way. You know...

504
1:2:21,267 --> 1:2:28,029
What's this, clothesline? I forbade you to climb rocks. You promised!

505
1:2:28,151 --> 1:2:32,226
~ Don't shout!
~ What was that?

506
1:2:32,353 --> 1:2:35,791
I confess, I climbed up.

507
1:2:35,915 --> 1:2:43,731
I wanted to show off in front of the kid. I'm a conceited idiot!

508
1:2:44,460 --> 1:2:47,214
What about Vasek?

509
1:2:48,042 --> 1:2:51,696
Vasek? He was watching me.

510
1:2:52,524 --> 1:2:56,395
You expect me to believe that Vasek sat and just watched?

511
1:2:56,427 --> 1:2:59,926
You should trust me. He's my child!

512
1:3:0,049 --> 1:3:3,462
~ With me, nothing will happen to him!
~ Be reasonable!

513
1:3:3,510 --> 1:3:8,529
If the boy had been up there, too, he wouldn't have needed any help.

514
1:3:8,653 --> 1:3:12,787
I believe you, Grandpa! And when you kill yourself on the rock, I won't care.

515
1:3:19,820 --> 1:3:24,621
Don't be sad, Dad! Mom spoke the truth.

516
1:3:24,742 --> 1:3:31,641
~ Do you think she would shed a tear for me?
~ A whole stream. Absolutely!

517
1:3:40,051 --> 1:3:44,508
I wonder how Anna now shall flow with you to the altar?

518
1:3:45,334 --> 1:3:51,156
Have you told her that you're leaving in the middle of the summer?

519
1:3:53,678 --> 1:3:55,351
Lubos!

520
1:3:57,921 --> 1:4:0,678
Don't worry, I'll work it all out!

521
1:4:3,164 --> 1:4:7,239
Be careful, everyone. What do you see here?

522
1:4:7,666 --> 1:4:13,126
~ This is a general plan of attack.
~ What are we attacking?

523
1:4:14,050 --> 1:4:17,430
Leave the cakes alone, or there won't be any for dinner.

524
1:4:17,452 --> 1:4:21,284
Do you think I'm going to eat what they cook?

525
1:4:21,514 --> 1:4:26,329
~ Grandpa, listen to what the chief says.
~ Grandpa is to go north.

526
1:4:26,356 --> 1:4:31,387
Around the Stone Snake cross to the Dancer.

527
1:4:32,620 --> 1:4:35,735
Your mother will go to the south, along the creek upstream.

528
1:4:35,962 --> 1:4:41,915
Vasek will follow the footsteps of grandfather and I'll track Mom.

529
1:4:44,847 --> 1:4:50,989
~ My dad has just the best games!
~ Around three, we'll meet here!

530
1:4:51,210 --> 1:4:55,585
And we then come back home together. In the evening we'll have scoring, prizes.

531
1:4:55,713 --> 1:4:58,784
For stamina and the like!

532
1:4:59,915 --> 1:5:2,556
What if mom gets lost?

533
1:5:2,677 --> 1:5:6,297
It'll be best if the three of us all track her.

534
1:5:6,419 --> 1:5:12,138
Colombo, you're going north! I can do it myself!

535
1:5:13,262 --> 1:5:17,656
Oh! I understand!

536
1:5:18,726 --> 1:5:24,486
~ What are you doing? Did you slice the cucumbers?
~ My muffins.

537
1:5:29,532 --> 1:5:35,167
Just you dude, you just don't give up! You're all mine!

538
1:5:36,515 --> 1:5:41,137
Don't tell me! I understand about your shopping and the ants.

539
1:5:41,258 --> 1:5:45,698
Vasek followed you on the rocks every day! He gave you away.

540
1:5:46,621 --> 1:5:52,335
~ So Vasek could watch.
~ Hardly a big sacrifice.

541
1:5:52,464 --> 1:5:56,640
After all, you climbed on the rocks for your pleasure, in this heat?

542
1:5:56,767 --> 1:6:4,200
I feel guilty about what I did, but also for what I didn't do.

543
1:6:4,331 --> 1:6:8,008
I can never give back to Vasek what I owe him!

544
1:6:8,233 --> 1:6:10,567
Eight years of life.

545
1:6:14,396 --> 1:6:20,919
In August, I'd go anywhere with you. Even on a bicycle to Krkonos Mountain.

546
1:6:21,040 --> 1:6:26,558
~ I'd rather stay here with Grandpa.
~ The wedding could be here on Tuesday!

547
1:6:26,683 --> 1:6:30,314
It doesn't matter where the wedding is.

548
1:6:30,846 --> 1:6:36,128
It matters! Grandpa and the kid should be happy!

549
1:6:36,549 --> 1:6:40,866
Today's Sunday, I'll write a letter to my mother on Monday. I'll have it off by noon.

550
1:6:40,991 --> 1:6:46,045
~ Friday, and the wedding can be on Saturday.
~ Not sooner?

551
1:6:46,174 --> 1:6:57,198
~ Why?
~ There's something you don't know. I'll explain all this!

552
1:6:57,520 --> 1:7:0,116
Don't say anything now!

553
1:7:23,555 --> 1:7:29,076
Grandpa, this is no game! Dad shouldn't give Mom any hints at all.

554
1:7:29,198 --> 1:7:32,312
None, but he's carrying her.

555
1:7:32,440 --> 1:7:35,034
So let them! In the evening we'll deduct points.

556
1:7:35,061 --> 1:7:42,041
You broke the route. You should be at the crossroads, not the cemetery.

557
1:7:42,065 --> 1:7:53,200
Don't grumble, here's where grandma rests. Too bad she didn't live with luck.

558
1:7:53,812 --> 1:7:55,849
What luck?

559
1:7:55,973 --> 1:8:2,049
You have some luck, Grandpa? Hiding? Right?

560
1:8:7,939 --> 1:8:16,600
~ Grandpa! Grandpa!
~ You see, I'm happy! The boy's pulling such a stunt.

561
1:8:17,545 --> 1:8:20,983
He probably is really ours!

562
1:8:24,749 --> 1:8:27,982
Now I don't know what to think.

563
1:8:30,952 --> 1:8:37,255
~ Repeat, Colombo went to the North.
~ Colombo went to the North.

564
1:8:43,039 --> 1:8:46,238
Somebody's breathing here.

565
1:8:46,461 --> 1:8:57,660
~ Don't turn around! This isn't Colombo.
~ It's Pepa.
~ It's not Pepa.

566
1:8:58,307 --> 1:9:1,324
It's a wild boar!

567
1:9:7,973 --> 1:9:10,966
Too bad it's not Venda.

568
1:9:15,757 --> 1:9:20,649
~ Mom, we'll be walking to the wedding?
~ So what? You'd rather we had to ride a bike?

569
1:9:20,880 --> 1:9:28,403
~ That's not a bad idea!
~ I'll do even better! I'll get you a great ride!

570
1:9:28,624 --> 1:9:32,456
~ Grandpa, hell no!
~ For Mána it'll be a great honor.

571
1:9:32,586 --> 1:9:35,022
How's this? I've got a better idea!

572
1:9:36,549 --> 1:9:43,941
~ But I don't know just what kind yet.
~ I'm relieved.

573
1:9:44,073 --> 1:9:50,084
~ Lubos, save it for the wedding!
~ But this left us just a few steps away from the top!

574
1:9:50,216 --> 1:9:56,856
~ There! And my dad won't try?
~ Careful! Otherwise he'll carry you off to the pen with Pepa!

575
1:9:57,180 --> 1:9:59,776
And I warn you one last time!

576
1:10:7,026 --> 1:10:13,182
Grandpa! Have you seen the guys?

577
1:10:13,509 --> 1:10:16,129
They went shopping in the morning but never even went to the store.

578
1:10:16,151 --> 1:10:20,372
~ I've got a letter for my mother.
~ How did you find your way to the village?

579
1:10:21,294 --> 1:10:27,054
~ The road. There were ants in the sugar again.
~ You know what?

580
1:10:27,177 --> 1:10:32,254
There's the mail box, the sugar, so go on home.

581
1:10:32,680 --> 1:10:35,259
~ What about the guys?
~ We'll handle this alone.

582
1:10:35,381 --> 1:10:38,455
Mána's crew wishes good health to the bride.

583
1:10:38,583 --> 1:10:44,024
~ I brought Voves.
~ Wolf, the head of the pigs' nursery.

584
1:10:44,146 --> 1:10:48,647
We're here to be witnesses. Kos, our president.

585
1:10:48,669 --> 1:10:54,448
~ Tomorrow I dress in black.
~ Why black?
~ There's a wedding, right?

586
1:10:54,472 --> 1:10:59,287
~ Tomorrow?
~ It's Tuesday, right?
~ Sure, it's Tuesday!

587
1:11:0,115 --> 1:11:3,929
~ You're having a wedding.
~ But the wedding will be on Saturday.

588
1:11:4,057 --> 1:11:7,558
~ On Saturday, no!
~ On Saturday, definitely not.
~ Why not?

589
1:11:7,579 --> 1:11:13,632
~ Lubos didn't tell you? The whole village knows.
~ What?

590
1:11:14,163 --> 1:11:18,681
~ He's leaving Wednesday.
~ Who?
~ Lubos, of course!

591
1:11:19,606 --> 1:11:22,246
~ The day after tomorrow?
~ Yeah, at noon.

592
1:11:22,367 --> 1:11:25,598
~ At noon he definitely's going away.
~ Where?

593
1:11:25,829 --> 1:11:31,545
~ Mountaineers are having an exercise.
~ In the Carpathians.

594
1:11:31,673 --> 1:11:36,649
He also said that there'll also be Poles, Germans, and Soviets.

595
1:11:37,076 --> 1:11:41,094
~ And Romanians.
~ Romanians, too, that's for sure!

596
1:11:41,818 --> 1:11:46,110
~ How long will he be there, did he say?
~ They say until the end of the holidays.

597
1:11:46,341 --> 1:11:50,892
~ He'll be back in September.
~ Leave it, she doesn't know what's going on!

598
1:11:51,524 --> 1:11:55,500
I guess I've spoken out of turn. Do you know about a mountaineering exercise?

599
1:11:55,626 --> 1:11:59,940
~ Grandpa!
~ He didn't tell you? I'll tear him to pieces!

600
1:12:3,951 --> 1:12:10,507
~ What happened here?
~ Nothing! Lubos is lost.
~ Who? ~ The groom.

601
1:12:11,094 --> 1:12:15,746
Anna, I'll fix it! Everything will be fine.

602
1:12:15,877 --> 1:12:20,396
Take the shortcut. The pub's to the right.

603
1:12:20,520 --> 1:12:22,876
Not the shortcut!

604
1:12:23,001 --> 1:12:25,961
Come on, crank it up!

605
1:13:0,142 --> 1:13:4,677
~ Congratulations! ~ We did it!
~ Now you really are the best! I'm so happy for you.

606
1:13:5,004 --> 1:13:11,117
~ At one point I almost cried.
~ But you did it!

607
1:13:11,248 --> 1:13:15,626
~ It feels like a fairy tale.
~ Why?

608
1:13:15,750 --> 1:13:18,310
Look at this beauty!

609
1:13:27,717 --> 1:13:34,671
~ No signs, just the sun... ~ Rock...
~ Dragon's Tooth... ~ And the two of us!

610
1:13:38,123 --> 1:13:44,657
~ Can you hear that, Dad, Mána!? Is there a fire?
~ Yeah! Directly below us.

611
1:13:45,367 --> 1:13:48,618
Mom, I'm here!

612
1:13:49,009 --> 1:13:52,889
~ I'm a climber like my dad.
~ Be quiet!

613
1:13:53,011 --> 1:13:56,085
Vasek! Vasek!

614
1:13:56,613 --> 1:13:59,234
I did it!!

615
1:13:59,455 --> 1:14:2,732
Guys, watch out, Mom!

616
1:14:5,738 --> 1:14:10,110
~ Grandpa, how will they get down?
~ Down the rope.

617
1:14:10,141 --> 1:14:15,376
~ The rope!
~ Don't look there!
~ Bring me the boy!

618
1:14:15,504 --> 1:14:21,137
~ Maybe the ladder.
~ The ladder. Deploy the ladder.

619
1:14:21,407 --> 1:14:25,221
No, Mom, not a ladder! We are climbers!

620
1:14:25,349 --> 1:14:30,551
~ It will be chancy!
~ The Conqueror of picturesque mountains on the ladder.

621
1:14:30,672 --> 1:14:37,195
~ It'll be our honor, Mána.
~ Providing a rescue for the chief.

622
1:14:37,316 --> 1:14:40,777
~ Chief...
~ Mountain Rescue Service..

623
1:14:40,898 --> 1:14:46,316
~ It doesn't work.
~ Why not?
~ It's stuck!

624
1:14:46,441 --> 1:14:53,521
~ Turn it again.
~ But the other way around.
~ What happened here? I do not know.

625
1:14:53,645 --> 1:14:59,883
So! Someone says something and you spread it around the village via express.

626
1:15:0,008 --> 1:15:5,802
~ We'll rescue the chief with the ladder.
~ Lubos? The two of you?

627
1:15:5,932 --> 1:15:13,570
~ He's hurt?
~ No! Why?
~ Otherwise, he'd climb down the rope like that boy over there.

628
1:15:13,696 --> 1:15:21,138
~ Vasek, wait!
~ Andrés, no! They deserve praise!

629
1:15:21,260 --> 1:15:25,380
Dad, watch out, it's Mom!

630
1:15:25,943 --> 1:15:29,996
Urchin, I'll spank you so hard you won't sit down for a week.

631
1:15:30,025 --> 1:15:33,622
Lubos, down!

632
1:15:34,507 --> 1:15:42,126
Now it will be exciting: if the storm gets even the chief.

633
1:15:42,452 --> 1:15:46,586
~ The Mom looks pretty well?
~ Yeah!

634
1:15:51,337 --> 1:15:55,078
Lubos, come on! You're losing your bride.

635
1:16:46,587 --> 1:16:48,564
Anna! Anna!

636
1:16:53,491 --> 1:16:56,053
Anna!

637
1:16:56,173 --> 1:16:58,371
Honey!

638
1:17:7,099 --> 1:17:12,592
I promised Vasek! Nothing will happen to him!

639
1:17:15,624 --> 1:17:18,238
I take it on my conscience!

640
1:17:23,428 --> 1:17:25,678
He's my son!

641
1:17:27,290 --> 1:17:32,367
Anna, forgive me! We'll never do it again.

642
1:17:32,493 --> 1:17:41,767
Don't do that! Vasek is looking forward to the fun, my dad's broken-hearted.

643
1:17:41,898 --> 1:17:44,815
I'll get a shock!

644
1:17:45,620 --> 1:17:49,853
I said I wouldn't go on a bike, but I went!

645
1:17:50,283 --> 1:17:54,058
I didn't want to stay here, but I stayed!

646
1:17:54,185 --> 1:17:58,417
I wanted to use and enjoy life at the stove!

647
1:17:58,547 --> 1:18:2,305
You fell in love with me, you can't live without me.

648
1:18:2,430 --> 1:18:7,570
~ So it doesn't matter whether the wedding's on Tuesday or Saturday.
~ Wedding? What wedding?

649
1:18:7,993 --> 1:18:10,189
The wedding will never be!

650
1:18:11,214 --> 1:18:16,292
You seemed to be a great dad. But you're a liar and a criminal.

651
1:18:18,218 --> 1:18:21,292
Like any normal guy!

652
1:18:30,865 --> 1:18:34,304
There you are! Not a letter, not a card, nothing!

653
1:18:34,728 --> 1:18:38,168
~ And here I am, covered in thorns, and you don't even care!
~ Don't get upset!

654
1:18:39,090 --> 1:18:43,005
No, there was no point in coming --- the wedding's off.

655
1:18:44,333 --> 1:18:49,586
Why off? The rascal won't marry you?

656
1:18:49,916 --> 1:18:52,273
I don't want to!

657
1:18:52,617 --> 1:18:54,934
Surely you can't do this to Vasek.

658
1:18:55,059 --> 1:19:0,758
This all means his mom hasn't decided to get married yet?

659
1:19:1,582 --> 1:19:6,103
I've decided! I don't care what Vasek will say!!

660
1:19:6,425 --> 1:19:13,601
But I want him to stay alive! No one may threaten the life of my children.

661
1:19:14,229 --> 1:19:21,648
What children? You specifically told him what you wanted!

662
1:19:21,774 --> 1:19:31,377
~ But he ignored it. Instead he took him up the Dragon's Tooth!
~ Above all, you love him.

663
1:19:32,099 --> 1:19:38,839
I don't want to see him anymore. He let me down!

664
1:19:39,383 --> 1:19:45,826
~ When I saw them climbing rocks.
~ You don't get it, girl!

665
1:19:46,047 --> 1:19:48,747
When a man is not a man, he's boring.

666
1:19:48,969 --> 1:19:54,524
Drivers or skydivers risk their lives every day.

667
1:19:55,052 --> 1:20:2,175
~ In contrast, climbing is a safe sport.
~ For bad men!

668
1:20:2,296 --> 1:20:7,137
~ They absolutely don't appreciate life.
~ It's not risky with Lubos.

669
1:20:7,259 --> 1:20:14,853
There's only one dangerous profession. Being a male! The boy needs to learn how!

670
1:20:14,883 --> 1:20:21,044
~ So embrace him!
~ How? Along with broken ribs?

671
1:20:21,167 --> 1:20:25,807
He's never coming back at all? He'll never accept that.

672
1:20:42,058 --> 1:20:49,291
~ Wow, Dad and Grandpa!
~ Three, two, one, zero, hop!

673
1:20:51,363 --> 1:20:55,996
~ So how did I do? Great?
~ You're the wisest.

674
1:20:56,126 --> 1:21:0,565
Prague has fifty schools and you find the right one!

675
1:21:0,989 --> 1:21:4,650
Grandpa couldn't even find his way out of the station.

676
1:21:4,771 --> 1:21:6,124
Don't trust him, Vasek!

677
1:21:6,152 --> 1:21:12,844
~ But now we have to correct the mistake.
~ How's life at home?

678
1:21:13,175 --> 1:21:18,132
~ I'm in hell! What about Pepa?
~ Forget Pepa. What about Mom?

679
1:21:18,258 --> 1:21:21,889
~ Still angry?
~ More and more!

680
1:21:22,020 --> 1:21:26,255
~ Does she talk with you?
~ Less and less!
~ Bloody hell!

681
1:21:26,383 --> 1:21:32,018
In the morning, she gets up, goes to the bathroom and closes the door, and's in there for an hour!

682
1:21:32,446 --> 1:21:37,918
~ What's she doing for an hour?
~ Sitting in the bath and sighing!

683
1:21:38,349 --> 1:21:46,004
Then she comes out, looks at a calendar and says: "Oh yeah".

684
1:21:46,034 --> 1:21:47,988
Maybe waiting for when you arrive.

685
1:21:48,115 --> 1:21:53,637
In the evening it's even worse. We had three bad fish.

686
1:21:53,858 --> 1:21:56,450
~ Why?
~ Because I don't like fish!

687
1:21:56,580 --> 1:22:2,002
It's women's tactics! I can't let things go on like this.

688
1:22:2,123 --> 1:22:7,100
You said that the storm would clear. But I see you've cleared up nothing.

689
1:22:7,326 --> 1:22:13,185
Vasek, take care of Grandpa! And don't come home in less than two hours!

690
1:22:15,310 --> 1:22:19,305
But, Grandpa, my dad doesn't have the key.

691
1:22:40,864 --> 1:22:44,085
A one and a two. Arabesque.

692
1:22:44,566 --> 1:22:47,701
A one and a two and brace those shoulders.

693
1:22:47,828 --> 1:22:49,581
Anna!

694
1:22:50,209 --> 1:22:53,561
Anna! Anna!

695
1:22:55,532 --> 1:22:57,792
I've arrived!

696
1:23:0,495 --> 1:23:4,251
Private business after the exercise!

697
1:23:4,677 --> 1:23:6,957
I wanted to tell you...

698
1:23:7,459 --> 1:23:10,618
I'll never do anything behind your back.

699
1:23:10,741 --> 1:23:13,112
Vasek and I will always climb rocks right in front of you!

700
1:23:17,244 --> 1:23:18,519
Turn!

701
1:23:26,029 --> 1:23:32,623
Mom, I'm sorry! I forced him to, every day!

702
1:23:33,053 --> 1:23:36,384
Dad didn't want to climb rocks! Not really!

703
1:23:37,616 --> 1:23:42,888
If only you knew how sorry Dad is! Really!

704
1:23:43,019 --> 1:23:46,380
~ Don't start that again!
~ It's all my fault!

705
1:23:46,501 --> 1:23:51,478
Look! When you listen to a kid, you get it across the ass.

706
1:23:51,904 --> 1:23:56,180
Since you won't listen to grownups, you can't do anything.

707
1:23:56,206 --> 1:24:1,598
~ And it doesn't help your Dad or anybody else.
~ Forgive us, Mom!

708
1:24:2,229 --> 1:24:7,765
I can forgive all the dirty tricks, but this is something else.

709
1:24:8,393 --> 1:24:15,536
~ I don't understand you.
~ Maybe you don't want us to be happy again?

710
1:24:16,157 --> 1:24:21,710
We once were three, but it can never be two again!

711
1:24:21,840 --> 1:24:27,181
Mom, Dad is here! With seven climbers. You call him!

712
1:24:27,303 --> 1:24:35,062
He's here! He wants to come home! Call him! Mommy!

713
1:24:57,640 --> 1:25:1,017
You want to go to your dad?

714
1:25:1,142 --> 1:25:6,583
~ Yeah.
~ Why don't you go? You'll have a lot of fun with him.

715
1:25:6,705 --> 1:25:11,203
It would be sad for you. I know that!

716
1:25:11,328 --> 1:25:15,865
I was sad, too, when I went there myself!

717
1:25:18,672 --> 1:25:26,194
You're my little scruff. I'll tell you a secret. Do you want me to?

718
1:25:27,517 --> 1:25:31,996
What would you say if a stork flew in for us in March?

719
1:25:32,419 --> 1:25:37,275
I don't want a stork! I want my own Dad to come home.

720
1:25:37,402 --> 1:25:42,164
~ Home! Now, now!
~ I'm going to have a baby.

721
1:25:42,285 --> 1:25:47,179
~ The two of us?
~ The three of us!

722
1:25:52,551 --> 1:25:56,288
Here, Colombo. I arranged everything. Absolutely!

723
1:25:56,413 --> 1:26:5,336
Tomorrow at exactly nine! Three rings! Password: kangaroo will arrive in March.

724
1:26:8,259 --> 1:26:15,853
~ What's this?
~ Nothing! Vasek wants to go to the zoo.

725
1:26:21,547 --> 1:26:27,483
~ Password?
~ Where's Mommy?
~ She went shopping!

726
1:26:27,690 --> 1:26:30,246
Don't leave! You're here!

727
1:26:30,372 --> 1:26:38,168
~ Password? Password?
~ Kangaroo will arrive in April.
~ In March!

728
1:26:38,496 --> 1:26:43,513
~ What's with a kangaroo, what is all this?
~ Kangaroos carry kids, too.

729
1:26:43,739 --> 1:26:49,561
~ Oh, you want a brother.
~ I don't want a sister!

730
1:26:49,682 --> 1:26:57,606
~ First they have to get married.
~ Grandpa, do you know how babies are born?

731
1:26:57,927 --> 1:27:3,887
~ After the wedding!
~ I kind of thought that myself.

732
1:27:4,210 --> 1:27:6,685
But it's enough if two people love each other.

733
1:27:6,812 --> 1:27:12,485
~ That's why your mother and I have you?
~ Yeah, I followed you.

734
1:27:12,515 --> 1:27:16,866
If we're not careful, you could have a little brother!

735
1:27:16,997 --> 1:27:22,057
She's not even married but she'll have two kids!

736
1:27:22,180 --> 1:27:28,839
~ You're not making sense!
~ My mom's telling the truth.
~ You're lying!

737
1:27:29,665 --> 1:27:35,144
Grandpa, how about we put our boy under the pump in a blanket?

738
1:27:35,268 --> 1:27:38,785
~ Why?
~ Let's see if he's tough!

739
1:27:40,010 --> 1:27:44,468
And when there's four of us, we'll take him rock-climbing!

740
1:27:45,493 --> 1:27:52,315
You're so confused. It won't be a boy, but a girl!

741
1:27:53,098 --> 1:28:0,196
Honey, don't you want me to say that we'll have two children wearing a kangaroo?

742
1:28:3,944 --> 1:28:8,019
How could the two of us have a girl?

743
1:28:8,226 --> 1:28:14,524
That together we'll have a second child, we really will.

744
1:28:14,549 --> 1:28:17,702
~ Right?
~ Oh, yes!

745
1:28:19,032 --> 1:28:22,504
Anna!

746
1:28:28,017 --> 1:28:31,534
Mom, Dad!

747
1:28:31,659 --> 1:28:35,051
What's wrong with you?

748
1:28:35,841 --> 1:28:42,542
~ You know what? I might send them to the zoo.
~ I know you, you'll go with them.

749
1:28:43,425 --> 1:28:46,817
Anna!

750
1:28:47,027 --> 1:28:51,069
Dad, Mom!
