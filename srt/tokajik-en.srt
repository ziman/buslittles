1
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:23,759
On Sunday morning, 19 November 1944, ...

2
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
the Germans rounded us up here,

3
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,320
to do forced labour, they said.

4
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,240
Each of us took a bit of food with us to work, as usual.

5
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:54,838
We did not suspect anything.
We'd been helping the resistance quite often.

6
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,600
We walked with the belief we were going to work.

7
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Until we got here, where everything became clear and inevitable.

8
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,200
They surrounded us

9
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
they set up machine guns behind us

10
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,660
and they read the verdict to us:

11
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,000
"For help and support of the resistance, ...

12
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,440
the government sentences you to death.

13
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,660
Women and children shall be expelled from the village

14
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,480
and the entire Tokajík shall be burned down."

15
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,240
And those words did come true.

16
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,160
Machine guns were back here,

17
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,600
we were placed around here,

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,480
And the firing squad was

19
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,760
about 5 metres towards the forest.

20
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,880
Once the verdict was read, shooting began.

21
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,560
Some men fell down, some tried to flee.

22
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,600
I was among those on the ground.

23
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and there was silence

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,120
then shooting resumed,

25
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,120
after the shooting, silence again.

26
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,560
Suddenly, after the second shooting,

27
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,360
there was yet another shooting

28
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,360
the Germans checked everyone up

29
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Whoever was still moving was shot in the head.

30
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,080
A German walked up to me, kicked me in the left side,

31
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
stepped on my back and said "kaputt".

32
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,040
Then I stayed quietly and didn't move

33
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,760
and when I did not hear the Germans anymore

34
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,640
I tried to turn my head a bit

35
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,080
to see what was going on around.

36
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,640
I saw the Germans leaving the site

37
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,120
As I felt bad around the heart

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
I tried to crawl to the brook.

39
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,680
But when I looked from the brook towards the lying men

40
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,880
I saw someone move.

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,400
I wasn't sure who was moving, as there was a dead body

42
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,320
on top of Medzvedz

43
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,880
his cousin, so they were both moving.

44
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,840
I gestured to him to keep lying down

45
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
that the Germans were nearby

46
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,560
they'll see us and catch us.

47
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,960
His son was behind the brook under a tree

48
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,960
curled up in pain.

49
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,400
When I showed him his son

50
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,520
he fell on his son

51
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,040
and I was worried that he'd die himself, from grief.

52
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,480
After a while, we tried to pull those men out of the brook

53
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,720
and group them by family.

54
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,920
The Germans saw us from the village outpost

55
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,240
And started to shoot at us with the machine gun.

56
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,440
So those of us left alive tried to flee.

57
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,920
We discussed returning back two days later

58
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,240
where I took a warmer coat from my brother as it was cold

59
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
And Michal Medzvedz took food from his brother

60
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
to have something to eat

61
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,080
so we could prolong our lives

62
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,440
even though we did not expect to survive.

63
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Michal Medzvedz treated my wounds

64
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,120
he placed various plants on them

65
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,920
he bandaged them with my torn shirt

66
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,640
the best he could.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,920
On the eleventh day, at night, we heard loud shooting.

68
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
We thought the Germans were cleaning up the forests.

69
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,560
We hid in a hollow tree

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
and we spent the night there.

71
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,360
In the morning, Michal Medzvedz found out

72
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,360
that it was the Russians so he let them know

73
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,280
to come and take me to the hospital.

74
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,280
32 victims

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,000
from our village

76
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,480
were transported back to the village after some time.

77
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,200
Tokajík was a little forgotten village back then

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,840
with 34 houses

79
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,200
made mostly of wood and straw.

80
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,440
Out of 34 houses, only one remained
after the village was burned down

81
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
and the church.

82
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,640
Out of 34 men fallen by the bullets

83
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,840
you and Michal Medzvedz
got the chance to live again.

84
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
you, witnesses .

85
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,440
However, the whole Tokajík remains a reminder
of the inhuman horrors.

86
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,080
Far from the world,

87
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,440
yet still in Europe, alive.

88
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,440
It lives on between two memorials:

89
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,520
The memorial of the horrible tragedy on one side,

90
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,640
32 dead sharing a grave on the other side.

91
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,280
I'm working here, taking care of the flowers.

92
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,360
on this monument
of my fallen brothers and sons.

93
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,880
I work there for them.

94
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,600
(unintelligible) they're together there and here.

95
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,760
I was a 20 years old
bricklayer's assistant.

96
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,120
I had already collaborated
with the local resistance.

97
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
Michal Medzvedz turned 43 two days before,

98
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,880
his son had turned 15 in August.

99
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,800
And he did not live to get any older.

100
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
The whole life of this Michal Medzvedz

101
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,800
resembles a spectre full of misfortune
brought on by the war.

102
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,360
Today, we can reconstruct his life story
based on his recounts.

103
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,200
He, Michal Medzvedz, is already tied to this memorial.

104
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,120
And this cemetery, too.
Actually, both cemeteries.

105
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,960
as the newer one belongs exclusively to his family.

106
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,920
It's too many paradoxes and a lot to unpack.

107
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's start with the new cemetery.

108
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,840
In six years, only four graves have been dug there.

109
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,800
Too many Tokajík residents died with no grave 25 years ago,

110
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,560
so Death has to be very patient here these days.

111
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,920
I tried to count all his relatives here, it was tough.

112
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Some of the graves are already gone,
even though they were quite recent.

113
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,320
Some are in this shared grave, with the memorial.

114
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,080
And the rest are in the new cemetery.

115
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,680
Instead of a total,
let's attempt a partial count.

116
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,640
Michal Medvedz had 8 children.

117
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,360
He was born into the wrong times;
none of his children remain alive.

118
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,480
He considers himself and his wife orphans,
quite rightly so.

119
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,240
The deadly consequences of war
did not bring only bullets and diseases.

120
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,080
They did not subside even after the war was over.

121
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,440
And so these places belong not only to his
parents, brothers, sisters

122
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,400
but mostly his three sons, five daughters,
and other relatives.

123
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,480
The tiny village has always been a big, branched family.

124
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,840
But let's take a break from talking
only about him and his closest ones.

125
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,920
There's 32 of them underneath this monument.

126
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,840
Ordered alphabetically, not by age.

127
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,840
They died in the name of the same monster.

128
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,600
Healthy young men and men in the war apocalypse

129
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,360
with the most natural desire to survive.

130
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,600
Two weeks ago, Michal Medvedz had to

131
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
to give two troughs' worth of apples
to the German officer

132
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
who would later read the death sentence.

133
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
He read it in the name of a government,

134
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,640
and gave the order to shoot.

135
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,280
And so there are only their names left as a memento

136
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,920
and here they are resting.

137
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
Father with son,

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,240
uncle with nephew from Veľký Orlík,

139
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,520
Johns, Josephs, Georges,

140
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,760
Michaels, Peters,

141
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,360
13 men of the Medzvedz family.

142
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,360
They must indict

143
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,520
The memento is cold and hard like marble.

144
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,640
Some innocent, in their home village,

145
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,040
some seeking a hideout from death
yet they perished right here.

146
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,040
The judgement can be passed only impersonally now

147
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,040
against war, against its perpetrators.

148
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,040
This is what's left after them:

149
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,920
as a proof that they wanted to,
and had the most human right

150
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
the right to live.

151
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,520
It would be best not to bring this up again.

152
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,800
if only violent death would also not come up again

153
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,600
The wounds have healed,
there are just memorials left

154
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,360
as a sad testimony of the past.

155
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,280
As I say, it would be best not to bring this up again.

156
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,160
If only that were possible,

157
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,600
if only now, after 25 years,
we could avoid thinking about it.

158
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,800
I survived.

159
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,400
but I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

160
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,320
Born in year 1901 for the first time

161
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,400
Born for the second time,

162
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,760
on 19 November 1944

163
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,680
when they shot at us

164
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
at my brothers and my sons

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I got a bullet under my right shoulder blade

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that's here, 2 centimetres from the lungs

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
here I got a bullet in the waist

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and they shot at the heads, too

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,160
God saved me, I did not get shot in the head

170
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,160
but my brothers did

171
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,840
they ended up dead but I remained alive

172
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,240
and I'm living until this day

173
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
and I work here at my brothers

174
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,320
and my sons, where they're resting now.

175
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,520
This  became the vocation of his spare life

176
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,520
how did it happen back then

177
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,520
he's frequently asked by visitors.

178
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,720
On 19 November 1944

179
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,880
the book tells you, you see

180
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,960
and Michal Medzvedz replies with the same words

181
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,320
he cannot and doesn't want to leave anything out

182
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,920
everything is important for knowing death and appreciating life

183
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,400
He's a living memorial,

184
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,960
the destiny could appoint no better guide here.

185
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,040
And so he takes care of the monument and the cemetery

186
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,880
every morning, given rain or sun.

187
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,760
It's his everyday work in retirement now.

188
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,560
His conviction remains unshakeable.

189
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,720
The war damages have not been paid up until today

190
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,040
noone will ever be able to pay for the human lives

191
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,320
And what happened in Tokajík
on 14 November 1944

192
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,120
I wouldn't want to live through again

193
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,520
I wouldn't want to ever experience war again.

194
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,960
Yes, there's no greater senselessness than war

195
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,360
and there's no greater loss than life.

196
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,160
We people have to know this

197
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
and to live with this knowledge.

198
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,240
Especially as the threat of other war Tokajíks

199
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,360
still exists.

200
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
Wars are not yet history.

201
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,200
Tokajík will remain on the war maps

202
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,560
inscribed in blood.

203
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,760
Noone would know about Tokajík
if not for the war.

204
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,720
There would be no memorials and no tourists.

205
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,640
Besides the memorials and the victims,

206
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,200
there remain 40 houses in Tokajík.

207
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,600
It's still a tiny village, with no decent road.

208
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,360
The first one to find the village was Death.

209
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,000
Tokajík lives on just like other small villages.

210
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,360
The fascists dragged it into the horrifying history

211
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,840
at the price of blood.

212
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,760
In one day, 19 November 1944,

213
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,600
in this tiny village, 32 dead men left behind

214
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,320
74 orphans and 20 widows.

215
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,720
Noone will ever erase this from history.

216
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,480
But today, this must deeply affect anyone

217
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,600
whatever their opinions.

218
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,280
Noone will ever erase Tokajík from history.

219
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,200
Will the youngest ones of Tokajík
need to be reminded in the future?

220
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,600
Let's ask them so we can hear their own words.

221
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Why is the memorial here, children?

222
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,200
And why are the graves here?

223
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm asking you, do you know?

224
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Who is in these graves?

225
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,840
Granddad.

226
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,920
Why is he here?

227
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,360
Because the Germans shot him.

228
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,880
When was that?

229
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,840
Which year?

230
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,440
1944.

231
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,880
Who's resting here?
Grandfather.

232
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,920
Whose grandfather?

233
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,280
Grandmother and grandfather.

234
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,040
You don't know?
No.

235
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
The Germans.

236
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Grandfather. They shot.

237
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,960
The Germans.

238
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,360
It was war. War.

239
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
And who shot those people?

240
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
(unintelligible) (Germans?)
