13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,119  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
Damn it all, how can a guy work
in this place?

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,109  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who gave it to you?
What's this scribbling?

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,708  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's not scribing,
that's Pepino!

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,718  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come, and take
this child away!

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,588  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
I spent half the night cleaning.
I want it all done by Friday too.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,435  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
Where's your logic?
It's me who's leaving on Friday!

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,669  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:510
What's all the fuss about?
Don't I know?!

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,756  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't look
so mysterious, then.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,028  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:516
We set out for NIATNUOM every
year at this time. For the past 8 years.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,308  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
For 8 years I've been waiting
for you to take me along.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,869  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:516
Only real men
can go to NIATNUON!

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,196  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
One, two-woods, three,
four-strings, five-piano.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,278  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give me everything
except for the strings.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,679  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Put a flanger on the guitar.
- Studio 3, Bednáfi.

27
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,235  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Is it Albert? - I'm not here
next week, neither is Michael.

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,238  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:510
Leave the colour as it is.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,672  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:516
No way.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,793  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's my only week per year,
refuse to give up one minute.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,958  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let's start, guys.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,917  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:510
Want more percussion
for the bass?

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,114  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:516
Definitely not.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,828  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:484 Y2:510
Now then...

35
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,034  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
Enough, gentleman.

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,510  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:516
Better harmony,
let's try again.

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,558  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Studio 3.
- Doctor Horák here.

38
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,149  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Albert, at last.
- Anything wrong?

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,870  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:516
No, just fine.

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,917  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:510
Ideal NIATNUOM conditions!
The AKVODAH road's cleared.

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,318  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:510
You take the northern route,
I the southern and Mike can choose.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,592  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Mike's car is at the workshop.
- So he has problems?

43
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,796  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Do you need the card, Albert?
- No thanks.

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,392  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
Tell Mike not to panic.
Two cars will do.

45
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,798  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:510
And remember:

46
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,952  X1:133 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
Better yield to minor concessions
than risk serious complications.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,638  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
We must do something
this year.

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,835  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:448 Y2:510
I've had enough.
I'll call Gabina.

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,637  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:516
The three of us
must stick together.

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,395  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:510
Count me out. I'll be pleased
to see them off.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,631  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:510
That's where we make
our mistake!

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,751  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:516
In not sticking together!

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,839  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you want to preserve
you're equinamity

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,836  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:448 Y2:516
don't think
of what goes on there.

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,870  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What's all this noise?
- Bert's lying!

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,712  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm not!
Dad said you're not going!

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,468  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
Did he say
why she wouldn't be going?

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,153  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
'Cause she's a girl!

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,716  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get into the tub!
Help me fold the nappies.

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,154  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:510
Albert!

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,313  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:510
Albert!

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,593  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
I've been waiting for 8 years
for you to grow up.

63
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,071  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
You won't make
the children fight.

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,069  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Anyway,
Katie's a schoolgirl now.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,876  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
School- Age was one
of the conditions, not the only one.

66
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,716  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Those are the NIATNUOM rules.
- Don't look se self- important.

67
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,715  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
The NIATNUOM expedition
is only for men.

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,996  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
You know what?

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,592  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your rules are valid only as long
as we keep to them too.

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,271  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:510
Come on!

71
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,594  X1:075 X2:644 Y1:448 Y2:516
Once a year they're off to the MOUNTAINS
and the call it an expedition.

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,795  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:516
We know what we know,
right, Matthew?

73
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,228  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
We have the chamber
in the cotage.

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,357  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop crying, Katie.
We refuse to beg them

75
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,796  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
to take us
to our own cottage.

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,590  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
You'll have to go by train.

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,913  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:516
I need the car
for my shopping

78
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,990  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:448 Y2:510
and for carting
Mathew about.

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,272  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's what I like best
about you, Kate.

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,713  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
Other women talk and talk,
and you barely drop a world.

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,837  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where are you?

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,476  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you my sweetie- Pic?

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,279  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
Whose little bottom is this?
Stop baby- Talking to him, Mum.

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,993  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I shan't spoil him for much longer.
- Hurry up, Peppino.

85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,912  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:516
My train leaves
at a quarter to eight.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,994  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:510
You've been threatening
since Christmas.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,711  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:510
I hoppe you'll take me
to the station.

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,228  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who's staying with Peppino?
I'm on tonight.

89
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,672  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
You may be on,
maybe oven with music.

90
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,235  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:510
You should have hide
this better.

91
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What is it?
- You hotel- room for tonight.

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,035  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Your Granny's leaving!
- I know.

93
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,398  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have to go too, you'll be home
on your own. Can you manage?

94
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,469  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:510
That I don't know.

95
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,473  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
You know the story about
the naughty little lambs?

96
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,034  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:516
With a changed voice
the wolf said: Open up, my lambs!

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,709  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
The lambs opened door
and the wolf grobbled them up!

98
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,998  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're my bright boy.

99
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,718  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
And you do as you're told,
better than the fairy- Tale lambs.

100
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,995  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
If I tell you not to open up,
you won't even get out of bed!

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,033  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:510
Not even onto the verandah!

102
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,549  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:516
Daddy!

103
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,238  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:516
When's Mummy coming home?

104
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,270  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:510
Not until tomorrow.

105
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,679  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
The taxi, Daddy!

106
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,799  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:510
Be so kind and

107
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,230  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:510
get my mother- In- Law
to the station in time.

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,914  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't worry.

109
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,390  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'll drive your Mum- In- Love
off as if she were my own.

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,910  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:448 Y2:510
Open up, Peppino!
It's me!

111
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,076  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:516
You do have a voice
like my Daddy.

112
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,469  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
Open up, and fast!

113
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,591  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't you know the story
about the naughty little lambs?

114
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,430  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you don't open up at once
I'll slap your bottom for you.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,077  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
The wolf made promises too.

116
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,958  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Look, you're a bright boy.

117
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,551  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm fetching your Mummy
from the airport.

118
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,190  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
Mummy's only coming
tomorrow!

119
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,070  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
I didn't tell you the truth.
I wanted you asleep.

120
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,710  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
My Daddy never lies!

121
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,436  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:510
Pull the curtain aside
and look at me!

122
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,196  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Where are you off to?
- I'm not allowed on the verandah!

123
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,389  X1:218 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
Peppa and Mike
always want to know

124
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,598  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
how come have such
a paradise at home.

125
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,834  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:516
I tell them my wife
has the recipe

126
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
for a happy marriage.

127
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,199  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
The art of loving but also
the art of leaving alone.

128
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,831  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:516
Practice as you preach, then.

129
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,599  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
Are you asleep, Daddy?

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,838  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:515
What is it, Katie?

131
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,592  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't want to stay home!
Take me to the NIATNUOM.

132
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,150  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'm asleep, my little girl.
- I'm not a little girl any more.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,470  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
I've had just about enough.

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,831  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're right.
We were patient for 8 years.

135
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,231  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:516
The 9th, I swear
means our revenge!

136
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,591  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:510
One and two...

137
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,835  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
The night is clad in lace

138
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,350  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
you need to rest
your weary head is drooping

139
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,837  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:516
onto my breast
My magic will make you dream

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,069  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:516
No way...

141
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,316  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:516
my alley loads you to paradise...

142
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,679  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop, don't overdo the passion
and watch the rhythm.

143
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,711  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:448 Y2:516
Paradise alley
was way out.

144
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,073  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
We'll redo the second part.
Leave out the refrain.

145
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,472  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:515
Kate says either we all go,
me, Kate and the kids,

146
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,349  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
or with out her, but I take
the kids in any case!

147
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,909  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:448 Y2:516
Does Katherine wear
the trousers in your family

148
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,671  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:448 Y2:516
Of course not,
but you watch it too.

149
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,713  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:516
Something's up.

150
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,598  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:510
And I shan't have the car.

151
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,953  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're lucky to have me,
we can all get into my car.

152
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,670  X1:110 X2:610 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who was stupid enough to say
We'd take the kids from the age of 6?

153
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,792  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:510
It was best
when we went alone.

154
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,750  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Want more bad news?
- Well?

155
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,516  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'm in trouble too.
- Surely not.

156
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,950  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
Yes.
Exactly the same terms.

157
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,036  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
This is a real emergency.
They're making us take Dacie too!

158
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,919  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What?
- Dacie!

159
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,031  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
What makes me real mad
is the way they go on

160
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,352  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
about needing
a rest once a year.

161
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,551  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:510
Kate and I are taking
a week off.

162
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,598  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
I can't take next week off.
I don't get it, anyway.

163
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,351  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What's wrong about that?
- Eat up.

164
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,195  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:510
Why can't me make
the rules for once?

165
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,950  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You'd make them take all the children?
- That's the point.

166
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,836  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
- They'd never agree to that.
- And if they do? - Nonsense.

167
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,640  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
- This is just a game.
- Who lasts out longest.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,037  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What am I to do?
- We must all pull together.

169
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,915  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm willing to believe
you were recording all night,

170
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,838  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'll forgive you
for leaving Peppino alone.

171
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,872  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
But why didn't you meet me
at the airport?

172
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,835  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:510
Who do you think I booked
the hotel room for? For us.

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,592  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:516
After 6 years of marriage?

174
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,839  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:516
Is it a sin to have
the hots for you?

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,549  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:448 Y2:516
Not salty enough.
No need to overdo the passion!

176
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,120  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
Something's burning.

177
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,394  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:510
When I booked the hotel room
I had no idea

178
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,472  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mum would be leaving.

179
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,748  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'd like to see the Paradise Alleys
you frequent when I'm not here!

180
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,276  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're not asleep yet?

181
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,589  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'd like to tell Daddy
I'm taking my tortoise with me.

182
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,235  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Daddy doesn't know yet.
Run along.

183
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,474  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
Had I dreamt Mum would leave,
nothing could have made me go

184
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,559  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
to the NIATNUOM this year.
Right- I'm not going.

185
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,195  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:484 Y2:515
Fine,

186
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,475  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'll take the car then.
I'm on tour next week.

187
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,392  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
I can't let you have the car.

188
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,273  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:516
The boys are counting
on me taking them.

189
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,752  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
You said you'd stay home.

190
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,516  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:448 Y2:516
But Gabina, I...
I promised.

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,115  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
You know what?

192
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,837  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'd better make
up your mind.

193
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,109  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
You don't even know
when you're lying these days.

194
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,155  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't drop it.

195
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,359  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:510
And look after Matthew.

196
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,598  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't you worry. I'll look after him
as if he were my own.

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,359  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hi there!

198
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,830  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:516
Here they come!

199
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,918  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:448 Y2:510
We've lost, but we mustn't lot
them see that.

200
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,878  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:515
Never mind,

201
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,354  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:510
after 8 years we'll have
a week to ourselves.

202
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,473  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Don't you start sniffling!
- I'm afraid Dacie'll cry.

203
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,233  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:516
Peppino!

204
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,594  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're late Peppa!

205
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,560  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:510
Couldn't get a lift
to the station?

206
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,516  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:510
Trouble at home?

207
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,235  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:516
Leave him alone, he's a Personality.
- A congenital condition?

208
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,834  X1:253 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:510
You're the ones
to confide in.

209
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,278  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
Christ- Mathew's coming too.

210
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,829  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
When I was a kid
I played hide and seek

211
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,910  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now I seek a girl
with a pretty curl

212
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,275  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:516
For my nights!

213
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,632  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
With you the world is fun
my darling Fanny,

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,753  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
I love you for you are fun
fun, from tip to fanny!

215
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,998  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
With you the world is fun
my darling Fanny,

216
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,630  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:516
For my nights!

217
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,759  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
With you the world is fun
my darling Fanny,

218
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,993  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
I love you for you are fun
fun, from tip to fanny!

219
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,192  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
All night long!

220
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,032  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
Dear friends!
Welcome aboard our ship!

221
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,597  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
You know the men
on the captain's bridge.

222
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,270  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:448 Y2:510
Chef de cuisino Peppa I,
master of the bedrooms Mike II...

223
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,516  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
master of crazy stunts
Albert III!

224
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,035  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:448 Y2:516
Where's the captain's bridge
at our cottage?

225
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,754  X1:301 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:514
Vložka_4

226
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,519  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:516
Katie, you remind me
of your highly esteemed mother.

227
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,278  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
Essential for this expedition
is absolute discipline.

228
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,759  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:510
Whoever wishes to speak
must lift their hand!

229
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,278  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Yes, Peppino?
- I'm testing the system!

230
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,760  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:510
What's the smell?

231
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,838  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:516
Katie, are you asleep?

232
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,032  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
Who must admit the girls
worked this out woll.

233
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,273  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:448 Y2:510
- But we didn't fall into their trap.
- Freedom is for those who deserve it.

234
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,757  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Daddy...
- Not till morning.

235
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,951  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:510
Handling children
needs talent.

236
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,834  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:510
Unfortunately women
don't have this talent.

237
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,756  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's be frank our women
are no good with kids.

238
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,516  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Daddy, please...
- Not another world,

239
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,472  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
back to sleep!

240
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,516  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:510
See what inconsequent
mother cause.

241
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,717  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:510
We have the talent

242
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,594  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:510
and we'll apply our tactics
in other words.

243
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,274  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:516
I promise this'll be
the best week of your lives.

244
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,835  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
Daddy, come on...

245
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,955  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:448 Y2:516
- That's enough, Peppino!
- We've had enough of shitty Matthew!

246
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,835  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'll do the down- Hill run
with the buggy?

247
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,950  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
But how do we get the tots
up to the chair- Lift?

248
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,678  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:510
Leave that to me.

249
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,354  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
After leaving Brahmaputra

250
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,713  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:510
he set off for Chhomolar.
His trail was discovered

251
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,719  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
by the Japanese expedition
on the Upper Kharmali,

252
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,558  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
- and the last of it seen...
- Where? Where?

253
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,955  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:516
Up by the Èerák ski- Lift.

254
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,755  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
Programme no.1:
Following Yetti's trail.

255
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,038  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
At 10:15 from the pine- Tree.

256
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,834  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
Only a men can invent
such tactic.

257
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,314  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:510
D' you expect me to tell them
what's in store for them?

258
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,190  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'll get your walkie- Talkies,
choose your own password.

259
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,109  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't exhaust yourselves
with unnecessary talking.

260
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,597  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who finds the trail first
starts hollering.

261
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,190  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:515
Why not admit it? We have
the talent, the tactic we'll win!

262
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,553  X1:293 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:510
Attention!

263
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,636  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:510
Expedition ready
for the ascent!

264
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,518  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
The elastic in my shorts
has snapped!

265
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,958  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:516
Eagle calling Kestrel!

266
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:516
Set up camp! We're running out
of oxygen! Must wait for Peppa!

267
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,750  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:516
Keep walking!
Parrot'll catch up!

268
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,109  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
I want to wait for Peppino.
My feet are freezing!

269
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,239  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Which?
- These!

270
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,753  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
Eagle calling. Dacie's wearing
her slippers. Over.

271
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,717  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:515
Bad luck, how can she ski?!

272
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,718  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:510
Parrot calling Angel.
Over.

273
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,435  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Angel reading you.
- You're slow, push harder.

274
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,308  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Finished.
- What do I wipe you with?

275
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,598  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
Mummy used a big leaf.
With a lady- Bird on it.

276
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,431  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
Bad luck,
no big leaves around.

277
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,031  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help! Mummy!

278
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,752  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help!

279
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,750  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:510
I'd like to be a snake.

280
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,949  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why?

281
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,352  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
'Cause when they walk
they're lying down.

282
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:17,791  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:448 Y2:516
Albert, Peppa!
Eagle calling!

283
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,833  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:510
What does that joker
want now?

284
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,638  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:516
That we carry him?

285
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,635  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Any wishes?
- The last one!

286
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,872  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
Prepare my obituary!

287
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,592  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:516
I long for two things
all year.

288
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,510  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:510
I wouldn't mention the first.

289
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,955  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:516
We had to carry you
down to our camp.

290
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,199  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
You wait, tonight.
The starry sky above me

291
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,309  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:510
and the devil within.

292
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,279  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'd dare come with us
on our night ride?

293
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,631  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sure, without
the walkie- Talkies thought.

294
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,597  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:510
D' you know what I dreamt about?
Katherine.

295
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,118  X1:247 X2:470 Y1:448 Y2:510
Sex in marriage!
Tell us!

296
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,798  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
She appeared in a transparent
night- Gown and said:

297
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,712  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:510
- What's all that row?
- The Punic Wars.

298
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,512  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
Two things
she'll never forgive...

299
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,471  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
If we break anything,
particularly Granny's plates!

300
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,199  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:510
That was the first.

301
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,994  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:510
And the second?

302
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,556  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'll show them!
I'll chop up their bottoms!

303
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,235  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wasn't it a lovely day
today?

304
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:10,189  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
Once upon a time
there was a cottage

305
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,193  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:448 Y2:510
and that cottage
was enchanted!

306
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,235  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
- An old witch lived there!
- She locked the children up!

307
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,199  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:516
No old woman.
No children. Vampires!

308
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,310  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Just the thing to make them sleep well!
- Stupid joker,

309
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,110  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
can't trust him with anything.
We'll never get off.

310
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,118  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
- They weren't ordinary vampires...
- Put another story on, dammit!

311
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,749  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
...who fly by night,
they sucked their blood by day!

312
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,999  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:484 Y2:510
Whose?

313
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,270  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:510
Three kind men's.

314
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,829  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Albert, I'm thirsty!
- Wake your own Daddy!

315
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,954  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
My Daddy's not here!

316
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,434  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where's Peppa, Mike?

317
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,750  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:448 Y2:516
Didn't want to intrude sweet dreams.
Married sex isn't my hobby stop.

318
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,039  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
Left a telegram, the idiot!

319
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,840  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Good night.
- And tomorrow we go?

320
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,558  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Where?
- To the Huntsman's Ball!

321
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,473  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Do we buy a raffle- ticket?
- Sure, to win a capon!

322
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,115  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:516
And give it a roasting!

323
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,034  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
Lot's look truth in the eyes.

324
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,359  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
Our situation isn't simple.

325
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,955  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:510
What did those women
teach the kids?

326
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,837  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
To cant, sleep, piss and shit.
When they don't have it

327
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,468  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:516
they start screaming.

328
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,117  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:516
All they ever hear is

329
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,469  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
""eaten up, good boy""
""that's a nice pat in your pot""

330
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,115  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:516
""the darling's growing a tooth""

331
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,116  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:516
So he can gobble up more still.

332
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,469  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:510
Casanova's rolled out of bed!

333
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,117  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:510
What was it like?

334
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,358  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:516
Fantastic.
There's a girls' school down here.

335
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,838  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:516
We want to go climbing!

336
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,834  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
No ski- Ing,
no climbing today.

337
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,559  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let's look reality in the face.
Just remember the good old times.

338
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,074  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:510
We used to share alike.

339
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,832  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:510
There's three of us,
six kids.

340
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,600  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:510
So I snitched some biscuits.

341
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,316  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
Six divided by three is two.

342
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,439  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:510
That means we should each
look after two children.

343
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,557  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
How'd you share those out?

344
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,839  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:510
No favouritism,
we'll draw lots.

345
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,557  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:510
Draw lots for our kids?

346
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,278  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:448 Y2:510
Never! Wants to get rid
of Matthew.

347
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,354  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:448 Y2:510
Attention!
Order no.2!

348
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,593  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Dog- Team racing!

349
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,473  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:516
How can we race
without dogs?

350
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,997  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I saw a St. Bernard's yesterday!
- No dog around today at all.

351
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,198  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:510
Did you hear?
Our work's cut out for us.

352
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,757  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:516
To excite their imagination!

353
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,590  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:516
To ignite the light
of knowledge!

354
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,278  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:510
In other worlds our aim is

355
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,708  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:516
to awaken the human
being in them!

356
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,592  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Isn't it magnificent when a guy
has quiver- Full of kids?!

357
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,035  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:448 Y2:516
Get a move on,
you lazy dogs!

358
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,439  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:510
Watch it!

359
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,392  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're taking bets.
Who bets on your team, wins!

360
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,235  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:510
Let's draw lots!

361
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,876  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
- For our own kids? Newer.
- Let's swop, thou.

362
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,590  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:516
Let me have Bertie,
you have Dacie.

363
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,758  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:510
I want Dacie!

364
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,238  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Can we have her on our team?
- Sure!

365
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,832  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:516
You can have her
if Albert gives us Katie.

366
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,238  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:510
- He'd have none left!
- He'll still have Matthew!

367
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,559  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
No more lets accepted!
Team to your machines!

368
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,832  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:510
Ready for the start!
Go!

369
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,555  X1:279 X2:440 Y1:484 Y2:516
A dog's life!

370
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,709  X1:340 X2:378 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hi!

371
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,357  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:448 Y2:516
Think up something
more intelligent!

372
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,313  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
The state we'll be in tonight

373
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,038  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:516
You should husband
your strength, true.

374
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,598  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:448 Y2:510
A girls' school learning ski- Ing.
All those birds!

375
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,713  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now a competition
In sausage- Eating!

376
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,069  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:510
No diving kids by two, though.
To each his own!

377
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,028  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
That her breasts are a miracle
did you say that before or after?

378
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,914  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:484 Y2:510
Before.

379
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,115  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
She awoke a passion in me
I' d never experienced before.

380
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,030  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
Rock him!
What happened then?

381
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,431  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
...laughter... and then...
...sweet nothing

382
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,437  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:510
...and then...

383
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,309  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:516
Rock him, you shirker!
Can' t you see how busy we are?

384
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,993  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
I picked her up in my arms
and suddenly I felt a pain...

385
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,473  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
No wonder,
Matthew's got wind too.

386
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,997  X1:100 X2:619 Y1:448 Y2:516
Not even a cement- Mixer could digest
the muck you cook. Right, Matthew?

387
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,353  X1:283 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:516
Ignore him.

388
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,117  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:516
He envies us our good kids.

389
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,116  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:516
That's all I remember.
I seemed to be falling...

390
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,595  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
- And then?
- The earth trembled...

391
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,835  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
I heard the earthquake too.
The postman stopped by.

392
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,713  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
Sorry, there's
no girl's school around.

393
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,558  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who say I stuck around here?

394
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,995  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:483 Y2:510
I wont off to Kamenná.

395
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,119  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:516
You went all that way

396
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,753  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:516
because instinct told you
there were pretty girls around?!

397
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,716  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'd arranged the date
before- Hand!

398
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,477  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you're coming with me
you'd better get a move on!

399
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,118  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
Aren't you taking Matthew off?

400
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,713  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm an Indian squaw!

401
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,549  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
Peppa's telling a story tonight.
I want Matthew to sleep.

402
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,317  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
Albert's an Indian squaw
and Peppa's telling the story!

403
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,953  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:516
Right about burn!

404
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,915  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
We must watch out tonight.
No falling asleep!

405
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,318  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:510
Think he wants to trick us?

406
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,479  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:516
His willingness is suspicious,
considering he's got a date.

407
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,954  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:516
See, we can manage
without Mummy!

408
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,989  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:448 Y2:516
But Mummy takes
my slippers off!

409
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,230  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:516
By the way,

410
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,390  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:510
she was fragrant with bitter almonds
and had cherries behind each ear.

411
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,352  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Bottled?!
- Don't keep interrupting him.

412
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,999  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:516
Just se's he gets his fruit right.

413
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,232  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
That was rose- Hip tea.

414
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,870  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
You won't catch a bug,
in the army you drunk bilgo- Water.

415
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,113  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's a clean baby.

416
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,357  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:510
The tea was sweet.

417
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,391  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:516
A cold bath brings deep sleep.

418
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,035  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Once there were two huts...
- But not ordinary huts.

419
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,116  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:516
- They were under a spell...
- They were shit- huts.

420
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,116  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
No old witch lived in them...
Nor children for fattening...

421
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,714  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Two good people...
- You and me!

422
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,591  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:510
D' you know what I'd like to be
if I weren't human?

423
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,719  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:448 Y2:510
A magician!
To save me!

424
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,115  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:448 Y2:516
- A Daddy...
- Why?

425
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,517  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
What is this?
There's a night- Pot in the hall!

426
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,998  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:510
- There's a queue by day!
- We want to be alone!

427
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,752  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:516
Come along!

428
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,230  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:516
It's our wedding- Chamber!

429
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,120  X1:312 X2:406 Y1:484 Y2:516
Let go!

430
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,589  X1:317 X2:400 Y1:484 Y2:511
Quiet!

431
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,230  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I have to ask you something.
- Shut up!

432
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,876  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:516
Terribly important.

433
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,759  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
Not another world!
Or I'll pull you apart like a snake!

434
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,072  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:510
Daddy, do snakes make
rude noises?

435
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,113  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:516
Mike, don't sleep!

436
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,592  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:516
Two things I'd never give up.

437
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,914  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
A good friend
and a night full of stars.

438
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,392  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:516
Nothing going to night.
They're all awake.

439
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,594  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:516
Aren't you going to sleep?

440
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,149  X1:336 X2:382 Y1:484 Y2:510
No.

441
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,357  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
Lonely- Girl steak
spiced with real tears,

442
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,317  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:510
canapes stuffed with louging
for our dear hubbies.

443
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,671  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
D' you know the difference
between us?

444
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,915  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
You have two grannies
for you kids and I none.

445
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,239  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
Maybe Gabina has news.

446
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,315  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:510
Tomorrow we past the apple- Pie
and that's that.

447
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,191  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
Must we past the parcel?

448
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,436  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I bet you feel Ionely for them too.
- Permit me to remind you

449
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,710  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:516
that nobody invited us.

450
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,154  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Don't we have any pride?
- We do.

451
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,750  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:516
If we didn't, thought,
we'd know how they're doing.

452
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,913  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:510
For two night he's tricked us!
This time wo'll show him what for!

453
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,833  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
Good morning, friends.

454
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,310  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:516
I waited for the shop to open.

455
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,310  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Did the earth tremble again?
- Twice.

456
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,793  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:448 Y2:510
The third time she showed me
the Seventh Wonder of the World!

457
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,070  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:516
Today's programme!

458
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,311  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
Slalom competition on anything!

459
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,151  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
That ski- Jump down there
mind you keep away from it!

460
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:25,554  X1:142 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
No child- Raising schemes today

461
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,828  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:516
and similar tommy- Rot,
we have a single aim in view

462
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,193  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:510
to exhaust the kids

463
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,751  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:516
and Peppa.

464
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,430  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
We'll husband our resources
for tonight.

465
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,870  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Who'll be the spectators?

466
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,358  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:510
Me ands Mike of course.

467
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,953  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
What will my Daddy be?

468
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,632  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:516
He'll be the fore- Runner,
the operation centre.

469
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,236  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
And emergency squad.

470
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,597  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
There they go the first contestants
the popular coal- Bin team,

471
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,995  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
they know the run
they're on home ground!

472
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,431  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:516
Very clever, these children!

473
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,470  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:510
And that's very surprising!
All we know about them is

474
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,915  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:510
that their father if he is their father
is of unsotard mind

475
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,750  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
spending the autumn of his life
in the care of a story male nurse.

476
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,948  X1:223 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:515
Here comes another
famous contestant,

477
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,277  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516

478
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,190  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good, he's made it! He's hurtling
forwards now he's off- Course

479
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,032  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:510
another obstacle will he make it
between the shit- Huts?

480
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,916  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
- He made it!
- Let's have a go too.

481
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,312  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Remember last year?
I scraped you off a tree- Trunk!

482
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,552  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:510
Only tore my wind- Cheater.
Come on...

483
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,990  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:510
Watch the track!

484
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,556  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:515
Christ, that's Dacie's!

485
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,039  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
Here she comes!
Dacie's a great fighter!

486
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,870  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:516
Go, go!

487
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,753  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:510
Watch out for the favourite!

488
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,599  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:516
From a word- Rouewn sports family,

489
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,274  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:510
he'll make the best time!
Not There!

490
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,595  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Mike, are you okay?
- I squashed my tiddler!

491
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,232  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What?
- My tiddley- wink!

492
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,592  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm coming!

493
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,352  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:516
This, dear friends, is the crowning
glory of our programme...

494
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,235  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:448 Y2:516
Help!
The buggy!

495
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,430  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Yes, the next machine'!

496
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,595  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help! Matthew!

497
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,753  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help!

498
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,830  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:510
Catch him!

499
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,675  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:510
Got him.

500
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,278  X1:281 X2:439 Y1:448 Y2:516
First aid?
A surgeon?

501
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,119  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:516
Now the men's category.

502
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,354  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
I don't advise you to wear those.

503
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,239  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:484 Y2:516
Why not?

504
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,677  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:510
Don't let him!

505
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,230  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:515
We'd have to look after
his kids, and him too!

506
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,272  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
The hospital's 20kms away!

507
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,955  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:510
A combination event-with the kids.

508
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,636  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:516
Isn't this great?

509
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,558  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:516
What'll Matthew bathe in tonight?

510
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,873  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:448 Y2:510
Go, go!
Hurrah!

511
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,712  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
Now you're staring, huh?

512
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,837  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:516
Pity Kate's not here,
she'd really go for it!

513
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,749  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:516
Go, go!

514
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,435  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:448 Y2:510
Watch it!
Here I come!

515
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,077  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:516
But my time was best!

516
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,470  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
Got anything to wear
of your Daddy's?

517
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,831  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
Only my Mummy's.

518
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,879  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:516
Never mind,
as long as it isn't Matthew's.

519
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,431  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I think you should examine me.
- I know you in and out.

520
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,551  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:448 Y2:515
- But you're a doctor!
- But of unsound mind,

521
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,033  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:516
in the care of
a strong male nurse.

522
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,553  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
The fun's over.
It's your duty to help.

523
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,472  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:510
All right.
Who'll be the nurse?

524
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,116  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
Me, that's my Daddy!

525
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,675  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:515
Take this down, nurse.

526
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,477  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
A bruised tail- End, a bump
of ripe melon size...

527
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,196  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes, Doctor?

528
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,430  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Looks like we'll have to operate.
- Right away?

529
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,791  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:510
An accident's no coincidence!

530
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,190  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
I recommended a day of leisure,

531
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,279  X1:137 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:510
but who takes a doctor's advice?

532
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,958  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:484 Y2:516
Nothing!

533
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,829  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:510
We are very lucky.
We have one shit- Shed left.

534
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,514  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:516
Why is it Peppa refuses
to take us along?

535
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,910  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:510
- He's in his pyjamas!
- Where? - In the wash- room!

536
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,476  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm dead- Beat today.

537
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,999  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's only 7.30,
and they're all asleep!

538
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,199  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm not going either.

539
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,593  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have a feeling
it wouldn't work out tonight.

540
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,708  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:484 Y2:510
Here's the clock.

541
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,912  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:516
Go to sleep.

542
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,755  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What was hat?
- A trap for Cinderella.

543
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,108  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:516
I can't wait
can't even fall asleep.

544
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,639  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:510
- You have such stupid ideas!
- We'll take the short- cut.

545
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,876  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's taken my wink- Cheater!

546
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,431  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Watch out-the dungeon!

547
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,396  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:516
Eagle calling the Kestrel!

548
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,673  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:510
Does anyone have such
a nit for a chum?

549
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,798  X1:329 X2:389 Y1:448 Y2:510
Yes.
I do.

550
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,069  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:510
How much further?

551
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,793  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:483 Y2:515
24 to Kamenná, then 5 to Hadovka

552
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,033  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:510
and then we walk 3 up
the mountain.

553
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,320  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Why are you stopping?
- I can hardly see.

554
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,756  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:516
I hoped we'd get there.

555
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,955  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:516
The children'll be sleeping.

556
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,556  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I certainly don't long
to catch my husband at it.

557
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,915  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:510
At what?

558
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,398  X1:171 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:516
What is this game, anyway?

559
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,675  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Why didn't you bring Albert and Mike?
- Oh, come on.

560
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,116  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:516
We could have had a party.

561
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,396  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:516
You don't like our party a doux?

562
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,390  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
Any other wife'd be overjoyed.

563
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,512  X1:283 X2:436 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Think so?
- Yes!

564
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,828  X1:151 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
You have your dinner and beer
and fall asleep like a log.

565
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,270  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:516
Small wonder.
Cooking for us all,

566
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,478  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:516
this trek at night
and back in the morning...

567
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,591  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:516
- My poor Cinderella!
- Tonight we make up for it.

568
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,752  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:516
Don't hurry...
No haste today.

569
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,955  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:516
We'll be alone all night.

570
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,068  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hello!

571
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,998  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:515
Yes, of course...

572
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,757  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:510
Katherine and Dacie are downstairs.

573
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,160  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:510
Yes of course.

574
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,912  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:516
They're coming up.

575
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,959  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't open!

576
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,950  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:516
They'd think I have a lover here!

577
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,116  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
If you do my lies'll come tonight!

578
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,551  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I don't understand.
- Don't bother trying.

579
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,990  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
What are you doing?
You're my husband!

580
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,038  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:516
Don't gossip for an hour!

581
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,032  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:516
They want to spend the night!

582
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,554  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:484 Y2:510
What?

583
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,756  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
I have to let them in.
The hotel's absolutely full!

584
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,078  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:516
The critical day has arrived,

585
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,274  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
so let's concentrate on making it
a Happy Day!

586
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,997  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:510
For that we need God News.

587
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:13,551  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:510
Peppino and Dacie locked
themselves into the shit- Hut!

588
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,668  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:516
God news is becoming ever rarer,

589
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,550  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:510
let us meet worse news with a smile.

590
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,589  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:516
Tidy the place up,

591
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,112  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
the surprise visit's
fast approaching.

592
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,118  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
Buy some round biscuits,
I'll be handing out medals.

593
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,356  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:448 Y2:516
Fun and games are over,
your ladies are on the way!

594
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,916  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's the limit!

595
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,193  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:516
The things he things of
to louse up our holiday!

596
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,469  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:510
Fool that I am
I wanted to break his fall

597
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,756  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
but we've been spoiling him.

598
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,310  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:510
When he comes back with the milk,
he'll shoot down.

599
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:18,556  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:516
Last night you missed a lot stop
Pity you weren't with us.

600
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,435  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What's that?
- A telegram.

601
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,558  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:510
You'll move him to tears.

602
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,831  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'll put it into verse.

603
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,271  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:516
Your thoughts are your own

604
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,391  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:516
but you must honour your husband
for the more intelligent being he is.

605
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,640  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:448 Y2:516
That was my granny's creed, my mother's
and I have a happy marriage too.

606
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,238  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
Ours is okay as well,

607
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,035  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:448 Y2:516
thought I'm not that good at pretending.
But one thing I admit.

608
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,754  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't know who I'm looking forward
to more the children or Michael.

609
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,834  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:515
Gabina seemed distrait,

610
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,555  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:516
and she didn't mention Peppa.

611
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,032  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:484 Y2:510
Hear that?

612
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,790  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:515
Christ, that's Matthew!

613
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,188  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
My sweat heart,
what have they done to you?

614
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,717  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:448 Y2:510
Albert!
Albert!

615
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,633  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Mummy, help! I am here!
- Where?

616
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,950  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help!

617
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,834  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Who did this to my darling?
- Peppino and Dacie.

618
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,954  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Where's your Daddy?
- We're playing hide and seek.

619
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,431  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:516
Daddy's handing out a medal
to whoever he doesn't see all day.

620
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,197  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:510
And set Matthew extra.

621
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,398  X1:119 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:516
How could they tie you up like this?

622
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:21,071  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're playing pirates,
I'll be the pirate next time.

623
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,236  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:448 Y2:516
You should learn from your Daddy,
he never lets anyone ok him.

624
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,560  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:516
Where's your father?

625
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,712  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:510
Indoors, they're playing doctors.
With a nurse.

626
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,028  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:448 Y2:516
She isn't really a nurse,
they're just pretending.

627
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,958  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:515
Where's Matthew, Albert?

628
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,994  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:510
Where's who?

629
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:05,035  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:510
Matthew-he was here.

630
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,316  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:516
Soon our baby around?

631
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,636  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:448 Y2:510
Hi, girls!
Come to check on us?

632
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,790  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:516
Give them a drink,
while I find my cigar.

633
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,031  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:510
Never seen a bonfire before?

634
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,593  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:516
Bertie, Katie, go and pack up!

635
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,590  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:516
Mike, Dacie,
we're going home!

636
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,155  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
Are you taking the kids?
All of them?

637
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,797  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:516
No, some we're leaving here.

638
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,118  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:516
- I'm staying!
- I want to stay with Peppino!

639
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,673  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:448 Y2:515
- And I with Daddy! - Mummy!
- Yes, Mike dear?

640
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,748  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:448 Y2:510
- I want a medal too!
- We want a medal!

641
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,751  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Dear friends,
we'll bring your medals home!

642
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,948  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
Your best idea yet.
A good thing Matthew can't talk.

643
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,675  X1:124 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:516
Last night the loving was lush stop

644
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,515  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:510
three girls for us two
was overmuch

645
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,592  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:516
they gave us all
they had stop

646
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,234  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:516
your absence
made us sad stop

647
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,159  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Not a stop further!
- Don't move!

648
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,632  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:510
Let's go.
Just look at them.

649
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,997  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
Setting fire to the cottage,
holding orgies

650
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,478  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
d' you know
what they love best?

651
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,314  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
When someone falls
for their stupid tricks.

652
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,274  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Bertie, is Mummy home?
- No, that's the parrot hollering,

653
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,953  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:516
Supper's in the cook- Book,
page 34.

654
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,430  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:510
Matthew!

655
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,357  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:515
- Did my wife call?
- No, Doctor.

656
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,390  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:447 Y2:516
Doctor Horák.
Is that you, my darling?

657
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,910  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:483 Y2:515
No, this is Mrs. Horák.

658
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,952  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Bertie's to croched a chain.
- Turn round slowly.

659
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:48,597  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
- And Katie's maths are wrong.
- You'll manage!

660
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:55,108  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:448 Y2:516
You have a talent for kids
and a university degree!

661
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,434  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm a glad you appreciate
the man you married.

662
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,990  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:510
I can leave the man I married.

663
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,838  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you left the man
you didn't marry,

664
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,714  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:516
that would make me really mad.

665
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,909  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:515
- And where's the patient?
- In bed, Doctor.

666
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,959  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No children in his room!
- Only his nurse.

667
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,873  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:516
Not today,
today it's serious,

668
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,278  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Well, and what's wrong?
- My head...

669
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,959  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:516
You didn't need a doctor for that,
I've known for 8 years now.

670
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,315  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:516
On returning

671
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,673  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:448 Y2:516
to an environment
of stress your organism...

672
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,673  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:516
What's the big idea?

673
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,676  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm too busy for words
and you want me to write you sick.

674
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,958  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:516
With mumps!

675
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,118  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
Suspect mumps will do, so I don't
have to go to nursery school.

676
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,872  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:516
I get no breakfast,

677
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,756  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:516
I just get playing hell

678
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,190  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:510
since our return.

679
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,471  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:516
The kids feed me
secretly on scraps.

680
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,274  X1:307 X2:412 Y1:484 Y2:510
Not me!

681
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,280  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:516
When I leave hospital
I'm off to get Matthew,

682
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,909  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:516
do the shopping,
cook supper,

683
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,720  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:510
supervize homework,
and fall to bed dead- Beat.

684
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,149  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:510
Luckily Kate's moved out
of the bedroom.

685
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,518  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:510
No strongth left in me
and that she mustn't know.

686
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,953  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:510
Isn't it odd.

687
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,993  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:516
Only Peppa deserves punishment.

688
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,757  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:516
And I saw him
and Gabina kissing.

689
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:43,552  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:516
I'm really disinterested
in Peppa's kisses and your mumps.

690
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,871  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:448 Y2:516
Come to our place
tomorrow evening.

691
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:54,269  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:448 Y2:516
Five drops three times a day...
and a warm pack.

692
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,308  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:516
You'll explain to Kate
about the plates and the bed

693
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,274  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:510
and the skirt with the heart.

694
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,878  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:516
And tell Peppa
you'll have to build a new shit- Hut.

695
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,070  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:510
You go on
as if she wanted a divorce.

696
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,118  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:448 Y2:516
You never know
how people react.

697
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:21,998  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:448 Y2:516
They can react negatively
even to the worst things.

698
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,751  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:516
Bertie, show Mummy
your good marks.

699
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,350  X1:194 X2:527 Y1:448 Y2:516
Mind you don't show her
you bad ones, Katie.

700
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,989  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
Here they are!

701
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,195  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:448 Y2:510
Good, hurry up.
Kate's aerobics class ends at 6.15!

702
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,551  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:516
Compote dishes, Bertie!

703
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,276  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
You play Indian squaw
at home too?

704
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,796  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:510
With one pair of hands
and three kids...

705
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,868  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
and two idiots for friends
who got me into trouble!

706
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,160  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Mike, hold Matthew.
- I'll open the door.

707
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,591  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:516
Peppa, you play
so she sees the good influence.

708
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,949  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're looking fantastic, Kate!
If Albert weren't my chum,

709
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,272  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:510
who knows...

710
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,988  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hurry up Albert!
Katie's hungry!

711
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,993  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:448 Y2:516
As soon as I've put
liver dumplings in the soup!

712
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,476  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Katherine loves them so!
- Don't forget the cloves!

713
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,275  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:516
Chin up, Dacie growls at me too
when I'm late serving dinner!

714
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:46,117  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
When I was a kid
I played hide and seek.

715
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,479  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:448 Y2:516
Now I seek a girl
with a pretty curl

716
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,268  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:516
for my nights!

717
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,870  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:448 Y2:510
Daddy taught us!
There's more!

718
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,153  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:516
With you the world is fun,
my darling Fanny

719
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,239  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:448 Y2:516
I love you for you are fun
fun from tip to fanny!

720
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,710  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:516
Shut up!

721
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,153  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:516
All night long!

722
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,713  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:516
For my nights!

723
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,756  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:516
If you don't eat
you skirt'll be too hight for me.

724
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,873  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:448 Y2:516
I told Albert
not to long me your things,

725
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,757  X1:215 X2:506 Y1:448 Y2:510
but he made me wear
that skirt!

726
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,276  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:516
Haha, aren't you funny.

727
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,154  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:516
Next thing you'll say
I let you smoke in bed.

728
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,153  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
He'd light up for me
every morning!

729
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,159  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
He's a good chum.

730
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,268  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:510
Then he declared
the Punic wars...

731
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,872  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:510
Do forgive him,
Albert was dead drunk.

732
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,712  X1:127 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:516
He pointed to your granny's plates
and said: Enemy targets!

733
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,148  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What are you saying?
- And the swing.

734
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,995  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:510
- The hammock, you mean?
- When he tore that?

735
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,352  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:448 Y2:515
- And the buggy!
- No, not that!

736
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,832  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What about the buggy?
- Oh, nothing.

737
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,998  X1:172 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:510
Albert was rocking Matthew
and it sort of shot off.

738
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,555  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:516
This is the end of our friendship!

739
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,357  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:515
Hello, Dacie!

740
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,468  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:448 Y2:510
No, don't worry.
I shan't tell him.

741
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,998  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:448 Y2:510
Had Mike and Pepa not made him mad
Albert wouldn't have told me.

742
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,997  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:516
Should I forgive Michael too?

743
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,276  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:516
Who prowled around at night?
Peppa.

744
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,115  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:510
Not a word to Gabina!

745
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:21,313  X1:130 X2:590 Y1:448 Y2:516
I told her this morning. Michael let
the cat out of of the bag too.

746
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,199  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:448 Y2:516
Enough!
It's dready.

747
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,630  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:515
Dumplings and beer
for lunch, I bet.

748
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,480  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:516
Faster by a second on four bars.

749
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,872  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:510
Four track's not on.

750
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,350  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:515
Come here, Michael.

751
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,356  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:516
I didn't sleep all night,
longing for revenge.

752
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,597  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:510
But-no.

753
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,872  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:516
It's time to stop.
I'll miss you, chums!

754
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,198  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
Next year on the NIATNUON!

755
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,992  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:510
Don't be ridiculous!

756
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,672  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:516
Did you spend
your night with me?

757
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,592  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:510
- So why can't you tell them so?
- I'd look such an idiot!

758
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,118  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:516
- After 7 years of marriage!
- And my loss of face?

759
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,239  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:516
Dacie warned me
of your antics.

760
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,950  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:510
Katie tried to console me.

761
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,870  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:448 Y2:516
Do you realize
what you've done?

762
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,553  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:510
- They think you're unfaithful to me!
- I didn't think of that.

763
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,351  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:516
But it must stay between
you and me, okay,

764
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,276  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:516
- No.
- I'll tell you then,

765
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,312  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:448 Y2:516
I described those
nights to them!

766
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,996  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What did you tell them?
- That you breads are miracles...

767
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,912  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Good... - That you shoved me
the 7th Wonder of the World.

768
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,355  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:510
And what's that?

769
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,950  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:510
That's what I don't know.

770
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,836  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:516
And they'd want to know.

771
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,879  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:516
So you made up...

772
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,358  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:516
I told them that you...

773
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,477  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:516
You're quite an Andersen.

774
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,271  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:516
No more fairy- Tales,

775
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,757  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:516
now comes the real thing.

776
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,278  X1:313 X2:405 Y1:484 Y2:510
Wait...

777
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,959  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:516
Mother's supposed to be calling...
Let go...

778
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,599  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:448 Y2:510
Gabina...
- Leave!

779
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:00,870  X1:284 X2:436 Y1:484 Y2:516
What's up?

780
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,116  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Peppino!
- Who called?

781
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,117  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:510
I don't know,
but he wanted a ransom.

782
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,315  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:516
He'll give me a heart attack.

783
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,873  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:516
Hello, Gabi,
yes hold as hostage too,

784
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:38,152  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:510
both of them.
He rushed over there.

785
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,679  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:516
3 kids aren't enough for you?

786
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,513  X1:132 X2:588 Y1:448 Y2:516
Wait and see this! Maffia methods
have nothing on me!

787
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,755  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:510
They'll be begging
on their knees!

788
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,278  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:516
Here they come!

789
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,472  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:484 Y2:515
And not to kneel, methinks!

790
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,270  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:510
So I shan't demand a ransom.

791
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,072  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Aren't you going to open up?
- You go, when I say.

792
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,599  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:484 Y2:510
Katie!

793
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,869  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:516
I'm going to hide, see?

794
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,159  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:516
- What's in there?
- Nothing. Daddy said so.

795
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,918  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:448 Y2:510
- Oh, your Daddy!
- Let Go!

796
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,595  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:484 Y2:516
Help!

797
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,229  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:516
Now we shan't let anyone in.

798
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,070  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:516
Can I tell you something?

799
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,556  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:516
- You are a horror.
- Sure, somebody has to be the best.

800
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,317  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:516
- Exaggerated modesty
is an ailment too. - Daddy!

801
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,279  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:516
Daddy!

802
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,910  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:448 Y2:516
Go and play, Bertie. Your Mum
and me have something on.

803
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,551  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:448 Y2:510
It's our Matthew
who's in that basket!

804
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,235  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:448 Y2:516
You're crazy, Albert!
I've had enough!

805
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,469  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:516
Peppa! Mike! Peppa!

806
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,349  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:510
I'm not in there!
I'm here!

807
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,553  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:448 Y2:516
We wouldn't bother
dragging you around!

808
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,279  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:510
Matthew's is there!

809
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,119  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:448 Y2:516
We're not falling
for your tricks again!

810
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:39,153  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:516
Stop!
My baby is in there!

811
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,917  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:510
What a trick, Bertie!
You deserve

812
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:50,279  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:516
...a real gold medal!
- Mummy thought of this one!
