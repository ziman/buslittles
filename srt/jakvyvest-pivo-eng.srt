director

8
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:50,551
Vašek, why is there a scarf around the whale's neck?

9
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:55,684
Because she's got a toothache!

10
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:15,085
What's up, boys? Don't you want me to give you a lift?

11
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:15,782
Yes!

12
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:17,905
You know him?

13
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,188
Of course. He's my daddy!

14
00:01:20,886 --> 00:01:22,010
And which one?

15
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:24,419
A spare one :)

16
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,084
That's impossible. My mum says that every prima man is already married.

17
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,575
Mann muss finden können :-P

18
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,453
Well, just like my mum!

19
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,909
I just took a tie, introduced myself as a minister...

20
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,969
...we had steaks, Pilsner beer and now we are friends.

21
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:00,743
When I grow up, I'll also deliver milk!

22
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:02,364
I'll be also work like my dad.

23
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,879
A claimber!

24
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:16,759
You are already here?

25
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,401
Yes.

26
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:20,862
I'll examine the exercise books at home,

27
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,759
he'll get new pyjamas

28
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,299
and make him turn the lights off at 8.

29
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,523
And Carla, no chocolate!

30
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,139
Aniczka, and what about dinner?

31
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm going to make it by myself.

32
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,894
Vašek! Vašíczek!

33
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,839
I know that you are at home.

34
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:43,310
Wow! Somebody washed the dishes here.

35
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:47,413
Somebody probably wants an ice-cream as a reward.

36
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,889
My darling!

37
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,328
So where is my nice little boy?

38
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,759
Baf! (you tell this to make somebody be frightened, but as a joke)

39
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:58,605
What's that?

40
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,447
It's a dog.

41
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:02,547
What did you promise to me? That you'll leave all the foreign dogs alone.

42
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,788
It's not a foreign dog. It's Arnold!

43
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,129
He's able to get the dust out of the duster.

44
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:07,871
Oh please...

45
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,084
If you liked him, he could be ours.

46
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,637
And who would take care of him?

47
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:16,845
You'll take him to Valentas in the evening? And at night Carla will go with him, won't she?

48
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:22,808
If my dad was here, neither me nor the dog would have to go to Valentas.

49
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:26,281
You just decided, that you were going to make me upset.

50
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:30,274
Didn't you promise to me, that you wouldn't talk about it?

51
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,625
I'd also like to have a friend.

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,349
You'll get a dog. A nicer one.

53
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,274
But when you are older.

54
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,914
He's nice. He is friends with children.

55
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,672
He catches the second league.

56
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,231
Who? The dog?

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,993
No. His master. He's prima.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,797
A goalkeeper.

59
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,533
Please, what are you talking about? Which goalkeeper?

60
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,907
Our school caretaker. You're definitely going to like him!

61
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,547
Why would I be supposed to like him?

62
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,157
Because he's not married.

63
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:04,463
So, look. You'll return that dog immediately
and I don't want to hear a word about marriage.

64
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,738
(ballet Romeo and Juliet)

65
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:22,244
Damn it, I'm going to have a bruise again!

66
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:27,623
Paris is a boor. But Julie should be gentle.

67
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:32,273
But it wasn't Paris, but that idiot Romeo.

68
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,215
Thanks.

69
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,935
One sunday again.

70
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,260
The third one in this month.

71
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,001
When corps from Varšava (Warschau) comes, you're going to have holiday for a whole week!

72
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,335
And what about rehearsals?

73
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,957
Don't you really want to go somewhere to have a dinner?

74
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,848
Vašek decided that we miss somebody at home.

75
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,679
How so? You explained it to him.

76
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,372
I thought it was over.

77
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:44,879
It was. Until his friend's mother got married.

78
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:52,587
Vašek is going to get over it. When he's older, he'll have another problems.

79
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:56,522
What if he doesn't get over it?

80
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:03,879
I hope, you're not going to reproach. After 4 years.

81
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,866
You can't let Vašek talk to all your stuff.

82
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:10,397
I've already forbidden him to talk abou marriage.

83
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,707
That's right.

84
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,214
It's even worse.

85
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,764
Yesterday he put the third bowl with a toothbrush on the shell in a bathroom.

86
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,577
You overstimate it everything.

87
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,747
I'll wait for you, won't I?

88
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,143
I told you it's not possible.

89
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:36,450
Vašek is at Valentas?

90
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,563
No, Carla is at our place.

91
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:43,574
Last you had free time 10 days ago.

92
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:07,615
If you want to, come upstairs.

93
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,629
You are really able to make it easier for me...

94
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,078
I have free time on the next sunday.

95
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:36,629
We'll go to the cinema to watch Funes. Do you want to?

96
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:40,643
Or you can invite Standa and you can play with cars.

97
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:45,225
Standa can't come now. Now he drives with that new daddy with milk.

98
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,168
He's got rabbits! And also a new grandpa.

99
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:52,328
Mummy... I'd also want a grandpa. At least one.

100
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:55,224
Tell me rather, where you yesterday pulled your trousers apart.

101
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,088
I was tracing.

102
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:59,123
A dog again?

103
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,774
No, a sport teacher.

104
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,413
Vašek?!

105
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,020
I'm detectiv Colombo. He's not married!

106
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:13,365
You know what, Colombo? I'll really give you a few slaps!

107
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:17,321
I'd take it. Mainly if we are going to be 3!

108
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,972
Look, Vašík.

109
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:26,379
If you hide the toothbrush by yourself and you wish something reasonable, I'll give it to you, right?

110
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,119
Come on.

111
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:30,016
All right.

112
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,513
You'll take me to the mountains. On these holidays.

113
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,933
Couldn't you wish something better? What about seaside in summer?

114
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:42,119
Why don't you ever want to go to the mountains? Because dad was a claimber?

115
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,842
Becuse the theater doesn't have a winter holiday.

116
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,512
You'll make them, then.

117
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:47,494
You will arrange it?

118
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:48,264
Of course!

119
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,392
And how, please?

120
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:50,541
Look!

121
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,854
You're my darling!

122
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,431
Can you ski?

123
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:11,564
I must not ski. What if I broke a leg?

124
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:14,701
Eat! We'll talk about it later.

125
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:19,439
Don't be afraid, mummy. I won't get killed like my dad.

126
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:30,685
Everybody is going to the mountains!
All of the boys have a dad, only I don't have even a dog!

127
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,636
My mummy.

128
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:38,012
So, children. Before we start writing, we'll recall a mummy.

129
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,642
How she is, what she does, how she looks like...

130
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,774
-And what if both of them come?
-Doesn't matter, there where 6 of them in our place.

131
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,746
-At one moment?!
-No, one after another.

132
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:57,368
Benda, Martinec. Put your exercise books on the table, you'll take an exercise paper
and you'll rewrite the essay after the lessons.

133
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:02,751
Please, comrade teacher, I can't do it today. I have to cook dinner.

134
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,140
Vašek, don't clown. Sit down!

135
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:08,026
Talk, children, how is your mummy?

136
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,095
Nice.

137
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,923
Nice-eyed.

138
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,584
Curly-haired.

139
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,211
Truthful.

140
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,168
Vašek!

141
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:19,224
I'm already writing it!

142
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:31,695
One, two, one, two,... (he just counts and says some ballet stuff I don't understand :-P)

143
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:18,644
Spartacus is the greatest man of antiquity and a role of Friga is a great chance for you.

144
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,174
It's getting dark, they are both free.

145
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:23,956
Get ready.

146
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,607
And go.

147
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:30,516
Everything is in the music, so listen to it.

148
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,467
You are happy.

149
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,855
This is useless... I can't work like this!

150
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:46,461
I got up at 6 o'clock.

151
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,440
How many opportunities do you think you are going to have?

152
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,845
You're going to be a retired before someone writes another ballet!

153
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,127
Everybody can arrange it.

154
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:56,019
-Everybody has a grandma.
-What about your mother?

155
00:12:56,627 --> 00:13:02,453
You know her. She thinks that if she left for a few days,
the hospital would collapse.

156
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,829
So you want to leave...?

157
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:14,771
The week in february, when the school holidays are, I don't have
performances, I thought that if you left me, I would...

158
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,196
After what I told you?

159
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:19,766
I'm going to compensate all the rehearsals.

160
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:26,337
I'm nearly at all at home. I can't stand the boy!

161
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:29,175
That's out of the question. You're not going anywhere!

162
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:37,673
(there is a voice from radio, which talks about claimbers, who are on Mount Everest)

163
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:27,472
Oh my god! Leave it alone, please. The steaks were supposed to be on sunday.

164
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,353
Go to wash yourself.

165
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:47,257
I wonder that you can listen to it...

166
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,894
You bought a beer?

167
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:34,751
I'm asking you, why you bought the beer?

168
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,740
I thought he would come.

169
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:38,069
Who?

170
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,219
Minister.

171
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:45,560
Aniczka? You should go.

172
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,583
You know what, Carla? Vašek can take TV to his room.

173
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,243
There's Chaplin at 19:30.

174
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,928
I don't want Chaplin. I want you to be at home! Just like a right mum...

175
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:29,670
To make Vašek to be a main class cleaner is just like
making a goat to be a gardener.

176
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,005
But this week he was better.

177
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:43,158
It was really cleaned in the class and in addition
he was helping the school caretaker and sport teacher.

178
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,580
I thought he did something wrong, when you called me to the theater.

179
00:16:49,062 --> 00:16:52,495
We wrote and essay yesterday.

180
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,496
Please, don't tell Vašek that I let you read it.

181
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:12,679
He's a mug. "Mummy is going to get married." Such a nonsense.

182
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,152
Do you know, what is the best about children?

183
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,603
That they can see a world, how it is supposted to be.

184
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:26,953
And their world is mainly harmonic home.

185
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:34,514
And what would you do, if you were me, Mrs. teacher?

186
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:40,045
I would at least think about it, mummy.

187
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,092
You're going to let me go to the mountains.

188
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,897
You'd have to resign in the theater.

189
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:13,026
I can also break up with you.

190
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,775
Mummy! Mummy is here.

191
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,714
You don't even speak to me...

192
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:31,274
Guess, who came to have dinner with us?

193
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:45,943
If it didn't involve us, we could just laugh at the Vašek's ideas.

194
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:49,330
That's really funny to make steaks for school caretaker...

195
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:53,250
Do you go somewhere in the evening?

196
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,072
To theater.

197
00:18:56,145 --> 00:19:02,422
Why don't you call me? If I don't have night shift, I'll be able
to wait here with Vašek until 11.

198
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,902
And in the evening you'll go through the whole Praha.

199
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,415
And what about Jindrich?

200
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:15,856
If he had children, I wouldn't say a word. But in this situation...

201
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,802
Do you think, this is a life, Anna?

202
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,516
Er hat mich gern :-P

203
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,323
Then why doesn't he finally get divorced?

204
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:27,002
Please, let it be.

205
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:28,976
All right then.

206
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,870
I'll talk to Jindrich by myself.

207
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,566
You've never meddle.

208
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:39,017
I'm not going to humiliate myself.

209
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,077
You behave just like the life hasn't learnt you enough.

210
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,777
How long do you want to handle it by yourself?

211
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,397
It's hard with you, Anna.

212
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:57,958
When I told you in that situation a baby shouldn't be born,
you didn't talk to me for a half year.

213
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:00,178
You did it your way.

214
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:04,633
You didn't know what was going to meet you.

215
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:10,099
Talk to Jindrich. You'll rescue yourself only if you get married.

216
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:14,788
You can always give me an advise. But you can't
help me and take Vašek to the mountains.

217
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:19,556
I've already told you that mothers with children will
get holiday in that school holidays week.

218
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,020
Then I have bad luck, that I don't work as a surgery nurse.

219
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,181
I'll take Vašek to my place.

220
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:37,051
No, that wouldn't help. All the people in the house
know me, somebody could tell Vašek something...

221
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,856
Once Vašek will know it anyway.

222
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,977
How long are you going to hide it from him?

223
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,227
Many children live only with a mother.
Aren't there divorced marriages?

224
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:54,693
But you are not divorced...

225
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:26,294
Come on, little dog, come on. Don't be afraid. This is my mummy.

226
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:29,795
Send that calf away immediately!

227
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:46,742
Mummy! What about me??

228
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,445
Mummy, why was uncle Jindrich at the train station with a flower?

229
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,882
He came to tell me not to break a leg.

230
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,060
You like him?

231
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,041
A lot.

232
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:22,718
But it's also going to cost a lot of money.

233
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,053
I meant Jindrich.

234
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,553
Why are you talking about it again?

235
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:31,129
I don't like him. I'd know about better guys.

236
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:38,320
Vašek, I'm warning you. I took you here with one
condition - that you'll stop finding me a groom.

237
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,510
You can rely on me.

238
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,328
Daddy, daddy, I can't find sticks!

239
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:59,634
Then buy a medicine against sclerosis.

240
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:09,477
Thank you. Mrs. Bendová, you have telegram here.

241
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:12,388
Here.

242
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:24,127
I need to call Praha. Quickly. And
second call at 7 pm.

243
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:25,511
All right.

244
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,004
Vašek! You won't leave terrace until I come!

245
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:39,228
Of course!

246
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:49,640
Attention!

247
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,644
I'm going!

248
00:23:52,302 --> 00:23:53,515
Out of the way!

249
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,286
Attention!

250
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,301
I'm going!

251
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:15,717
Stupid boy! If I were your dad, I would beat your
buttocks that you wouldn't be able to sit for a week!

252
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,902
-Are you ok?
-Yes.

253
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:20,250
-What about your legs?
-Tangled.

254
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:25,107
Stand up then.

255
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:27,325
-Where are you from?
-From a Snowhite!

256
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:30,437
From a Snowhite? Hm. I'm really happy.

257
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:36,190
With who are you here? Why are you looking at me?
With who are you here?

258
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,402
With mum, of course!

259
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:49,140
Take your ski and go.

260
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:59,408
Hey, sir, are you married?

261
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,552
Vašek, Vašíczek, come quickly!

262
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,600
This sweater really suits you, you are very nice in it.

263
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,042
How so you are not wearing pyjamas?

264
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:12,904
Am I supposted to go to the dinner in pyjamas?

265
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:15,237
No. We are going to have dinner here.

266
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:20,369
Mum, Mummy, I want to go to a bar. At least for an ice-cream.

267
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,899
No, you have a lot of sins today and I have ordered a call.

268
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,549
Mummy, I arranged something. He's going to wait there for me.

269
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:32,041
Who?

270
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,137
One of my friends.

271
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,823
I'll return in a while.

272
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,227
And you - stay at the room, do you understand?

273
00:26:25,716 --> 00:26:26,637
Anna.

274
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:34,793
Oh wow, you grew up! Even though you are still so small.

275
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:38,197
You don't remember me.

276
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,050
-I...
-Don't you remember?

277
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,971
I'm waiting here.

278
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,395
I'm sorry.

279
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:55,816
No, the telegram wasn't sent by Jindrich, but by theater.

280
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:58,966
Mummy... Please, come and stay at least those 2 days.

281
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:03,717
I can't tell Vašek that we've just arrived
and we are going to go home again.

282
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,777
I'm going to return on thursday.

283
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,985
It's not important, who's sick.

284
00:27:09,985 --> 00:27:12,626
There's just change in the theater.

285
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:17,248
We can't do anything then.

286
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:28,027
-How much is it?
.Moment. I'll ask the post office.

287
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,243
How many years haven't we seen each other?

288
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:40,356
You are on holiday here? As an instructor again?

289
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,948
I've been here for 7 years.

290
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:42,699
Here?

291
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,647
Here I have a date with one boy.

292
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,644
With a boy?

293
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:52,265
I even don't know his name. I promised him to have an ice-cream
with him in the evening and I've met you here!

294
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:55,783
You are better and better. Instead of shot
you invite boys for and ice-cream?

295
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:59,782
But he's really small. You haven't seen such boy yet.

296
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:04,106
He told me his mummy loves dancing and if I wanted,
he could take her with him.

297
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,369
Please, why are you telling me?

298
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,657
Well, you asked me what I was doing here.

299
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,726
Maybe we'll meet again.

300
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,428
Definitely.

301
00:28:14,097 --> 00:28:17,635
So don't delay yourself. Don't make him waiting in the bar.

302
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,322
He isn't waiting in a bar. He's there.

303
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,143
Vašek! Come here!

304
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,314
You have a prima boy.

305
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:25,866
He's wild. What is this?

306
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,038
That's a jacket.

307
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,551
Say goodbye and go to bed.

308
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,177
Goodbye.

309
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:30,965
Bye.

310
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,584
Praha. Who wanted to pay the Praha?

311
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:41,341
I'll pay it.

312
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:53,096
Mummy! Mummy! Open! I didn't tell anything! Really!
Mummy! Open!

313
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,995
Vašek, you are going to worry me to death. What did you tell him?

314
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,178
Only number of our room.

315
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:03,826
And you invited him, didn't you?

316
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,274
Yes, I wanted you to look at him.

317
00:29:07,274 --> 00:29:08,087
What?

318
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:12,375
If we liked him, that we could be friends with him.

319
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,047
That's all.

320
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:19,024
Pack your stuff up. We're going home.

321
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,666
Tomorrow.

322
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,398
Mountain Rescue.

323
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,654
No. He's on the hill.

324
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:47,790
What are you doing here?

325
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,598
I came for help.

326
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:50,608
What happened?

327
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,663
Mummy forbade me to talk about the goodbye.

328
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:53,821
About what?

329
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:55,593
That we are going home today.

330
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,513
She promises to return, but we won't return.

331
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,709
I know her!

332
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:05,157
You finally call. How is it on the hill?

333
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:08,038
If mum knew that I'm under chief's control...

334
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,523
Snowslip situation?

335
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:13,348
I'll take care of myself anyway. I'll sweep, I'll do laundry.

336
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:18,847
When it's warmer, when it's warmer.
Warn these destinations immediately.

337
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:23,547
Please, sir, let me stay here.
I'm made for mountains.

338
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:27,056
So you want to work here? How many years?

339
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:29,847
2 days. Before mum comes.

340
00:30:30,355 --> 00:30:31,292
Who's that boy?

341
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,940
Well, he's such Dokey from Snowhite, isn't he?

342
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,293
You make jokes and there's blocked
groomer in Labský dùl.

343
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:40,053
I've been happy for that for a half hour now.

344
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:44,256
Call Karel. I'll be there.

345
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,625
And what about me?

346
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:49,474
You know what?
Right man never begs.

347
00:30:56,736 --> 00:30:59,469
If it helps you, you can leave the boy here.

348
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,584
Vašek?

349
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:05,636
You have more boys?
It's hard for him. He's just come and must back to the town.

350
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:06,873
Well, he'll get over it.

351
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:13,454
There are things, which no woman can understand.
Simply - I'll take care of Vašek for those 2 days.

352
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,228
I don't understand why.

353
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:21,003
We haven't opportunity to talk yet.
I'll be sure that you're going to return.

354
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,507
You would be able to take care of a child??

355
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,162
You can rely on me!

356
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,408
I'm not sure.

357
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:48,437
Vašek, we'll go to Rokytnice for sticks.
And we'll take mum to the train station.

358
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,670
Vašek, you're really going to let me go alone?

359
00:31:51,897 --> 00:31:53,897
You've already allowed me that. Don't worry.

360
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,221
Luboš rescues people from snowslips!

361
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,216
What do you mean - Luboš? It's always Mr. Richman for you!

362
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:04,111
Mummy doesn't know that we've been already friends for 2 hours.

363
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:05,884
Vašek is coming with me!

364
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:10,757
You have a great seat at the window.
Don't worry, I took care of the whole section.

365
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,333
I'll die from fear anyway.

366
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,787
That would be a pitty.

367
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:19,383
Mummy is prima. She started "duzing".

368
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,927
Bye.

369
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:50,010
How did you recognise that I'm a claimber?

370
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,054
I'm detectiv Colombo. You have crampons in your cabin.

371
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:55,980
You know what it is??

372
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:57,666
Of course!

373
00:32:57,924 --> 00:32:59,708
Metal boots for climbing.

374
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,073
Look, where you are throwing the snow!

375
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,917
And what is Chomolungma?

376
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:11,605
Mount Everest. Hillary and Tenzing were the first people there.

377
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,397
And which mountain over 8000m high was first visited by people?

378
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:19,930
Annapurna.

379
00:33:20,618 --> 00:33:23,088
And where were the most dead people?

380
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:24,607
Nanga Parbat

381
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:27,635
And who was the first up there?

382
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:31,603
Hermann Buhl. He's my second favourite. After my daddy.

383
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:33,886
You are good.

384
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:42,226
I have books. Not humbled mountain. Tigers from Himalaya. That's on radio.

385
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,890
-Done?
-Done!

386
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:46,735
Go!

387
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,807
And who buys that books for you?

388
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,780
Daddy?

389
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:54,376
Daddy was also a claimber!

390
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:58,307
And what does he do now?

391
00:33:58,307 --> 00:33:59,887
Now he's dead.

392
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,922
Don't be mad with me, Vašek, I haven't known that.

393
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:11,067
When they were coming down, he was the last one.
And suddenly there was a snowslip.

394
00:34:11,814 --> 00:34:15,204
Wow! We rescued a groomer!

395
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,363
You'll take my sleeping bag.
One my friend once also borrowed it.

396
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:30,105
He got intestinal flu. That's really bad, when there's 20 degrees under 0.

397
00:34:30,105 --> 00:34:31,084
And where did you sleep?

398
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:33,431
Well, we didn't sleep.

399
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,799
Do you have a lot of friends?

400
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:40,893
No, I have know a lot of people.
Friends are boys who you can always rely on.

401
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:45,149
Mum says that daddy had no friends.

402
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,482
That's weird.

403
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:53,319
When you hold the same rope with somebody,
you must trust him. You cover his back and he covers yours.

404
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:55,829
Then there's a real friendship.

405
00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:01,725
Maybe mum thinks that somebody could rescue him. Some his friend.

406
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:41,220
I'd like to call Špindlerùv mlýn, 93439. Thank you.

407
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,388
You can call it off.

408
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,479
He called himself.

409
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:46,825
Who?

410
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,824
Špindl (= Špindlerùv mlýn)

411
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:53,345
He told me to write it. I might have sclerosis...

412
00:35:54,677 --> 00:36:00,389
Vašek ate 7 dumplings, brushed his teeth and now he's sleeping.

413
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,329
He's idiot. He makes fun of me.

414
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:10,749
But he called 1 hour later, that there's snowing outside and that he can't fall asleep.

415
00:36:10,749 --> 00:36:13,350
Boženka, I'm hungry!

416
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,049
Today you were great, Anna.

417
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,814
You made me really happy.

418
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:22,958
That is probably because I took a nap in the afternoon.

419
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:27,657
Took a nap? She was sleeping here for 3 hours as if she was dead.

420
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:35,307
Am I allowed to invite you for a dinner?

421
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:49,627
Oh my god...

422
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:53,594
I'll make 7 pieces of him!

423
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,777
Why did you try do make fire?

424
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:02,095
I just wanted to make toasts for you.

425
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,258
It's already on fire! You can rely on me.

426
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,578
You can rely on me too.

427
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:12,925
Look. I borrowed these boots for you.

428
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:16,132
You could wear your boots to the dancing lessons.

429
00:37:18,476 --> 00:37:22,516
Luboš, how does a man become a real claimber?

430
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,579
When he claimbs a first hill.

431
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:25,675
Which one?

432
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:31,687
That's not important.
When you like it, you'are going to be claimber for a whole life!

433
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:38,876
How?

434
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:45,064
Where to put your hands, legs, how to be warm.

435
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:49,171
That's simple. You make a mistake and you're dead.

436
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:53,552
I don't know... I'm sure my dad didn't make a mistake!

437
00:37:53,552 --> 00:38:01,675
I meant it another way.
A proper man is the most happy, when he can overcome the obsticles.

438
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:06,172
My dad was proper! Strong! One head taller than you.

439
00:38:06,172 --> 00:38:11,424
Of course. The best man goes always the last.

440
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,651
You were never afraid?

441
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:22,417
When you want to win, to beat a 8000m high mountain,
which has been here for millions ages, you must have self esteem.

442
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:23,482
So you weren't afraid.

443
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:25,145
I was afraid.

444
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:29,517
The wind in Himalayas sound like coming train!

445
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,718
Once it made me cry.

446
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:34,359
My dad was also in Himalayas.

447
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,276
Why didn't you return?

448
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:39,033
At night? We couldn't see.

449
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,316
And in the morning?

450
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,325
We started getting to the peak.

451
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:43,757
You managed it?

452
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,124
It was the happiest day in my life.

453
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:54,466
The sun rose. There was silent. Only rocks and ice.

454
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,912
You stand there and it seems like you are God.

455
00:38:57,912 --> 00:39:01,631
I'm also going to be God! But mum can't know that!

456
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,415
A lot of people think that every claimber is crazy.

457
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,253
I'm crazy.

458
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:10,180
I can see that. You're outting salt into your tea!

459
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,279
Hold tight!

460
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:22,563
(They just count or say nothing important ;-))

461
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:49,391
I was at lawyer.

462
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:52,595
You buy or sell anything?

463
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,363
At divorce lawyer.

464
00:40:55,446 --> 00:41:01,280
What if we 2 tried it with rules?

465
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:05,446
I only don't know if I will get used to Vašek.

466
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,699
Do you know how to pull a tooth to a whale?

467
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:45,253
You make a sea crane, you give a wagon of ? to a whale,
you prepare dynamit, 3, 2, 1, bum!

468
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,869
What are you laughing at?

469
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:52,920
I've never kissed a guy.

470
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,971
How so? You didn't like your dad?

471
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,405
I did! But I didn't know him yet.

472
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:06,793
-Listen, friend, aren't you accidentally a little babbler?
-Accidentally a big one!

473
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:10,857
Your dad was one head taller than me in the morning
and now you don't know him?

474
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:13,552
In that time I was little like this.

475
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,307
Mummy didn't get married again?

476
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:23,087
No. I'd also like a daddy. Standa has already a third one.

477
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:29,877
Mummy probably loved daddy a lot.
When somebody loves somebody, he can't forget him.

478
00:42:29,877 --> 00:42:34,363
You'd be surprised how angry she is when I draw Annapurna.

479
00:42:35,968 --> 00:42:37,527
Your daddy was at Annapurna?

480
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:40,415
Of course. There's his grave.

481
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,369
I was also at Annapurna.

482
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,106
With my daddy?

483
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:47,906
No, all of us returned home.

484
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:52,764
My daddy was in the special expedition.
They examined soil under the ice-berg.

485
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:58,814
Look, I'm a great dressmaker.

486
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:06,376
Wait, wait, wait.You want to claim
that your daddy was in expedition Annapurna with special geologic programm?

487
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,768
Of course.

488
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,109
And when was it?

489
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:11,101
When I was little like this.

490
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:14,856
Vašek, Vašek, what are you playing at me?

491
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:18,040
You were little like this and you remember that your dad had shoulders like this?

492
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,095
I have a photo at home.

493
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,885
And you've never seen your dad?

494
00:43:22,885 --> 00:43:25,596
I'm telling you, that I was little like this.

495
00:43:25,596 --> 00:43:27,666
And what is it, little like this? What is it?

496
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,055
When I was in my mummy's belly!

497
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,312
You're 8 years old?

498
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:34,088
Yes.

499
00:43:36,634 --> 00:43:39,883
And you were born in... September?

500
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:42,125
Damn it, you can see the future.

501
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,953
What are you doing?

502
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,051
I'm trying how snow is going to be tomorrow.

503
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,101
You don't have to do every crap like me.

504
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:16,817
Vašek, what would you say if I tried dating your mummy?

505
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,246
You would try it?

506
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:23,033
Would try it... I'll try it!

507
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:26,781
You like my mum?

508
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:31,032
-I like YOU!
-I like you too!

509
00:45:41,518 --> 00:45:43,990
-Luboš, you must be careful!
-About what?

510
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:50,772
That trying! Mum doesn't want to hear a word about marriage.
She nearly beaten me!

511
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,597
I'll do what I can.

512
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:01,683
-Vašek!
-Mummy!

513
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:31,795
What are you doing?

514
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:34,152
We arranged that, didn't we?

515
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:37,321
Yes, but kissing was Luboš's idea!

516
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:38,987
Stand up, lazy people! Stand up!

517
00:47:45,201 --> 00:47:49,258
One, two, one,... :)

518
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:04,582
The boy skies great, what do you think?

519
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:20,677
(I just can't explain what he's telling her,
he's just teaching her skiing :))

520
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:47,179
Anna, when did we date each other?

521
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:50,761
Do you know that I really can't remember?

522
00:48:51,377 --> 00:48:53,800
I think, we could count it.

523
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,861
You were at the conservatory.

524
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:00,797
It's not important today.

525
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,016
And hadn't it been before I went to Annapurna?

526
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:11,134
I really don't know.

527
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:13,174
If you think...

528
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:18,262
It only seems to me that Vašek wants to look like me.

529
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,292
As if I was his daddy.

530
00:49:22,768 --> 00:49:25,468
Well, it probably only seems like that.

531
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,745
Probably.

532
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,977
Vašek wants to look like everybody.
It was a school caretaker last time.

533
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:36,488
But school caretaker isn't a claimber.

534
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,646
Whose grave is under a snowslip.

535
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:44,061
To our last evening.

536
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,477
Why did you take me here?

537
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:51,175
I think it's really long time you weren't dancing.

538
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:55,808
Everything is like at these times.

539
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:58,629
No. Nothing can be repeated.

540
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:09,274
I'm leaving to Alps in a month.
Before that I'm going to be in Prague for a few days.

541
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:11,838
Think about the "datum" until that time.

542
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:14,589
Which datum?

543
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:19,880
You arranged me a funural - I'm going to arrange you a marriage.

544
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,933
Wait, who am I going to marry?

545
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,180
Me of course.

546
00:50:28,537 --> 00:50:28,537
I even didn't get married.

547
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:34,798
I haven't told you yet?
I have so miserable memory...

548
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:42,415
And you remembered that we had been here at these times?

549
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:46,205
There was the only music box here 9 years ago.

550
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:55,184
Do you remember about our bet
that you would bring a flower in 10 minutes?

551
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:57,331
And I lost.

552
00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:02,096
No. Mountain rescue called about emergency situation.

553
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:04,829
A man lost in Obøí dùl.

554
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,566
I'm glad that you remember details.

555
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:13,432
You rescued that man.
You return after midnight.

556
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:21,712
And why didn't you get married?

557
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:25,869
I was always more affected by mountains.

558
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,155
And what about now?

559
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,967
Now I'm not strong enough for the hills.

560
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,407
By that you mean you'd be strong enough for me.

561
00:51:36,622 --> 00:51:39,311
No. For our boy.

562
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:49,031
You don't have to tell me anything.

563
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:52,132
I won't reproach. We knew each other for 14 days.

564
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:53,663
9 days.

565
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,841
You dated somebody. And I was in the way.

566
00:51:58,168 --> 00:52:00,046
And what were you doing for that 8 years?

567
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:00,046
Who did you want to marry anyway?

568
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,443
Vašek is not your son.

569
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:07,718
You are lying. We met here. In december.

570
00:52:07,718 --> 00:52:10,578
I went to Himalayas in january. And the boy was born in september.

571
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:13,408
We returned from expedition in november. All of us.

572
00:52:13,662 --> 00:52:18,863
-Nobody stayed on Annapurna under a snowslip.
-I hope you won't be so stupid and you won't tell Vašek.

573
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:23,757
If this is your point - you can rely on me.

574
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:32,349
I was so happy with my friends that
I didn't realise I was living alone.

575
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:39,221
For example this Christmas.
There were a lot of people around me and no "my" person.

576
00:52:40,043 --> 00:52:43,267
And when I started thinking about it,
so prima boy appeared.

577
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,406
And in addition - mine.

578
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:49,147
Anna. Say it to me.
I'm beging you...

579
00:52:49,564 --> 00:52:51,460
Tell me he's mine.

580
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:54,241
Please, don't be crazy.

581
00:52:57,616 --> 00:53:00,439
I hoped I wouldn't meet you again.

582
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:07,153
If somebody is in my way today,
I'll put him in the sack and I'll throw itto the river!

583
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:15,744
You can guess, you can count,
but you don't have a proof that Vašek is yours.

584
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:16,581
I do.

585
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:22,151
He's as great as me!

586
00:54:04,149 --> 00:54:05,453
Where were you running?

587
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,703
To a train station. Luboš is coming today!

588
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,527
Which Luboš?

589
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:09,692
My daddy!

590
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:10,711
A spare one.

591
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:13,640
So mum found somebody?

592
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,884
No. I found him by myself!

593
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:17,736
He wrote 9 letters to him!

594
00:54:19,012 --> 00:54:20,325
What is he like?

595
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:23,956
A big one. A chief of a mountain rescue.

596
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:32,592
Mum has a first general rehearsal.
We should wait outside.

597
00:54:33,157 --> 00:54:34,498
Let's go inside then!

598
00:54:48,297 --> 00:54:49,685
This is mum?

599
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:54,334
Damn it, she's great.

600
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,556
We're going to sleep in one room.

601
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:29,814
And who's the guy?

602
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:32,697
Uncle Jindrich.

603
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:50,910
I don't like him!
He's not confident and doesn't like dogs.

604
00:55:55,643 --> 00:56:00,090
Then we'll put him in the sack
and we'll throw him into the river.

605
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,376
Enough!

606
00:56:04,852 --> 00:56:06,051
This is Annapurna.

607
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,195
And up there?

608
00:56:07,556 --> 00:56:09,842
Also Annapurna. Also Annapurna.

609
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:14,956
I screwed this one. This was in december.
This was when I was 5.

610
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:17,988
And why is there a christmas tree and those presents?

611
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:21,885
For ym daddy of course.
To bring him company.

612
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,814
-I'll take you with me.
-Really?

613
00:56:33,258 --> 00:56:34,483
When you are adult.

614
00:56:35,554 --> 00:56:38,025
-Do you have that photo?
It's hidden.

615
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,772
Then show it to me.

616
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:50,506
I don't want mummy to steal it.

617
00:56:58,435 --> 00:57:00,056
Let me guess, will you?

618
00:57:05,312 --> 00:57:06,655
Am I right?

619
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,292
You knew my daddy?

620
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,096
Are you able to be silent?

621
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:13,180
In front of your mum?

622
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,515
This is me.

623
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,070
It's not you! It's my dad!

624
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:24,709
It's your dad, but it's also me!

625
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:25,850
What does it mean?

626
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,142
I don't know!

627
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:30,731
That I'm your dad.

628
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,760
That's not true!

629
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,224
It's not you! It's my dad!

630
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,932
Why couldn't it be me?

631
00:57:36,932 --> 00:57:39,672
My dad is dead! A hero!

632
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,054
What are you doing here?

633
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:42,388
Luboš is lying.

634
00:57:42,842 --> 00:57:47,410
Anna, please, don't be mad with me.
I told Vašek.

635
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:52,598
You are egotistical.
Idiot.

636
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,308
Do you have a knife?

637
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:07,435
I've been collecting these cars for 5 years.

638
00:58:10,248 --> 00:58:14,096
All of them are yours now.

639
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,141
You can't take him serious, mum.
He's a babbler.

640
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:32,665
And don't swear at him.
He's going to have dinner with us.

641
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:36,125
I'll help you.

642
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,571
Me too.

643
00:58:49,462 --> 00:58:52,509
Mummy, how so Luboš knew my dad?

644
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:55,609
I didn't know him.

645
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:57,158
Why is he lying?

646
00:58:57,158 --> 00:59:02,760
You pointed at him.
Were you his friend?

647
00:59:06,124 --> 00:59:07,860
I don't know.

648
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:12,211
But I know!
You left him under a snowslip!

649
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:14,032
Damn it!

650
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:17,238
Say something, Anna.

651
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:22,100
Leave me alone. Both of you.

652
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,187
I'll tell you something.

653
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:33,687
If my dad was allive, he would be
at home with me every evening.

654
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,746
He would go to the cinema with me.

655
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:38,726
And we would have a dog.

656
00:59:38,726 --> 00:59:41,698
But your dad didn't know
that you exist.

657
00:59:41,698 --> 00:59:43,023
If he knew, he would visit you.

658
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:48,042
And why didn't he visit mum?
He knew she exists.

659
00:59:48,737 --> 00:59:51,336
Mum, is he my dad?

660
00:59:53,996 --> 00:59:58,172
Is he or not?
I want to know it!

661
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,544
Yes, this is your dad.

662
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:14,031
You screwed it. Everything.

663
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:19,423
Let mum be! Go away!

664
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:36,941
Mummy, don't cry.

665
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:39,256
He's already away.

666
01:00:40,062 --> 01:00:43,231
You've got me. I'm going to be with you.

667
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:46,199
Until we die. Every day.

668
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:15,347
Look, my dad is as exact as a clock.

669
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:28,550
Your mother called.

670
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,829
She made a meeting with me.

671
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:33,451
Tomorrow.

672
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:36,180
Don't you know, what she wants to tell me?

673
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,693
I can imagine that. To make you get divorced.

674
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:40,925
And you don't want to?

675
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:47,240
I haven't been wishing anything else for 4 years.

676
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:55,284
Maybe it would be worth it.
To talk about us.

677
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:01,951
You should meet Vašek. Not me.

678
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,040
I've been waiting in fornt of the school for 1 hour.

679
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:05,722
So?

680
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:11,077
Nothing.

681
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,311
Why didn't you listen to me?

682
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:17,090
I knew Vašek would never understand.

683
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:20,691
Can I visit you?

684
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:24,119
At 4? At 5?

685
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,249
You aren't interested in who was it??

686
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,786
I'll come in the evening.

687
01:02:30,035 --> 01:02:31,973
I don't even know you!

688
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:34,422
You don't know anything about me either...

689
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,356
And you made Vašek think we're going to live together.

690
01:02:36,948 --> 01:02:38,030
I'm afraid he doesn't want to talk to me.

691
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,221
You could have written a letter.

692
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,152
I read about your return from Himalayas
in the newspapers.

693
01:02:45,164 --> 01:02:47,028
Why didn't you write you were pregnant?

694
01:02:47,317 --> 01:02:50,446
Where? To Asia?
Camp number 4?

695
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,999
I returned.

696
01:02:52,865 --> 01:02:55,448
The boy was nearly 3 months.

697
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:57,929
Why did you want Vašek to never know me?

698
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:02,240
What did I do to you?

699
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:12,305
I... I was kind of proud to be pregnant with you.

700
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,743
I thought you were hero, when
you rescued that man in Obøí dùl.

701
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:28,613
I thought...
I thought you were going to be happy when you return.

702
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:31,432
That I'm as brave as you.

703
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:34,713
That I kept the baby.

704
01:03:39,474 --> 01:03:43,288
But if you wrote the boy was born...

705
01:03:44,145 --> 01:03:50,633
You didn't even recall me
and you'd be so happy to have a baby.

706
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,346
When are you leaving?

707
01:03:56,495 --> 01:03:58,318
In 4 days.

708
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:05,703
Vašek needs time to get over it.

709
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:11,587
If children could understand everything,
they wouldn't be children.

710
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:19,612
Because there are more differences between children
and adults, not only that children are small and adults are big.

711
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:22,118
It was also my fault.

712
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:23,726
It wasn't.

713
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:29,886
Vašík, did you want a dad? You did.

714
01:04:30,175 --> 01:04:34,254
You liked Luboš.
You said he was a friend.

715
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:40,031
He is not, mum.
I cried for him while he was in the mountains with foreign friends.

716
01:04:40,031 --> 01:04:43,040
Luboš didn't know about you.
You must trust me!

717
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,430
He cheated me.
He lied to me in the mountains already.

718
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:50,047
He pretended to try dating you,
and you got married a long time ago.

719
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,573
We didn't.

720
01:04:54,101 --> 01:04:58,589
When I was young, I trusted you
that you bought me in a shop.

721
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:02,221
But now I'm old enough to know
how babies are born.

722
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:03,230
Really?

723
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:05,463
After marriage.

724
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:14,388
Well... Marriage isn't the main thing.

725
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:16,209
It can happen when people love each other.

726
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:23,951
If he loved you, mum,
he would visit us on saturday or when it's my birthday.

727
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,791
You are stubborn just like your little tooth.

728
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,967
We've been persuading it for 2 hours
and it doesn't give in.

729
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,621
But when it grows up, it won't hurt anymore, will it?

730
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,913
Luboš will be waiting for you tomorrow in front of the school.

731
01:05:41,913 --> 01:05:44,283
I won't go there.

732
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:15,357
I told him.

733
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:17,301
I did what I could.

734
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:22,122
It depends on you.

735
01:06:23,132 --> 01:06:24,483
I'm going to gargle.

736
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:32,659
Vašík, you are a goon. Such beautiful pictures...
Why did you destroy them?

737
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:35,150
I won't be a claimber anymore.

738
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:25,806
You've got prima bike. You are good at it.

739
01:07:26,812 --> 01:07:34,765
I've bought new equipment.
I have it in hotel. Don't you want to have a look?

740
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,325
I've brought you something.

741
01:07:48,206 --> 01:07:49,276
Do you like him?

742
01:07:49,276 --> 01:07:50,821
I'm not allowed to bring foreign dogs.

743
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:54,718
He's not a foreign dog. He's Ben.
Keep him. He's yours.

744
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:57,823
And what about mum? Won't she beat me?

745
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,159
Don't worry. She'll be happy.

746
01:08:00,472 --> 01:08:03,280
You're lying! And you're teaching mum to lie.

747
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:07,792
You talk about me via phone.

748
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:33,565
I let you go to the mountains not to loose you
and there you forgot me in one day.

749
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,070
It's quite funny actually.

750
01:08:40,775 --> 01:08:45,326
When a man is afraid, he's about to loose.

751
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:28,855
You really want to go to a hospital?

752
01:09:28,855 --> 01:09:33,058
No. Your mother invited me in your place.

753
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:37,289
I would have to know that, wouldn't I?

754
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:38,857
You won't invite me upstairs?

755
01:09:43,043 --> 01:09:46,010
You shouldn't have gone with me.

756
01:09:57,043 --> 01:10:01,436
Anna, would you mind Vašek having a dog?

757
01:10:04,187 --> 01:10:05,876
No way.

758
01:10:06,213 --> 01:10:10,813
That's a disaster...
Don't worry! I'll fix it!

759
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:16,148
Leave me alone. Both of you!

760
01:10:26,546 --> 01:10:27,338
Where is he?

761
01:10:27,595 --> 01:10:29,379
Who? Vašek or that dog?

762
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:31,918
Jindrich of course!

763
01:10:39,598 --> 01:10:44,751
You went crazy.
All of you.

764
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:54,740
Mummy, are you glad that we have Beník?

765
01:10:55,052 --> 01:10:56,565
Of course.

766
01:10:57,222 --> 01:10:59,334
Go to wash. Don't play.

767
01:10:59,383 --> 01:11:02,079
Come, Beník, we'll make a beautiful dog out of you.

768
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:06,688
Luboš has a dad in Kamenice. They have rabbits.

769
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:12,096
Also a cat. A pig.
You would have a grandpa.

770
01:11:13,205 --> 01:11:15,388
You always wished a grandpa, didn't you?

771
01:11:17,162 --> 01:11:20,599
Enough. Everybody can screw something nice.

772
01:11:20,937 --> 01:11:24,843
Also me or Luboš. But you're a prima boy.

773
01:11:24,843 --> 01:11:28,299
And it was quite good idea with those toothbrushes!

774
01:11:29,234 --> 01:11:34,714
-There should be 3 people in every family.
-We are 3. You, me and a dog.

775
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:01,208
What's up?

776
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,407
Today I've been waiting for 2 hours.

777
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:08,367
I can't make Vašek talk to you.

778
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,034
He didn't even show up.
He's more faithless than a mountain.

779
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:18,977
Anna, I'll wont make it...

780
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,822
Vašek was waiting for you for 8 years
and you give it up in several days?

781
01:12:22,822 --> 01:12:24,550
But I'm leaving tomorrow!

782
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,040
What if you didn't go to the mountains?

783
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,280
I can't leave my friends.

784
01:12:31,617 --> 01:12:34,072
You're just like a snowslip.

785
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:36,409
You made me a grave, Anna!
I wouldn't make that...

786
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:41,009
I wouldn't make to read in the newspaper
that somebody is allive and make him funural.

787
01:12:41,009 --> 01:12:44,234
And what was I supposed to tell Vašek,
when he started asking about dad?

788
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:48,521
You waited for me 1 more year,
before he'd sterted talking?

789
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,440
3 more years,
before he'd started thinking.

790
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:56,774
If there was an idiot in this world,
it was me.

791
01:12:56,774 --> 01:12:59,545
You don't need to apologize.
I don't care about you today.

792
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:04,715
Don't say that...
There's our 8 years old boy to be stubborn.

793
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,419
Aniczka, you must go!

794
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,123
Moment, moment.
Wednesday is a visit day.

795
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:25,356
There's my wife here.

796
01:13:29,619 --> 01:13:30,899
Vašek's got lost.

797
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:32,148
What are you making up?

798
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:35,569
When I rang and told him about your broken leg,
he just went crazy.

799
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,535
Before I packed your stuff up,
he was gone.

800
01:13:38,535 --> 01:13:40,456
I've been looking for him for an hour.

801
01:13:40,456 --> 01:13:43,107
Please, don't panic,
now he's already at home.

802
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:44,891
He's been already here?

803
01:13:46,604 --> 01:13:50,219
There are many hospitals in Praha
and he found the right one.

804
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,752
We have a clever child, don't we?

805
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:56,739
Why is she staring at us?

806
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,627
She's my mother.

807
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:05,819
Look after his homework
and put the keys into the mailbox before you leave.

808
01:14:07,578 --> 01:14:08,873
Go.

809
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:20,841
What a behaviour! So you have a child together?!
Then explain to me...

810
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,481
He was that rascal??

811
01:14:26,225 --> 01:14:30,073
If they don't make peace, I will die...

812
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,794
Why didn't you tell me about having grandma in a hospital?

813
01:14:52,967 --> 01:14:56,030
Can you imagine how frightened I was?

814
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:39,213
I'll spend the night here.

815
01:15:39,638 --> 01:15:42,277
You don't have to go to Valentas.

816
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:18,168
I couldn't come today.

817
01:16:18,505 --> 01:16:19,887
Why?

818
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:21,232
I had a punishment.

819
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:23,473
A bummer, isn't it?

820
01:16:23,473 --> 01:16:26,081
Mum has to go to school.

821
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:26,962
And why?

822
01:16:27,579 --> 01:16:29,347
I didn't want to write an essay.

823
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:33,660
You know what?
I'll go to school instead of mummy.

824
01:16:33,974 --> 01:16:36,012
But you are leaving tomorrow.

825
01:16:36,269 --> 01:16:37,523
I'll stay here with you.

826
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:38,220
You'll go.

827
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:44,637
I'll arange it with mum.
Girls don't know anything about friendship.

828
01:16:44,902 --> 01:16:46,262
And you do?

829
01:16:46,262 --> 01:16:47,551
I do.

830
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:51,039
I've already written that essay.

831
01:16:52,536 --> 01:16:53,671
What does my dad do?

832
01:16:54,183 --> 01:17:00,423
My dad is a chief of Mountain rescue. He does what he says.
He waits for me in front of the school at 3 o'clock.

833
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:03,979
He's reliable. He bought me a dog.

834
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:09,356
He's got experience because he¨s a claimber.
He claimbed a 8000m high mountain.

835
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:12,438
He gets over all obsticles.

836
01:17:12,438 --> 01:17:15,359
He's a good friend.

837
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,612
Do you know how to pull a tooth to a kangaroo?

838
01:17:27,133 --> 01:17:31,341
You make a sea crane, you prepare dynamit...

839
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,941
It wasn't a kangaroo, it was a whale!

840
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:34,966
That's not important.

841
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:39,623
It is! Because you have to give dynamit to a whale.
Kangaroo would visit a dentist.

842
01:17:39,968 --> 01:17:43,128
3, 2, 1!
