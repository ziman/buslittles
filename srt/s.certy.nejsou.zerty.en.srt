GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,238
Once upon a time

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,072
there was a kingdom

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,109
and in it a mill

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,192
wherein ruled Macha the miller,
a just and diligent man.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,357
They had a fine son named Peter.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,355
They'd have led a happy life

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,476
had it not been for...

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,593
...one kingdom thinking
the other better off...

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,116
...and this being
why the first was worse off...

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,075
whilst the third kingdom...

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,118
Based on the story by
Screenplay, Dramaturge

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,749
...was waiting for...

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,638
the first two to fight it out...

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,995

English sub-titles by Doris Koziskova

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,437
As if they'd all taken leave of their
senses.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,993
For ten years the small kingdoms were
at war.

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,356
Peter grew into an upright young man.
But his father was losing his strenght,

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,079
grieving for the good wife he had lost.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,635
Steward...

45
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,880
You maintained war
would make our fortune.

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,632
Where is that fortune?

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,269
To make it we'd have needed 5,000 ducats

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,272
for an army-to win!

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,999
Why did you make war then?

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,514
I keep you,
to keep track of these things!

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,591
It's no fun ruling.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,432
I like hunting!

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,432
After your wars there isn't a partridge
in my woods.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,478
If we set up an army.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,120
I'd need 5,000.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,636
You've gone mad.
Damn it, where are my...

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,678
Keys?

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,638
Keys!

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,751
Good morning.
- Good morning.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,195
Don't you know
where my cash-box keys are?

61
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,713
Adela!
- No, Pappa.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,751
Angelina?
- Oh, Pappa.

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,308
Where can they be?

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,428
Adela!

65
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,557
But this is where you usually put them!
- Here!

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,837
I never put it there.
- There?

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,678
Here!
- There!

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,554
That's all...

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,395
AII? ...our cash.
- You promised me a new dress!

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,956
The steward needs money a new army.
- 5,000.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,315
Adela never moans about new dresses.

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,473
Because I give her mine
and then have nothing to wear.

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,279
Let go,
this is State money.

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,797
Don't cry, Angelina,

75
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,030
this dress is good enough for me.
- Shut up, you goose.

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,868
I'll never get married this way.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,595
Must I do it all myself, you lazybones?

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,718
You're such a help, my boy.

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,996
Ah, the steward...

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,469
Go watch your pots.
- We are honoured.

81
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,236
Have you thought of getting married,
Dorothy?

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,071
The man in my heart

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,958
would hardly choose me.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,954
How about Machal the miller?

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,995
Machal?

86
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,355
That old geezer?

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,797
I thought you were more cunning.
If a bright young woman married him

88
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,714
the mill could soon hers.

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,791
But he's got a son.

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,030
That can be arranged.

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,315
Where did that cat come from?

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,277
In the kitchen?

93
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,149
Good morning, neighbour!

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,311
Good morning.

95
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,831
Dear God, what a mess!
I was passing by,

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
something's burning,
would you like some help?

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,432
Thank you.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,152
This is a woman's job.

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,513
There, aren't they lovely.

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,636
Help yourselves!
There's lots!

101
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,397
In a matter of weeks -
they were married.

102
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,953
If an old man wants to play the fool,

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,829
he marries a young woman.

104
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,356
For this we'll buy the field by the
pond.

105
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,112
The mill's enough, Dorothy,
a field would mean more work still!

106
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,311
But Frankie, you're so strong!

107
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,995
Surely you don't feel old?

108
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,310
Of course not.

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,876
Mind you don't burn it.

110
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,594
Haven't you got a good wife?

111
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,832
I have.

112
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,478
Others would spend it all on clothes.

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,673
Why did you let the men go?

114
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,833
Whoever heard of two men doing all
the work?

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,033
You do nothing but lazy around.
We have no money to waste!

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,399
Dad, say something!

117
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,509
Dorothy is right, Peter.
We'll manage.

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,719
Frankie!
There's a dance on tonight.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,668
You haven't forgotten, have you?

120
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,910
But Dorothy, I'm...
- Or do I go by myself?

121
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,836
No, Dorothy, no.

122
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,913
And now a gavotte!

123
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,792
Let's sit his out.

124
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,189
D'you want me to dance
with someone else?

125
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,157
No.
- Well then!

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,711
Faster!

127
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,277
Frankie!

128
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,111
Poor unhappy me.
What'll I do without him?!

129
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,354
Once upon a time there was Hell.

130
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,588
There they had a pair of scales,
not to weigh people's pounds

131
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,237
but their sins.

132
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,275
There was no cheating it.

133
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,149
Stop!

134
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,238
Stand still and give me a report!

135
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,949
Your Majesty, King of the Darkness,
Lucifer XIV.

136
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,429
I bear fresh news of Dorothy Machal.

137
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,114
Wait!

138
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,795
Where is the Book of Sins?
- It should have been here!

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,439
Her cup of sins has overflowed.

140
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,476
Here's the Book.
- Scram!

141
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,357
Come here!

142
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,670
You left your post?!

143
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,671
The Bat has taken over!
- Quiet!

144
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,793
I thought...
- Silence!

145
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,991
Scram!

146
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,472
Dorothy Machal, page 1027,

147
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,949
line eight.
- I can see.

148
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,436
Line eight...

149
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,795
So I see.
I look-and see!

150
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,996
Yes, here.

151
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,075
You impertinent devil.

152
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,636
What do I see?

153
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,990
What do we see?

154
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,476
Stand still!
Don't move!

155
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,235
I said don't move!

156
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,198
That's my boot.

157
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,794
That was your boot.

158
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,791
A feather.
Where did it come from?

159
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,509
Come here, Cat!

160
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,315
Here, come on!

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,636
Let's see your teeth!

162
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,075
Teeth!

163
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,671
Your hands!

164
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,555
The other one!

165
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,391
It hurts!

166
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,429
All devils-line up!

167
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,311
No!

168
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,516
Come here!

169
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,473
A chicken!
All change back!

170
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,835
Your hand!
What is that?!

171
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,515
What is that?!

172
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,591
I was so terribly hungry!

173
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,992
I'll show you, wanting meat.

174
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,834
I hereby degrade you to rabbit!

175
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,632
That was one single feather!

176
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,833
Were it not for my intervention...

177
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,510
the Book of Sins'd have been destroyed!

178
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,195
So was my advice good, Dorothy?

179
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,635
Very good.
Do help yourself,

180
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,598
we're not stingy like at the castle.

181
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,036
Yes.
How pretty you are today, Dorothy.

182
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,352
A young one.

183
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,756
Tender?

184
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,515
I hurried over
to tell you -

185
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,909
how sorry I am.

186
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,197
You didn't even know my father.

187
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,914
Go and mend the roof, it's leaking.

188
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,430
Did you hear me?

189
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,391
The lazy lout.

190
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,792
Get down at once!
Take that of the chimney!

191
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,111
I am mending the roof

192
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,191
as you told me to.

193
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,679
Did you hear me?

194
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,877
Climb down at once,
you young rascal!

195
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,117
At once!

196
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,235
You're right.

197
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,552
I'm going.

198
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,393
No.

199
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,517
You dropped something.

200
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,637
Help me, woman.
What is this?

201
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,073
It smells horrid.

202
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,311
Where're you going?
You haven't chopped the wood yet!

203
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,152
Let the steward chop it for you!

204
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,118
I'll be back when you're gone!

205
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,670
This will cost you dear!

206
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,829
You lot her cheat you out of everything?

207
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,715
Where's your common sense?

208
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,951
I didn't leave everything.
Look!

209
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,269
My mother's.
The ring I'll give my bride one day.

210
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,192
Peek-a-boo!
I've got the warrant for arrest

211
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,199
for that stepson of yours.

212
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,076
When his Majesty signs it

213
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,869
the mill will soon be ours.
I mean yours.

214
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,954
A life sentence.
- A life sentence.

215
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,956
Good!
- Isn't it?

216
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,838
But it'll cost something.

217
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,070
No, no.

218
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,034
There was no need for that.
Put you'll need some for his Majesty,

219
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,680
He's so money-minded.

220
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,231
Angeline!

221
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,438
Come on!

222
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,875
Wait!

223
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,911
Wait for me!

224
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,912
Caught you!

225
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,709
Look what you've done!
Torn my only dress!

226
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,519
I'm sorry, Angelina.
Forgive me.

227
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,795
Come on!
- We can darn it!

228
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,757
No we can't.

229
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,629
I am willing to ignore

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,950
that he wanted to kill me,

231
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,318
but he robbed his mother,
that sadly berieved widow,

232
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,190
and he up and left her

233
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,838
with the whole mill to look after!

234
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,753
What do I do?
I didn't bring up her son!

235
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,195
No, your Majesty!

236
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,794
You could jail him.

237
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,555
He is an incredibly dangerous man.

238
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,437
Look, come back some other time.

239
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm busy right now.

240
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,914
So he's a naughty boy?

241
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,792
I'm a helpless woman,

242
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,758
I'm afraid of him!

243
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,957
You're telling me,
children are a worry.

244
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,798
Yes.

245
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,279
Here.

246
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,794
Pappa, now you'll admit

247
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,553
that I need a new dress!

248
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,437
Here.

249
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,158
What has Petr Machal done,
that you want him jailed?

250
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,595
Children...
- May I?

251
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,552
There.

252
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,599
Would your Majesty take up the pen

253
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,070
and sign here, please.

254
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,550
Sign up, Pappa!

255
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,914
After you've ascertained

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,151
who's in the right!
- Oh, come on.

257
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,999
Right indeed.

258
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,040
Yes.

259
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,036
Joseph the Handsome.

260
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,070
I didn't hear you say good day.

261
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,150
On his Majesty's decision
you are under arrest.

262
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,478
No.

263
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,636
Arrested?
Why?

264
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,560
They'll explain at the castle.

265
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,958
Come on!

266
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,550
Go away!

267
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,796
Come on up!

268
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,440
You'll pay for this.

269
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,114
My best to his Majesty.

270
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,193
You must run.

271
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,999
Why?
I haven't done anything.

272
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,039
How can you rebel against the masters?
You must always stay in their good books

273
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,509
if you want to live in contentment.

274
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,797
I want to live in contentment, Grandma.
But here.

275
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,154
What's this?
Open the door!

276
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,840
Is there anything wrong?

277
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,913
Search the place!
quickly!

278
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,238
quick!

279
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,195
Open everything up!

280
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,748
Look properly!

281
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,628
Search everything thoroughly!

282
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,154
He has to be here somewhere!

283
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,117
He isn't here.
- He isn't?

284
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,036
Take her to the castle!
She'll be jailed instead of Peter!

285
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,918
Let her go!

286
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,719
Give in, Machal!

287
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,477
Catch him!

288
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,031
Here!

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,711
Catch!

290
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,829
Well, come on!
Come on, then!

291
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,474
Watcher rolling about for?
Where is he?

292
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,869
I'll catch him myself.

293
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,996
Machal, halt!

294
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,551
Help!

295
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,790
Help us!

296
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,152
Bravo, young man!
You've saved us.

297
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,910
Tell me,
where did you learn to ride so well?

298
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,479
We could have been killed.

299
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,636
Thank you.

300
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,233
Thank you.

301
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,311
Tie him up!

302
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,151
quickly!

303
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,556
Come on!
Let's go.

304
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,835
Wait!
But he saved our lives!

305
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,388
Sorry, here's the warrant.
Take him away.

306
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,472
But that's unjust.
Angelina!

307
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,114
We thank you, Peter!

308
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,071
Don't mention it.
- Go!

309
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,633
On the other hand it was he
who made our horses shy off!

310
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,635
Bravo!
Bravissimo!

311
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,473
And now draw up a deed

312
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,074
that the whole mill is mine.

313
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640
Dorothy Machal...
here.

314
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,393
It is high time
to bring Dorothy Machal down to Hell.

315
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,434
Who volunteers?

316
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,197
The first were Horse and Goat.

317
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,677
Make your choice!

318
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,710
A map of the village
a description of Dorothy Machal.

319
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,918
Watch out for feathers
and no alcohol!

320
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,358
Peter!

321
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,316
It's you.

322
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,513
I've brought some food.

323
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,597
Thanks.

324
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,789
Tomorrow they'll judge you.
Don't argue with father.

325
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,074
He's not a bad man,

326
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,720
but he doesn't like quarrelsome people.

327
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,117
Will your sister be there?

328
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,510
Angelina'll be there.

329
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
And what's your name?
- Adela.

330
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,355
I'll have to go.

331
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,830
'Bye,
and thanks, Adela.

332
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,910
Ripple softly,

333
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,750
sweet breeze

334
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,909
cool my hot brow

335
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,957
and stop it aching.

336
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,429
Cool my hot brow

337
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,511
and stop it aching.

338
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,990
Call him gently, my Peter

339
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,273
tell him that we two are made
for each other.

340
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,953
Tell him that we two are made
for each other.

341
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,432
Is that you, Angelina?
I knew you'd come.

342
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,353
Answer me, Angelina!

343
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,075
I only wanted to see you.

344
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,879
It wouldn't kill you to go and see him.

345
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,834
He thinks of nothing but you.
- Such a pauper, and in jail?!

346
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,639
No good to me at all.

347
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,676
They'll be judging him tomorrow.

348
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,832
Do talk to father,
he heeds your words.

349
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,560
Do you know this rock?

350
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,631
That's Devil's Rock.
- Let's climb up.

351
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,390
One shouldn't play around with
such things.

352
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,550
You're such a baby!

353
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,272
Adela!

354
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,157
Angelina!

355
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,151
Catch me!

356
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,228
Wait for me!

357
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,032
Adela, come quickly!

358
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,635
How dare you? You thief!

359
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,958
Forgive me ladies, I'm so hungry

360
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,031
and when I saw this snack?

361
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,317
That was our food for the whole day!

362
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,595
I'll have you locked up!

363
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,837
Thanks for the hospitality, ladies.

364
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,752
Where did you get this?

365
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,155
The ducats are real.

366
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,593
He was very odd.

367
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,877
I told you to keep away
from Devil's Rock.

368
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,918
I'll believe in devils when I see one!

369
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,758
Away with you!

370
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,790
Dash it, feathers!

371
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,469
A lovely day today!

372
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,551
Help!

373
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,278
What happened, Ma'am?

374
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,552
Nothing.
Just a bang in the stove.

375
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,439
You have a visitor.
- Who?

376
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,990
I'm no visitor.
This is more my home than yours.

377
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,876
What do you want?
- I came because of Peter.

378
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,516
It's that steward, not me!

379
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,590
I love Peter!

380
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,318
But...
- I need him here.

381
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,028
Tomorrow I'll go to the castle
and beg them to let him go.

382
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,432
I'll go now.

383
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,952
Would you watch my tarts

384
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,837
so they don't burn?

385
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,150
I'll be right back.

386
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,311
And that's that.
The old cow.

387
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,431
Take those weights off.
You inefficient fools!

388
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,356
Can someone explain
what this is about?

389
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,477
I'd like to know too.
The deuce!

390
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,990
It's not dropping?!

391
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,117
Are you Mrs Machal?

392
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,391
That I am.

393
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,990
Let's see!

394
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,591
Where is it?
- Here.

395
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,873
Are you Dorothy Machal?

396
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,633
Oh no!

397
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,512
I'm Anna Machal.
Peter's grandmother, not stepmother.

398
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,955
Horse, come here!
Here!

399
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,557
You are degraded from the rank of Horse!

400
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,757
Come for your wolf's tail tomorrow.

401
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,558
Scram!

402
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,393
Take her down!

403
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,189
What the devil do we do with her?

404
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,952
What now?

405
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,557
You brought me here,

406
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,038
you can take me back again.

407
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,076
Definitely not.
- No.

408
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,754
Hell has its rules.

409
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,309
Exactly.

410
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,108
What Hell has claimed its own

411
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,112
must not Earth bemoan!

412
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,195
Unless Mrs Machal were willing
to work off Horse's mistake here.

413
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,270
What choice do I have.
At least it's nice and warm here.

414
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,634
He stole this jewel-box
from his poor stepmother

415
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,314
and then fled.

416
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,273
That's not true!
They are my things!

417
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,511
My real mother gave them to me!

418
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,636
They're my jewels, he stole them!

419
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,837
Why would he have fled otherwise?

420
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,195
After all my loving care!

421
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,590
He is a rebel!
He wounded three soldiers,

422
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,913
bruised two...

423
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,954
and made a fool of one.

424
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,558
I didn't steal anything!
Ask my grandmother whose they are.

425
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,996
Why is she not here?

426
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,628
The devil carried her off!
I saw it with my own eyes.

427
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,439
You see, what a family.

428
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,478
Hell is never wrong,

429
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,478
I suggest a life sentence.

430
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,876
Life?

431
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,754
Till the end of his life?

432
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,591
Yes, your Majesty,
I suggest a life sentence.

433
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,035
Angelina, say something.

434
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,390
And confiscated property.
Justice is justice.

435
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,953
I don't know what he's guilty of,
but he saved our lives

436
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,828
when he stopped the runaway horses.

437
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,708
When he fled from justice, you mean.

438
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,588
Angelina'll tell you about it.

439
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,433
Speak up, we're waiting.

440
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,592
I don't know, Pappa.
I was too frightened.

441
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,315
But Angelina!
I request that he...

442
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,597
Stick him in the army, your Majesty!
For 10 years.

443
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,796
No!
Hold him!

444
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,750
I'll tame him.

445
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,750
Not long enough, for life!

446
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,956
12 years, then.

447
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,509
Your task is clear!
Bring Dorothy Machal

448
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,355
or don't come back!

449
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,548
Who volunteers?

450
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,473
What?
How dare you after all that!

451
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,795
Our object is making good use

452
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,917
of your mistake!

453
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,390
I thought...
- Silence!

454
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,316
And no thinking!
I'll turn you into a worm!

455
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,915
You too.
You need taking down a peg or two.

456
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,668
We're the ones to do the thinking.

457
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,919
Not you, scribe!

458
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,518
No!

459
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,593
Mr Lucifer, in your place
I'd send the one who botched it up.

460
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,230
He'll try all the harder.

461
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,269
I know this Johnny?

462
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,635
Yeah, some Johnny?

463
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,110
I've learnt a new trick.
Watch!

464
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,157
Only the Prince of Hell
may change his likeness!

465
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,435
Correct.

466
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,149
Naturally.
But costumes may be changed.

467
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,115
How hard Johnny's trying!

468
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,237
And he knows the place now,
he won't make another mistake.

469
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,518
Attention!

470
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,638
What for?

471
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,876
I'll show you what for!

472
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,429
Put that log down!

473
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,633
Call these buttons sewn on?

474
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,470
This one.

475
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,792
Stack' em up!

476
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,036
It's come down!
Stack' em up!

477
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,632
Halt!

478
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,999
Start building it up!

479
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,038
Come in!

480
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,956
How could I have lived without all this.

481
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,395
Shut your eyes, Dorothy.

482
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,198
Now?

483
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,588
He looked like...
- The devil.

484
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,998
Yes.

485
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,436
And he's scared of feathers!

486
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,995
Not for me, thanks.

487
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,035
This Finicky-Nick doesn't like our beer!

488
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,558
You don't like our beer?

489
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,152
It's good.

490
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,435
Say it's good didn't taste it.

491
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,796
Tasting means drinking, my boy!

492
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,752
All of it?
- AII!

493
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,311
And bring him another!

494
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,670
I bet we'll recruit 10 today!

495
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,830
Two bottles!
No, three!

496
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,957
Last time the wager was for four.

497
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,756
That was last time.

498
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,193
It's come down again.
Must be the wind.

499
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,390
Stack' em up!

500
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,955
And move it!

501
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,475
Come on, men.

502
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,714
Ah, for our lovely pub
ah, for their lovely grub,

503
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,792
the soup is so hot

504
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,114
the boor is with froth!

505
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,036
Pour out for the boys toe.

506
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,391
Here you are, boys.

507
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,959
Bring it here.

508
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,073
Sign it here.

509
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,516
Here.

510
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,711
There'll be not work in the army?

511
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,351
There's never work!

512
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,879
Nothing but parades and reviews-
and money!

513
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,436
I can't write.

514
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,590
Never mind, your thumb.

515
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,230
A great idea!

516
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,639
What's this?
Who put it here?

517
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,916
Who did it?
Whose stupid joke was it?

518
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,076
The deuce!
Get up!

519
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,558
Surprise!
Didn't expect me?

520
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,511
What are you wearing, you fool?
Out!

521
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,598
I thought...
- Don't think, shut up!

522
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,910
Where's your tail?

523
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,039
In my suit.
- In what suit?

524
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,309
The soldiers burnt it all!

525
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,631
By Satan, you let them burn your tail
and sign you up for the army!

526
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,834
From now on you're

527
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,075
an ordinary mortal!
Hell is shut for you forever!

528
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,836
Mercy!
Prince of Darkness,

529
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,676
I'll do anything to set it right!

530
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,112
Mercy!

531
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,908
I promise never to drink again!

532
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,111
Let me go!

533
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,839
I'm no soldier, I'm a devil!

534
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,160
I've come for a widow?!

535
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,432
A widow? A devil?

536
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,392
You wait!

537
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,433
Arms up!
One, two, three, four!

538
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,598
Arms down!
One, two, three, four!

539
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,598
Forward march!
One, two, three, four!

540
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,513
Halt!

541
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,233
Call that marching?
Your name and rank!

542
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,551
Devil of Horse rank, no Wolf.

543
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,318
What?
You dare make fun of me?

544
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,959
Down-up!

545
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,150
Down!

546
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,111
Up!
Down!

547
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,196
Up!
Down!

548
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,670
Come in to the garden.

549
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,557
Wait.

550
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,996
Down!
Up!

551
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,151
Down!
Up!

552
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,437
Arms at the ready!

553
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,470
That's rebellion!
Throw your weapon down!

554
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,876
What's that?

555
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,633
Machal, back in line!
What did I say?

556
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,755
Get back, Machal!

557
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,310
20 days' jail
and 50 lashings!

558
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,399
Come back!

559
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,032
Did you see that?

560
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,714
Peter must have a good heart.

561
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,951
You and your Peter.

562
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,072
Mine?

563
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,794
You know he wants you.
And you?

564
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,030
Exactly.
Men need tricking, you silly.

565
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,869
50 lashings.

566
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,231
They shout at you all day
make you roll in the mud.

567
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,836
And all because of that woman.

568
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,230
Surely you're not in love?

569
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,072
No fear.

570
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,596
I was to bring a bad widow to Hell.

571
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,157
Was it Dorothy Machal by any chance?

572
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,711
How do you know?

573
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,278
If anybody I know deserves hell,

574
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,591
it's my stepmother.

575
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,158
So you are Peter?

576
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,228
And you really are a devil.

577
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,234
I should say!

578
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,436
Oh, but I'm not any more.
I'd have to get my wolf's tail back.

579
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,311
A wolf's tail?

580
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,394
I can't go back to hell till I have it.

581
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,389
What do you mean, a wolf's tail?

582
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,358
I can't change back without it.

583
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,476
I don't get it.

584
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,474
Go clean out the stables.

585
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,430
Doesn't Princess Angelina

586
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,397
Iook lovely?

587
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,356
Our cash-box is empty,
the ceiling's coming down

588
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,876
and we hold balls for borrowed money.

589
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,196
Curtsy, Angelina!

590
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,475
To the green one.

591
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,671
It's all arranged.

592
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,671
Angelina, Curtsy.

593
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,116
Angelina will marry richest suitor,

594
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,790
we'll pay our debts and have some over.

595
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,119
Do you like any of them?

596
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,509
Whom do you like?

597
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,513
Who is the richest?

598
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,279
She says who is the richest?

599
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,874
Well, who is the richest?
- Who is??

600
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,918
quietly.
I'll find out.

601
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,276
Can it be a dead wolf's tail?

602
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,316
Sure,
how'd you out it off a live one?

603
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,439
I know of one.
But how to got out of the barracks.

604
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,632
Wait!

605
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,714
Ah, for our lovely pub
ah, for their lovely grub,

606
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,312
the soup is so hot

607
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,074
the boor is with froth!

608
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,636
What's happening?

609
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,791
What's should be?

610
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,518
Nothing?
- Nothing.

611
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,151
Sure?
- Sure.

612
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,238
I know now who's the richest.

613
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,039
I've investigated.

614
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,791
According to ancient custom
the Princess will throw a golden apple,

615
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,149
the man it stops by will become
her husband.

616
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,234
But that's not gold.

617
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,434
No, I shall gold it.

618
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,159
What if it rolls some Pauper?

619
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,390
Yes.
The ball is actually made of iron.

620
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,109
And this stone will make it stop

621
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,715
by the richest of the suitors.

622
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,278
Try pulling it away.

623
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,794
I can't.

624
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,790
I'll do it.

625
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,479
What is this stone?

626
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,917
It comes from Magnet Mountain

627
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,116
and attracts all iron objects.

628
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,709
I did say all iron objects.

629
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,910
Yes, but...

630
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,434
I'd prefer...

631
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,114
The army is important,

632
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,357
believe me.

633
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,752
Hello, officer!
What are you doing here?

634
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,358
How lovely you look, Princess.

635
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,954
And gallant, too.

636
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,952
But you haven't asked me dance yet!

637
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,836
Permit me to rectify my mistake.

638
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,352
For so long I've been wanting...
- Long?

639
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,670
I don't know you, you must be new.

640
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,910
Good evening, Peter.
- Good evening.

641
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,037
That's Machal, the young miller.

642
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,189
Where did you steal the uniform?
How dare you?

643
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,269
Guards!

644
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,555
Wait, Angelina!

645
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,995
Guards!

646
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,355
I only wanted to see you.

647
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,908
Catch him!

648
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,673
Hurry up!
Throw him in prison!

649
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,589
Peter!
Hide in here!

650
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,116
He ran this way!

651
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,758
Come on!

652
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,438
Thank you, Princess.
- Run!

653
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,436
Prince, do you want our Princess?

654
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,073
I'd give anything...

655
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,110
Put this in your shoe and she is yours.

656
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,554
According to ancient custom
the Princess's husband

657
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,516
will be chosen...
justly... by this golden apple.

658
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,629
He to whom it rolls will have her.

659
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,433
As his wife!

660
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,631
As his wife.

661
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,868
The apple.
Roll it towards the left.

662
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,036
No!

663
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,751
Help!

664
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,756
Pappa!

665
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,036
I'll tell my Pappa and
he'll declare war!

666
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,588
Congratulations, you won.

667
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,070
My Pappa will make war on you.
Carry him away.

668
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,113
Pappa'll make war!

669
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,957
Take this thing out of my shoe!

670
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,672
What thing?

671
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,432
We've been cheated!

672
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,239
Take my shoe off!

673
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,232
We want the money we lent you!

674
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,356
We've been tricked!
- Silence!

675
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,432
We'll declare war together!

676
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,950
Take my shoe off!
My Pappa'll make war on you!

677
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,911
Sure.

678
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,310
What will we do?

679
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,119
Luckily we have a strong army.

680
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,838
There's a parade tomorrow.

681
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,717
What?
- A parade.

682
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,834
We have a parade?

683
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,638
Come and see.
- I'll come.

684
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,668
Action stations!

685
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,148
Dammit-all-to-hell
I said action stations!

686
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,151
Sound the alarm!

687
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,756
Attention!
Where is your uniform, you stupid?

688
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,112
Attention!

689
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,036
Attention!
Attention!

690
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,032
This way.

691
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,669
Excuse me, where's the door.

692
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,592
Fire!

693
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,838
Come!

694
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,157
My dress!

695
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,989
Corporal!
Is this what you call a strong army?

696
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,037
Catch him!

697
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,995
Bring my horse!

698
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,634
Backwards again!

699
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,071
What?
- Turn me round!

700
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,311
Turn the horse round!
- Not the horse, me!

701
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,832
Wait.

702
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,598
Now.

703
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,550
Dorothy!
Dorothy!

704
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,149
Let me go!

705
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,150
Leave me alone!
Help!

706
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,511
Help!
No!

707
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,875
Follow them!
Encircle them!

708
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,195
quickly!

709
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,709
Everybody here!

710
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,591
Help!

711
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,318
Peter!

712
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,590
Give it to me.

713
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,636
Come on, Peter!

714
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,590
Follow them quickly!

715
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,995
We must get them!

716
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,072
How's that?

717
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,914
This doesn't load anywhere.
Dammit-all-to-hell!

718
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,791
You're ready for the gallows, Machal!

719
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,635
Hell's bells and cocker shells!

720
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,833
The gallows for you!

721
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,309
I snapped my sword!

722
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,833
My dear boy!

723
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,115
How happy I am to see you.

724
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,070
Good, she's sinking!

725
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,675
She's ours!

726
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,716
Take her!

727
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,950
She broke our scales.

728
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,712
Come here.

729
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,675
What do we do with him?

730
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,959
Leave me here for a few days.
They want to hang me.

731
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,071
Let go!

732
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,274
Take your hands away you hairy monster!

733
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,510
Help!

734
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,790
Let me go!

735
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,469
Don't touch me!

736
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,710
No,
help!

737
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,234
Help!
Help!

738
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,037
This is an ultimatum!
The ceiling's coming down.

739
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,556
Either I return their money within
the month

740
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,315
or they'll declare war.

741
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,349
Signed-all nine kingdoms.

742
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,437
Where am I to find the money?

743
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,840
How about selling the castle?

744
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,396
Are you mad?
Sell the roof over my head?

745
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,995
Actually, who'd buy the old ruin.

746
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,510
This castle was built
in the 12th century by my ancestors,

747
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,199
Ferdinand the Handsome and Josephine
the Mad.

748
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,278
Maybe I'd buy it off you,

749
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,234
to do you a favour.

750
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,590
The water strokes the pebbles

751
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,309
tenderly and softly
that is love.

752
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,069
Tenderly and softly
that is love.

753
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,875
Peter, dearest Peter,

754
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,200
who'll tell you that we two

755
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,558
are made for each other.

756
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,951
Get up!

757
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,795
The Devil never sleeps!

758
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,799
He did all this in a few days.

759
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,678
Leave that be and come here!

760
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,514
What do you think you're doing?
All this work down here?!

761
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,919
You'll spoil our reputation!

762
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,515
Make three wishes
and back to Earth with you!

763
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,357
One wish -
take me back home.

764
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,553
Of course, I will.
But what else?

765
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,030
Wait a minute.

766
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,832
Ask for this.

767
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,514
Such a scruffy old coat?
- It's magic.

768
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,232
He who wears it finds a ducat

769
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,436
in his pocket every time.

770
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,750
What is your wish?

771
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,876
To go back to Earth

772
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,713
to fetch the Corporal!

773
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,030
I'm coming with you.

774
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,476
All right.
You may take the coat.

775
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,276
And your grandmother.

776
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:41,031
I'll let Johnny go under the condition

777
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,832
that he brings the Corporal and
the Steward.

778
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,198
All right.
But won't they hang me?

779
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,876
With that coat on you are protected.

780
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,030
Put it on!

781
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,310
But don't forget -

782
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,870
when you take it off you lose all
powers.

783
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,276
May we go?

784
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,315
Let's see you.
Yes, you may!

785
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,077
Whom do we fetch first,
the Steward or the Corporal?

786
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,674
I'm going home to bake some cakes.

787
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,950
We're going to the pub.

788
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,598
Not even Lucifer
will get me to the pub.

789
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,558
That's where all my troubles began!

790
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,471
So I'll make the sacrifice and go.

791
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,438
You keep watch outside.
- You're great.

792
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,397
The devil!
The devil!

793
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,352
The devil!

794
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,435
How did they recognize you?
Me? Look at yourself!

795
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,912
Potato soup.

796
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,638
A full plate, please!

797
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,075
Pork with sauerkraut.
- Yes, Sir.

798
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,157
Goulash.

799
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,157
With bread.

800
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,595
And cream-cheese dumplings.

801
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,109
Right,
but can you pay?

802
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,431
Your servant, Milord -
at first sight I thought...

803
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,831
that you're...

804
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,589
What?

805
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,951
The devil!

806
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,076
Oh no.

807
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,720
I'm no devil.
I only look that way.

808
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,917
Take a seat,
it won't be long.

809
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,995
Take them.
They're yours.

810
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,836
Lots of money you say?

811
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,276
Must be a foreigner.

812
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,108
He's throwing ducats around.

813
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,117
Ducats?

814
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,634
He hands out as many as they ask for.

815
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,029
But Angelina.
- He must be mad.

816
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,071
See?
- Dress up as a pauper and go!

817
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,876
We can't miss such a chance!

818
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,311
82
- 82, thank you.

819
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,075
83
- 83, thank you.

820
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,038
84
- 84, thank you.

821
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,792
Come in!

822
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,116
Excuse me.

823
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,510
That's the Steward, you know!

824
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,713
I know.
I'll knock his feathered hat off.

825
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,916
And I'll catch him.

826
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,033
Where were we?
- 80

827
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,638
81
- 81

828
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,474
82
- 82

829
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,834
83
- 83

830
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,190
84

831
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,715
How dare you?

832
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,635
See this feather?
I have two, just in case!

833
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,834
Noble foreigner, you won't believe me

834
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,033
but I'm the poorest man around.

835
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,278
They all cheat me,
my children, the steward...

836
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,872
All I have but debts.

837
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,759
What would you like, your Majesty?

838
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,672
How can you know I'm...

839
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,753
Let's not play hide and seek.

840
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,308
How much do you need?

841
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,989
20,000 ducats.

842
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,909
All right,

843
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,074
but if you give me your daughter in
marriage.

844
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,390
30.000

845
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,188
I know it's a lot.

846
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,271
I don't understand.

847
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,477
I'm not scared, but I need help.

848
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,073
Help?

849
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,391
I have the feeling the devil
is after me.

850
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,553
The devil...

851
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,551
The devil.

852
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,719
I'll think of something.

853
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,677
Don't bother,

854
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,069
I've done that myself.

855
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,516
But I need a certain bunch of keys.

856
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,036
Keys?

857
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,354
I know the whereabouts of the steward
and corporal.

858
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,751
I heard them make arrangements.

859
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,478
But they've still got the feather.

860
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,437
Never mind.

861
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,718
Is the look dependable?

862
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,156
Sure,
it can be unlocked only from outside

863
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,556
and there stand the guards.
We are absolutely safe.

864
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,874
Come on, you...

865
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,516
Come here.

866
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,589
Come, little orphan,
join the others.

867
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,112
Here I am.
High time, too.

868
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,236
Corporal!

869
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,197
quickly.

870
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,030
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

871
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,630
Which way?

872
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,671
What a lot of money!

873
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,274
I'll have some.

874
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,470
Help!

875
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,277
Where are they?

876
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,510
Soldiers, attention!

877
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,956
There they are!

878
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,349
Not there, this way.

879
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,754
The secret passage to the castle!

880
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,788
I'll help you.

881
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,631
This way?
Run!

882
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,516
Climb out!

883
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,309
No feathers.
- On our hats!

884
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,550
Back to the chest!

885
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,676
quickly!
- This way!

886
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,390
I want to...

887
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,835
Wait here...

888
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,556
But Pappa...
- Who are you?

889
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,636
What are you doing here?

890
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,632
Come on!

891
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,395
Here we're safe.

892
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,952
And now we can disappear.

893
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,115
We're wasted in this stupid kingdom.

894
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,310
Thank you, Peter!

895
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,988
You'll have to marry him,
or he won't give us the money!

896
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,469
When he spruces up a bit...

897
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,155
I'm doing no such thing.
The Princess must marry me as I am.

898
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,037
I'll never marry such an eyesore!

899
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,838
Never!

900
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,474
Our debts!
Don't offend him.

901
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,949
I couldn't stand people seeing me
with such a fright!

902
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,794
As you like.
Goodbye.

903
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,828
Please, dear children!

904
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:39,118
There'd be war!

905
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,398
Get her to marry him, Pappa!

906
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,829
I'll keep my word.

907
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,033
My daughter will marry you.

908
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,348
She will sacrifice herself
for the Kingdom, for the family.

909
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,231
Au revoir.

910
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,792
Wait!

911
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,871
Poor little girl.

912
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,235
She'll get used to him.

913
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,197
One for us,
one for his Majesty.

914
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,118
One for us,
one for his Majesty.

915
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,632
Pull out another, Peter.

916
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,188
You'll need to renovate the mill.

917
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,471
One for us,
and one for us too.

918
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,917
And one each for luck.

919
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,198
Tomorrow we go to the castle.

920
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,630
I'm getting married.

921
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,469
Why are you doing that?

922
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,915
Thank you, Lucifer!

923
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,917
Who is it?
- Wait.

924
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,830
Yes, they're real.

925
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,952
I have come for my bride.

926
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,674
I'm marrying this one!

927
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,794
When I asked for your daughter,
I meant Adela.

928
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,997
This one?!

929
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,594
She's the one I'll marry.

930
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,669
Dear children.
I'll stay on the shelf?!

931
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,390
I'll think of something.

932
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,349
I want a husband now!

933
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,390
It's not fair!

934
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,040
Angelina, please?
- Excuse me.

935
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,031
May I have the pleasure?

936
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,231
With your permission.

937
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,553
Yes.

938
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:17,110
Angelina, a partner for you.

939
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,714
Interesting, passionate.

940
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,754
A good thing you didn't marry
that miller.

941
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,310
How about marrying a Prince?

942
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,748
Even the Prince of Hell?

943
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,991
Of course.
I don't believe in hell, you see.

944
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,675
In that case...

945
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,789
Lots of happiness.

946
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,513
Johnny!

947
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,318
Johnny!

948
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,438
But that's...
- She'll be fine.

949
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,358
Johnny!

950
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,711
I've got to go.

951
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,552
But...

952
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,518
Johnny!

953
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,398
Peter!

954
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,429
Hell may exist or not,
but it was a good idea.

955
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,558
If we look around us we see

956
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,235
that many people would be in need of it.

957
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,831
It isn't a good thing for people
to think

958
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,593
that evil can go unpunished.

959
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,315
I'm your love,

960
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,310
you are my love, too.

961
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,074
Why should we stay...

962
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,158
...why should we stay alone.

963
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,158
THE END
