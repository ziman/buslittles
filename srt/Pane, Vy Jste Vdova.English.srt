Processed at the Prague Film
Laboratories

21
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,736
Your Highness, the plane

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,812
with His Highness Oscar XV
is just landing.

23
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,859
- Do I give the impression
that I'm blind?

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,009
You seem incapable of cutting out
these monkey trick...

25
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,055
This impertinence mustn't get
into the papers!

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,017
See to it, Steiner!
- Yes, Sir.

27
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,418
Mind Out!

28
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,410
The kissing's over,
now come the handshakes.

29
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,098
General Oatis.

30
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,013
- But the Prime Minister and I
know each other.

31
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,691
- Gentlemen,...

32
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,339
But this is...

33
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,617
- Evelina Keletti
and her husband, the tycoon.

34
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,409
- Yes, of course I know you, I saw
your last film,

35
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,575
The Bath-Tub on the Terrace.

36
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,218
You played the title role, didn't you?

37
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,331
- Do you mean to maintain
that Madame Keletti played the bath-tub,

38
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,012
dear Cousin?

39
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,299
You two are Cousins?

40
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,610
- All men are brothers,

41
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,373
and all Kings are Cousins,
Madame Keletti.

42
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,416
- Oh, I see.

43
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,931
Present arms!

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,299
Sorry!

45
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,378
You and your monkey tricks!

46
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,052
This is the outcome...!

47
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,778
- Your Highness...
- Silence!

48
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,452
I have a great idea.
I shall abolish the army!

49
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,210
But Your Highness...
- Silence!

50
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,617
You are a public danger!

51
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,218
Today you crippled a man
and this is only a show.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,978
What would you be up to
if war broke out...

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,179
When did it happen?

54
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,811
- Seventeen minutes ago.

55
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,812
- I said size three and you hand me
you... head-in-the-clouds!

56
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,774
Take care I don't make you unemployed!

57
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,976
- Professor!
- Yes, Your Highness.

58
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,413
- Can one salute with this thing?

59
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,849
- Of course, and it even has
one great advantage:

60
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,419
no nerves!

61
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,817
Even should a mule kick you,
you wouldn't feel a thing!

62
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,453
- That's fine!

63
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,417
- Keep him amused!

64
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,215
The early morning edition,
Your Highness.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,456
- Rosebud IV is disbanding his army!

66
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,010
Oscar XV... and artificial hand made
by Professor Somer!

67
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,899
It's in the papers already!

68
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,618
- That's quite normal, Your Highness.

69
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,736
The "Tempo" always knows in advance
what's going to happen!

70
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,299
RUM

71
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,131
Stuart, the editor-in-chief wants
a horoscope made out

72
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,211
for that new singer,
is it ready yet?

73
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,899
- She's going to be terribly po...
popular next year.

74
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,494
- Surely not!
Is she such a talent then?

75
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,458
- No, but she'll be giving birth
to sextuplets!

76
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,852
Come in.

77
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,372
Bobo!

78
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,615
I s... say, man,
I haven't seen you f... for ages!

79
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,695
- Stuart, I got the sack.

80
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,417
- Well, ha... hacking off an arm...

81
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,737
- But I didn't do it on purpose!

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,177
- Wha... what can I do for you?

83
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,820
- Look here, please look
into those charts of yours,

84
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,212
about what's going to happen to me, see.
That's no problem for you, is it?!

85
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,534
- Well then, quick, your date of birth!

86
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,258
What have devised, Steiner?

87
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,370
- It's going to happen
tomorrow afternoon.

88
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,530
The lift cable's going to snap,
up on the fourth floor.

89
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,092
And the safety lock won't be working.

90
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,217
- There now, and no disbanding
of the army!

91
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,697
- I have worked out the time table

92
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,691
for the festive ceremony to inaugurate
the new government!

93
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,293
- We haven't won yet!

94
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,008
Some dreadful things have come out,
Bobo! Ah, now I understand!

95
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,536
I'm to be killed!
- And I?

96
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,017
- You're going to s... save my life!

97
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,892
- Me?
- Yes.

98
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,058
You'll take up your trade again.

99
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,219
But I keep butting into the picture.

100
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,251
This has got me flummoxed!

101
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,413
We're probably jo... joining forces!
- You and me? Together?

102
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,059
- Yeah. I'm to become a widow.

103
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,016
A widow twice over.

104
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,658
And then I'm to marry Molly.

105
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,776
- Molly Adams?
You mean to say you love her?

106
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,215
- Yes.
I'm to marry her

107
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,770
and... her husband too.

108
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,170
- You mean a sort of group-marriage?
We wouldn't get the permit!

109
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,570
- The stars don't lie, Bobo!

110
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,539
- Stuart, you're to report
at the Royal Palace immediately!

111
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,210
I don't believe in horoscope much,
but you sure hit it off with that hand.

112
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,099
I'm really curious,

113
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,210
after all, one doesn't abolish an army
more than once in a lifetime,

114
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,054
so I hope there won't be
any complications.

115
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,215
What will you have now, Mr. Hample?

116
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,933
Tea with rum.

117
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,011
Well, what have you worked out?
- I say, don't keep interrupting him!

118
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,658
- Now then, that's enough!

119
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,858
I've had enough of your incessant
rebukes!

120
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,535
What I really can't understand, Cousin,
is that how a man of your disposition

121
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,417
wants to disband his army!

122
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,058
You have a contentious temperament!

123
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,656
- You'd do better to mind
your own business! You hand's burning.

124
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,417
Damn it!

125
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,380
What do they make these things of?

126
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,656
- That's made of a foot.
- A foot?

127
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,652
- I stepped onto a red-hot poker once
and there was the same bad smell.

128
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,219
- Your Hi... Highness!

129
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,816
I've g... got it!
But it's very dr... dreadful!

130
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,533
- You want to terrify me?

131
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,771
- A co... co... conspiracy!
- Or put me to sleep?

132
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,217
- A co... conspiracy a...
...and an attempt on your life.

133
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,656
Some... something to do with the lift,
and the f... fourth floor!

134
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,893
- A conspiracy? An attempt to be made
on my life? And who's to make it?

135
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,657
Tel Oatis and that Steiner chap
to come here!

136
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,654
Your tea!
- Thank you.

137
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,211
- And how's it all going to end?

138
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,459
- We... well, un... unless
they kill you.

139
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,493
- Original!

140
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,253
- General Oatis, Your Highness,
and Major Steiner.

141
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,370
Oatis, there are preparations

142
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,054
under way for a conspiracy
and an attempt on my life.

143
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,974
It's to take place in the lift,
according to my information.

144
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,930
- That's impossible!
Who told you, Your Highness?

145
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,931
- Mr. Hample, here.

146
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,933
The astrologer from the "Tempo"!

147
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,973
The s... stars don't lie, General!

148
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,859
- See that we don't become
a laughing-stock!

149
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,813
I shall inform parliament, anyway.

150
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,976
You may go!

151
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,089
That astrologer guy must disappear!

152
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,818
That's task no.1!
- Yes, Sir!

153
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,810
- No, John!
Dear God, you mustn't die!

154
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,733
- I say, why the hysterics?

155
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,292
- You go and mind your cannon!

156
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,099
- Who's playing John?

157
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,172
- That slightly idiotic friend of yours,
the stick-in-the-mud.

158
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,491
- Really, Gugenheim's not as bad
as all that...

159
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,614
- They ought to mummify him
so that he doesn't rot in that mud.

160
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,572
And do you know what's happening
on the first night?

161
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,855
- Hm. A dress rehearsal.

162
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,214
- Mr. Steiner gets married
to Miss Molly Adams!

163
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,734
- But I've told you that I don't want
to get married!

164
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,812
- Oh you do, but you're too shy
to say so.

165
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,097
We'll invite five to six people:
Evelina, stage director Brant,

166
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,455
that Oatis of yours, my neighbour...

167
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,054
- Hample? That astrologer?
- Yes.

168
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,735
He's a terribly nice man!
He loves me, he mends my fuses

169
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,931
and he brings me fresh bread rolls...

170
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,932
Anyway, why, can't I ask
whom I like?

171
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,250
- Yes, of course, and see you ask
somebody who'll marry you!

172
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,808
- Oh but Robert...
Now then, do you love me of don't you?!

173
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,414
- I'm really not in the mood today!

174
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,977
- Evelina!

175
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,293
- G... good afternoon.

176
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,450
I want to t... talk to you, if I may.

177
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,815
- Can't it wait, Mr. Hample?

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,734
- No... it's... it's about...
...about the wedding!

179
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,613
- So you know?

180
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,652
- The stars told me!

181
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,857
Ho... how do you know?
- But what?

182
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,450
- That... we're going to get
ma... married!

183
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,218
- What do you mean, we?!
I'm marrying Mr. Steiner!

184
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,497
- Ah, I see, ye... yes, that's...
That's correct.

185
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,219
We'd live together, all three of us!

186
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,218
- Can you please tell me

187
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,699
how you imagine that would work
in practice?

188
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,610
- To tell you the truth,
I thought it a bit odd too...

189
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,018
...but it's what the s... stars say
and th... they don't lie!

190
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,888
- Per... perhaps we'll all get on well
to... together.

191
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,096
Molly!
Will you come and help these people,

192
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,216
they're looking for a certain
Mr. Hample!

193
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,372
- Can I help you?
- You're that fortune-teller guy?

194
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,578
Called Hample?
- Ye... yes.

195
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,492
Our Colonel would like to know
if his wife'll be having a boy

196
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,059
or a girl.

197
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm sorry, I...

198
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,693
Is that him?

199
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,659
Sorry! But you s... said...
...that I'm to find out what...

200
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,458
what... what... what's to be born!

201
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,217
- Nothing's to be born,
on the contrary, if you ask me!

202
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,328
Tie him up so he doesn't dodge about!

203
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,129
- So that was just a j... joke,
about th... the baby?!

204
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,738
- I don't get it, he's so calm!

205
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,015
Like blooming calf!

206
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,016
You see I know that my fr... friend's
co... coming, to save my li... life.

207
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,491
Sure thing...!

208
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,418
Some spares, Your Highness.

209
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,255
- Delightful. Thank you.

210
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,339
- Hope it keeps fine for you, Oscar!

211
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,378
- Couldn't you lend me
that Hample bloke for a few days?

212
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,020
I'm preparing some proposals
for parliament.

213
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,819
- The astrologer?
Of course.

214
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,778
- I'm sorry, but that won't be possible,
Your Highness.

215
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,373
Poor Hample passed on yesterday.

216
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,018
Something fell on his head.

217
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,657
- Hample is dead?

218
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,930
Don't do that in my presence, you know
that I can't bear the sight of blood!

219
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,817
- Sorry!

220
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,335
- I want to say this:

221
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,058
I got you out of a hole...

222
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,089
...but under one condition!
That it's kept under our hats!

223
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,617
- But Major, I'm a soldier,
I know all about top secrets!

224
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,013
Steiner, see they bring that Hample's
charts and maps to my flat -

225
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,613
I'm an antique collector.

226
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,089
- And have you verified it?

227
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,411
It's unbelievable!
Thank you.

228
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,209
The Neurology Institute has just asked
for the brain of that Hample chap!

229
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,129
- The brain of an astrologer of genius,
General. -

230
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,008
They'll preserve it in alcohol.
- Bravo! Gentlemen...

231
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,329
- Hample is dead
and now nothing will stand in our way!

232
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,331
- Only after that prophecy of Hample's

233
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,456
not even a mouse can slip
through to the King!

234
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,780
- I would take it upon me to propose
a certain plan.

235
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,532
- Go on.
- It has one disadvantage. -

236
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,497
It's too expensive!
- Never mind.!

237
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,219
We have the State Treasury
at our disposal...

238
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,658
- There is one person

239
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,614
who is received by the King
at any time of the day or night.

240
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,135
Evelina Keletti.

241
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,499
- But she won't murder the King!
- She will!

242
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,052
The permit to enter prison hospital.

243
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,496
- Ah yes, Mrs. Stubb!
This way.

244
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,415
She got the noose, but she's damned
lucky- she's dying - her liver!

245
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,056
About two more weeks and that's the end!

246
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,098
Here it is.
She's just got a visitor.

247
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,577
Can't you give up!
And you'll have to pay for that ball!

248
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,652
And this is what you would look like,
Mrs. Stubb!

249
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,219
- Jesus! Crikey!

250
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,929
- Just a mo!
I've seen that woman somewhere.

251
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,736
Show me! Damn you!
- Don't you touch it!

252
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,570
Well, Mrs. Stubb?
Hm...?

253
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,178
- Why ask?
Of course I will!

254
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,009
- Well really, Fanny,
surely I have something to say too!

255
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,249
Because if she's going to look like
this bird,

256
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,296
then I'll be wanting my bit of fun!

257
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,291
- And what would you be wanting
to do with me, you good-for-nothing!

258
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,848
- Hm...
Just normal like...

259
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,455
- Poor fool.

260
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,973
- I don't want to deny you a thing,
Mr. Bloom.

261
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,618
You can come any time you like.

262
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,854
Holy mackerel that dope gets
on my nerves!

263
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,896
- Steiner...
- But it's my own fault!

264
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,732
I botched it when I slit his throat.

265
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,970
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, show the gent you scar!

266
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,129
- The one where you botched it
when you tried to slit my throat.

267
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,812
- Yeah. Here.

268
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,813
And what about those other cases?

269
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,051
- My husband I bashed up
with a frying pan.

270
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,415
- You're a widow?
- Yeah. A widow.

271
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,413
And then there was
the forest ranger,...

272
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,899
...the organist and the bartender.

273
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,815
Four murders in all,
all sadistic.

274
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,416
I just said "Close your eyes,
sweetie-pie!" and slit!

275
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,008
Blood, that's my hobby, and gold, too!

276
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,377
You also stole, Mrs. Stubb?

277
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,815
- Yeah!
Like this.

278
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,020
Was it gold?!
- It was.

279
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,329
- Just imagine, Mr. Strauss,
that's how she pinched

280
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,775
a golden ladle this big,
in one of the museums!

281
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,378
Boy, did we have a time
trying to get it out afterwards.

282
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,575
I covered you that time,
at the museum, what?

283
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,413
- What about popping out
for a glass of rum Mr. Bloom?!

284
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,693
- Well, yeah, I could do that.
And I'll bring back

285
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,010
a drop for you too,
Fanny girl.

286
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,896
Mrs. Stubb, would you be capable
of killing just anybody?

287
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,335
- If it's a man...

288
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,299
- It'll be a man, Mrs. Stubb!
- It will it?

289
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,331
- And then you'll get a heap of money,
a plane ticket to South America,

290
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,216
and you can live it high!

291
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,733
But one other thing!

292
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,099
They said you'd last another two weeks,

293
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,015
but can't wait that long, Mrs. Stubb!

294
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,976
Come here!

295
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,335
Stick these labels onto these two boxes.

296
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,732
On the left, that's the astrologer
Hample, on the right the Stubb woman.

297
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,610
Send the left box
to the neurology institute,

298
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,339
take the right hand box personally
to Professor Somer's clinic.

299
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,093
There are brains inside those boxes,
take care you don't mix them up!

300
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,898
- The left to the neurology institute,
the right to Somer!

301
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,136
- To Professor Somer!

302
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,936
Right, the left to the neurology
institute, the right to Somer!

303
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,336
- Are you Somer?

304
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,572
Well O.K., Professor then.

305
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,059
I've brought the brain,
that Stubb woman's brain.

306
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,613
Would you please sign for it?

307
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,812
- I say, that's some brain!

308
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,209
You didn't get it mixed up
with another one, or something?!

309
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,858
- Well, really...!

310
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,771
- Let's hope not...!

311
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,219
- Professor...

312
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,059
- You are a tormentor, Professor!

313
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,212
- One must suffer for the sake
of beauty, madam.

314
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,019
- You certainly haven't suffered much
in that respect, Professor!

315
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,809
It's setting!
- Well, yes...

316
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,732
Would you kindly close your eyes?

317
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,458
- Yes.

318
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,213
We'll prise you out of your shell
in a few minutes' time!

319
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,212
Didn't she find it fishy?
- No. Thanks.

320
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,338
I told her it was a new face
and body mask.

321
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,012
And the mould is complete.

322
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,898
But anyway, why all this secrecy?

323
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,172
- She's to shoot
some dangerous sequences

324
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,137
and wants to do it herself,
without a stand-in.

325
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,213
The King is naturally worried
and has ordered a double to be made.

326
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,729
- Yes, I understand,

327
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,380
the sequences will just
have to be filmed without her knowledge.

328
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,178
- Yeah.

329
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,772
- But if it's such a top secret,
I can't very well ask for normal...

330
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,294
...that is to say human, material.

331
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,098
Is there any other possibility?

332
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,419
You can make your choice, the body can
either be made up of veal or of pork.

333
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,858
So. What are you staring at?!
A beauty parlour, see!

334
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,212
Who did the stomach?

335
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,779
- I did, Sir.

336
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,532
- I could have guessed!

337
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,738
What on earth made you put in
a rumen, third stomach, and maw?!

338
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,812
She'd ruminate, you somnambulist!

339
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,416
Take care I don't make you unemployed!

340
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,456
Put it right!

341
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,499
She must have been really brainy,
Professor!

342
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,494
Look at this, it's as big
as a man's brain...

343
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,411
- Yes, I noticed that, too.

344
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,173
- And who was this Mrs. Stubb?

345
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,775
- I don't know, but in any case
she must have been a woman

346
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,055
of quite unusual intelligence.

347
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,256
- Evidently had great acting talent.

348
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,854
- Well that doesn't signify
great intelligence!

349
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,250
- If she's to play double
to Evelina Keletti...

350
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,017
- I beg your pardon?
There now. Finished!

351
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,856
Well, gentlemen...

352
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,693
I think that we can be satisfied,
gentlemen!

353
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,139
Fantastic!

354
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,778
- Perfect job!
Right down to the last freckle!

355
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,413
- Is she alive?
- We left that job for you.

356
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,772
You're going to breathe life
into the body, like God the Creator!

357
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,379
- I?
- Yes.

358
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,140
Consider it a little mark of favour.

359
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,329
Just like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

360
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,018
H... h... how d... dare you?!

361
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,138
- Just normal, a bit of shock, that's
all. Look, how beautifully she stutters!

362
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,249
Who did the vocal chords?

363
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,138
- I did.

364
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,497
- Take care I don't make you unemployed!

365
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,973
Well, Mrs. Stubb, you're back
on this earth!

366
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,338
- How come how come
I've g... got this?

367
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,651
Where on earth did a chap
like me get this?

368
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,819
Chap... Chap...

369
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,774
You're a woman and we don't expect
much logic, but surely, Mrs. Stubb?

370
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,737
- Do... don't call me Mrs. Stubb!

371
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,618
And g... go away, how can you bother
a chap in this st... state of undress!

372
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,930
- Chap?
Come now, get hold of yourself.

373
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,375
Get used to it O.K.!

374
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,451
Never mind, you'll settle down in time.

375
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,930
- And what are you doing here,
S... Steiner?

376
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,337
- There now, you know this gentleman,
don't you? Your memory's coming back!

377
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,328
You've got some clothes for her.
There's a spare wig over there.

378
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,730
It'll be better if we leave,
she needs quiet.

379
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,414
Lots of luck, Mrs. Stubb.

380
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,415
- I'm no M... Mrs. Stubb.

381
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,457
They killed me, didn't they!

382
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,770
- They had meant to hang you,

383
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,658
but you died of your own accord
at the prison hospital, Mrs. Stubb.

384
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,538
- Holy mackerel!
Will you stop it!

385
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,174
And these w... will have to go
t... too!

386
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,693
After all, I'm no woman!

387
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,852
- Oh yes you are,
take a good look!

388
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,210
- But...
But this is E... Evelina Keletti!

389
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,457
What is this supposed to mean,
S... Steiner?!

390
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,620
- Well then I'll explain all over
again.

391
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,010
You're Fanny Stubb,
the widow of Ignatius Stubb...

392
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,818
- What?

393
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,493
A widow? I'm a wi... widow?

394
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,411
- But of course you're a widow!

395
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,653
- Well in that c... case
ev... everything's O.K.

396
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,651
- That's fine then!

397
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,174
- If I'm a widow
then I must h... have these too.

398
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,139
Widows do.
Well, c... continue!

399
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,419
- And now, Mrs. Stubb,
why have we given you back your life...

400
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,856
You are now going to undertake
your fifth murder.

401
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,817
- Right.
- What?

402
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,929
What? I'm to ki... kill somebody?

403
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,655
- But of course.
The King!

404
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,538
You said:
"As long as it's a man...!

405
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,090
B...
- Never mind him, that's the cook.

406
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,818
What is it, Bobo?
- Some man's waiting downstairs.

407
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,379
Such a...

408
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,976
- Just a moment, Mrs. Stubb!

409
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,854
Excuse me, Mrs. Stubb!

410
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,218
- One minute!

411
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,212
- Good evening.

412
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,610
- That's better! Well, I've come,
that was our agreement...

413
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,697
- Ah yes.
You're quick, aren't you!

414
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,654
Well, never mind. At least Mrs. Stubb
won't be bored tonight...

415
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,816
This way.

416
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,091
Well now, isn't this a surprise,
Mrs. Stubb?

417
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,015
Come, come, come, come!

418
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,489
- Christ, Fanny
you're a sight for sore eyes!

419
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,575
Who's that?
- Oh but you know him very well,

420
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,015
Mrs. Stubb.
Just as soon as you remember!

421
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,291
I'll lend you a pair of pyjamas!

422
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,416
- What's that?
- Pyjamas.

423
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,419
- Oh, I see.

424
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,414
- But I don't want to stay here
w... with him!

425
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,131
- No wild orgies, mind,
the chef's bedroom is below!

426
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,579
You can burn those pyjamas
in the morning!

427
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,531
- G... go a... away!

428
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,939
- Stop stuttering and take off
those glad rags!

429
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,295
I said take off those glad rags!

430
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,618
Did you hear, you so-and-so!

431
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,170
When you were an old nag
I was good enough, what?

432
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,012
And now I'm not to touch you, what?

433
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,448
- St... stop pawing me about,
you p... pig!

434
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,496
- You're so choosy all of a sudden!

435
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,055
Look...
Well.

436
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,099
Look here! Got a pail?

437
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,331
- There's w... water in there.
- Now then, come on!

438
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,854
Where's that pail then?!

439
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,129
Fanny, what's this hissing noise?

440
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,696
What sort of stupid joke is this?
Cripes!

441
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,298
What son-of-a-bitch
thought up this?

442
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,053
Ha, just look at the bright laddie -
fresh out of Sing-Sing!

443
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,089
You...
You damned old moll!

444
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,169
A cell all over again, or what?

445
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,091
You think you can get away
with dousing decent people

446
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,289
and thingummy...

447
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,848
Open up, will you! Open up,
I'm no chick,

448
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,898
I've got out of a different kind
of cell in my time!

449
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,093
I'll show you...!
- As you like - I don't feel anything.

450
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,215
Hm.
Like a couple of animals!

451
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,935
We won't be getting much sleep tonight!
- Let's hope

452
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,409
he doesn't break her or something!

453
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,537
- It's young, fresh veal.

454
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,175
- Now I'll show you who's master!

455
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,696
- How do you do, I'm H... Hample!

456
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,534
- Just a mo! Look here, you bitch,
I'll tear you apart I will! You...

457
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,139
...you old duffer!

458
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,251
I'll set that new trap of yours
back into shape, you...

459
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,291
Bobo!

460
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,932
Bobo!

461
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,773
- You're b... bats, B... Bobo!
Stop it!

462
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,818
You've had one sp... spot of trouble
with that s... sword already!

463
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,652
I'm S... Stuart!

464
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,017
Do you re... remember when I told you
I'd become a wi... widow?

465
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,259
Well, h... here we are!

466
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,210
- Wha... what - Stuart?
- I'll explain!

467
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,172
What goings-on!

468
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,975
That's no villa, that's a brothel!

469
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,417
- But Alfred, Steiner is a young man
full of temperament...

470
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,416
And I'm to open negotiations with such
rake about a real estate sale...!

471
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,849
You should warn that Molly of yours,
so that she knows she's marrying!

472
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,648
- Love is love...

473
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,018
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

474
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,137
- Stop! What a bit of luck!
- I beg your pardon...!

475
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,575
- Come here, I'll tear you apart
and chop you up, I will!

476
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,492
- Alfred!
- Alfred!

477
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,854
She's got an Alfred now...!
- Alfred!!!

478
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,419
- What's going on here?!

479
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,617
- So you've got a new guy again?!
Fast worker, you are!

480
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,970
- Away with you my man
or I'll have you arrested this minute!

481
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,937
- You take care old chap,

482
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,453
I've got some right to this bird too!

483
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,019
For five years I rounded up
all the fancy jobs for her,

484
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,499
and I sat in the clink in her place,
too!

485
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,615
And she's suddenly gone hoity-toity
on me!

486
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,450
- Police!

487
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,137
Police!!!
- I'm coming, Mr. Keletti!

488
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,014
Get out, you scoundrel! There!

489
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,975
- You wait, Fanny, I'll beat up

490
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,573
that freckled fanny of yours for you!
You...!

491
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,409
Freckled...
You undressed in front of this man?

492
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,330
- Well, really, Alfred...!

493
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,295
- I can see that you haven't told me
everything by far about your past!

494
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,656
- Don't be disgusting!

495
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,376
Where now, Mr. Keletti?
- First to the bank

496
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,292
and then about that real estate
to that...

497
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,411
...Steiner's!
- Yes, Mr. Keletti.

498
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,730
- The sun has hidden its countenance
behind the bulk of Mount Yve!

499
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,380
The hour of your death has arrived!

500
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,853
- Stop!

501
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,573
Stop! That's enough!

502
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,897
Christ, Gugenheim, what are there for?!

503
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,978
- Well really, I thought...

504
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,449
- Oh I see, you thought?

505
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,652
But you never think, so will you kindly
not break that rule at least!

506
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,739
What are you doing
after the rehearsal?

507
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,811
- I've got a date with the King.

508
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,017
- Listen, Evelina, be a dear and invite
the King to my wedding, will you?

509
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,654
You see...
- Why not ask him yourself?

510
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,612
I'll arrange a royal audience for you.
- Well, shall we continue!

511
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,092
Start again from "Goodbye, friends!"!

512
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,131
- Goodbye, friends!

513
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,859
Long live good old England!

514
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,418
- Let not a drop of blood be wasted!

515
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,536
John!
- Untie them!

516
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,531
- No!
You will die too. And first!

517
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,299
Stop!

518
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,736
Who put the live ammo in there?!
Props, here to me!

519
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,969
Listen, you, I'll have you arrested!
Do you know what could have happened?!

520
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,214
How are you feeling, Madame?
- Evelina!

521
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,733
- Are you all right?

522
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,049
- He... he cou... could have
ki... killed me!

523
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,218
- Shock!

524
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,051
I think that means we've finished
for today!

525
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,094
Damn it!

526
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,699
- He said you're not to get close
to the window!

527
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,814
And not to out into the garden
before nightfall.

528
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,334
I say, isn't this wrong or something?

529
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,971
Yes, that's better!
That looks more like it.

530
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,972
- And wha... what do I do with this,
B... Bobo?

531
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,773
- I don't know, I'm not a girl!

532
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,658
And I only studied
at the Military Academy.

533
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,615
Got a s... safety-pin?
- Yeah.

534
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,138
Doesn't that hurt?

535
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,538
- No.
H... how do we work it t... tonight?

536
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,299
- As soon as Steiner locks everything up
and goes into his bedroom,

537
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,049
I'll get a ladder up,
you climb down and we'll disappear.

538
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,331
- You... you're running away
wi... with me, Bobo?

539
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,457
- Yeah. I don't want to have
anything more to do with Steiner.

540
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,655
- Bobo!
- Lo... look here,

541
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,775
don't do that... get away from me!

542
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,010
- D... don't be idiotic!
This is nothing

543
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,328
but a hun... hundredweight
of v... veal!

544
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,014
- That's just the thing, and I'm a chef!

545
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,255
I'll brush it out for you!

546
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,657
Put that thing out!
Quick!

547
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,536
My name is Keletti.

548
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,094
- Mr. Steiner is... not...
- Show me those clothes!

549
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,417
- Oh no, you'd soil you hands,
they're messy and crushed!

550
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,970
- Thank you, I've seen quite enough!

551
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,417
- Peggy! Peggy!

552
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,611
Just imagine Alfred,
I made a great buy today!

553
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,179
Isn't it beautiful?

554
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,978
You gave the servants the day off?
Why?

555
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,612
- Wait and you'll see why.
Where have you been?

556
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,658
Ah, what a day this has been...

557
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,895
Nothing but excitements
and thrills all day long!

558
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,812
- Really?! But I can see
that your clothes are cleaned up!

559
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,373
The thrills you experienced on the floor
or directly on the dung-heap?!

560
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,815
- What are you saying, Alfred?

561
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,528
- You tell me!
Tell me of the fun you had with Steiner!

562
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:15,569
Who is better, that stinking tramp
who knows all about your freckles,

563
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,453
of Steiner, who wipes his feet on you?!

564
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,692
I haven't been to Steiner's flat
in my life!

565
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,498
- That you have! And naked!

566
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,374
- Why are you so offensive?
You know that I'm incapable of lying!

567
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,893
- You...

568
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,059
You...

569
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,169
You... incapable of lying?!
You snake-in-the-grass!

570
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,093
Ouch!
- Alfred, did you hurt yourself?

571
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,890
My conscience is as pure as fallen snow!

572
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,295
- You unscrupulous monster!

573
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,613
You tramp's concubine!

574
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,933
What's the matter with him?

575
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,734
- Nothing.
- Come along home!

576
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,893
- Don't do that, Mr. Keletti!

577
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,208
- You there, kick that chair away,
will you!

578
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,139
Don't do it!

579
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,530
We should have that repaired,
Mr. Keletti. It could kill somebody!

580
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,898
Take that chair away
or you're fired without notice!

581
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,336
- But it's quite unnecessary,
Mr. Keletti!

582
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,017
- I have killed my wife, I want to die!

583
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,217
- That woman looks the very image
of your late wife...

584
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,499
- What do you mean by that?

585
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,016
- Well. If we manage to lure her
in here, you'll be in the clear!

586
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,288
I've got a ladder ready, Mr. Keletti!

587
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,450
- A ladder?
- You can depend on me!

588
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,018
Do you see the likeness?

589
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,458
- Stuart, listen, that's settled,
right?

590
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,491
I'll come and get you
through the window.

591
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,737
Damn it, stop smoking! -
What if he walked in here...

592
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,651
- Hell!

593
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,693
Will you kindly not do this!

594
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,008
But its so ho... hot in here.

595
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,411
- You'll be paying a visit
to the King tomorrow.

596
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,413
You'll be given your directions
and the knife in the morning.

597
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,371
Good night!

598
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,298
- These damn si... silly tricks
of yours, Bobo?! Bo... Bobo!

599
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,410
Stuart!
Stuart!

600
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,411
Where are you, damn it all?
Steiner's fast asleep.

601
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,209
Come along, we've got to go!

602
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,216
- ... men have more resistance.

603
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,211
But if you give a woman a good sniff,

604
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,011
she doesn't wake up
until she's in kingdom come!

605
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,538
- What do you mean "kingdom come"?

606
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,417
- Obvious.
We'll turn on the gas!

607
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,576
And in the morning the whole world
will hear that you wife

608
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,457
committed SUICIDE...

609
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,815
And you'll be a widower,
but not a murderer!

610
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,209
- Thank you. I'll never forget
what you've done for me!

611
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,652
Where on earth did that Steiner
find such a perfect duplicate?!

612
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,888
Poor girl! Now she'll find the corpse.

613
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,258
Is there anything wrong?

614
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,770
There must be -
Madam wants her tea with rum!

615
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,933
Excuse me.

616
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,575
Do please have a little understanding
for our jobs!

617
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,492
Please don't be angry, but the public
wants to be kept informed.

618
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,695
Wants to know how Mrs. Keletti
is feeling.

619
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,929
- After that shock she received
yesterday at the theatre!

620
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,535
- Excuse me, gentlemen!
Could I talk to her?

621
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,252
Impossible! My wife isn't...
...isn't quite herself this morning!

622
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,575
- I quite understand.

623
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,491
I was present when it happened
at the theatre yesterday.

624
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,215
But... Please understand I must
talk to her! The premiere's approaching!

625
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,580
I'm telling you for the last time
that she's unconscious

626
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,179
and that I refuse to let you in!

627
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,618
Excuse me... - Madame for the "Tempo".
- For the "Express"!

628
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,011
- Madam, don't forget
the premiere!

629
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,177
She didn't even recognize me! -
It's more serious than I thought.

630
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,339
She take my car!

631
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,139
- Follow her!

632
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,733
I heard that you have suffered
a bad shock, madam.

633
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,936
- Th... that's not im... important
just now!

634
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,932
- Of course.
Of course.

635
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,372
Well, and what would you be willing

636
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,020
to pay for those maps?
- A... anything.

637
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,059
- Surely not anything?!

638
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,050
Anything I may ask for?
- Everything.

639
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,734
- But for a man of my temperament

640
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,014
that can mean but a single thing,
madam...

641
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,618
This body of mine is not of fir...
...first-rate importance to me.

642
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,813
- But it is to me!
I've been longing for you for years!

643
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,379
I dream of you!

644
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,170
- No... no kissing!

645
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,495
- My word, that's substantial underwear
you're wearing my dear...!

646
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,259
How does one take them off?
- I d... don't know!

647
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,132
And interesting model!

648
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,455
Who's the visitor?
- Some reporter.

649
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,936
It's nothing but work, work, work
at our place Gerti.

650
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,019
Ah...!

651
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,296
A bit of masochist, what?

652
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,250
Do y... you like ve... veal?

653
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,210
- Why?
- Nothing. Just a question.

654
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,650
We'll talk later,
O.K.?

655
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,849
I haven't experienced such a thrill
for years, madam!

656
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,850
No, Gerti, that doesn't matter a bit,
even if he is working!

657
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,489
Omar would never forgive you
for not dropping in.

658
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,775
This way.
- Oh!

659
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,658
- Ugh, Omar!

660
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,574
You should be ashamed of yourself!
This is the end between you and me!

661
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,019
- Who's that?

662
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,014
- Don't you pretend that you
don't know me, you... You slut!

663
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,976
- Here she is!

664
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,336
Come on in, quick!

665
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,211
- Dear God, Mary,
we must be sensible!

666
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,733
- Sensible?!

667
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,011
- Couldn't you at least put on
your clothes?

668
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,610
We must keep this quiet, Mary!
My career's at stake!

669
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,497
- Keep it quiet you may,

670
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,810
but it means an end to my love!

671
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,891
- Keep it quiet you may,
but it means an end to my love!

672
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,336
- ... an end to my love.
- Oh!

673
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,610
- General! Words fail me...!

674
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,259
- What do you all want in here?!
Out, immediately!!!

675
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,808
- Excuse me, but I've got a press card!

676
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,376
Your wife has just broken up my home!

677
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,576
- Oh madam, I wouldn't take it
as hard as all that!

678
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,452
You know that these artists have
a different sort of set of morals -

679
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,689
they are like birds.

680
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,254
- Bu... but the ma... maps are mine
now, aren't they?

681
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,649
- How's that?
How's that?

682
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,097
- But you... you un... undressed me!

683
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,968
- But you know that we didn't
get as far as...

684
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,212
- Well then everybody go a... away,
so that he can undress me!

685
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,973
- Oh!
- This is unbelievable!

686
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,891
- You see Madame Keletti
is an antiques collector

687
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,493
and she wanted... My maps.

688
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,372
- I wouldn't take it so hard!
- Nor I!

689
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,098
- You know these collectors...
They have a different set of morals -

690
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,694
like the worker-bee. Isn't that right?

691
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:47,769
- How could you make such shameless use
of my wife's passionate nature?!

692
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,408
I'm no... no wife of y... yours!

693
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,492
He wanted to turn the ga... gas on me!

694
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,815
- Please don't forget
that she has experienced a shock!

695
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,132
You must convince her that she's
your wife! Otherwise - prison for you!

696
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,859
- But of course she's my wife!

697
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,048
This will mean a duel!
- A duel! Oh!

698
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,653
- You overdid that!

699
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:11,692
- You see, Omar, a duel!
Because of some maps...

700
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,411
- Well, do I get undressed or...
- Christ, no!

701
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,250
Dear God, do understand my situation...

702
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,296
- Be quiet! This is the end
between the two of us!

703
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,251
Gerti will be my witness at court!

704
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,568
- Mary,...
- At court? Oh!

705
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,059
- Why take it to court, madam?!

706
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,698
Why break up a family,
the very foundation of society?

707
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,736
Look here, why don't you two
shake hands.

708
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,731
- I ne... need those ma... maps!
Come on, let's go into the next room,

709
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,253
maybe we'll manage to get these things
o... off if we join forces!

710
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,377
- Great God, that's enough!
You can keep those damned maps,

711
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,020
and get out!
Everybody out!

712
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,370
- We don't get out,
it's you who gets out!

713
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,928
You lecher!
The villa belongs to me!

714
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,294
After what has happened
I assume you must realize

715
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,690
that this can end only in one way-
catastrophe.

716
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,659
- We'll have to get rid of her-
the sooner the better!

717
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,889
Let her have those charts or she'll
tear the house down!

718
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,379
- We must set our plans very cleverly!

719
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,690
She's gone. Disappeared!

720
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,770
- This is a very dangerous situation!

721
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,816
- The woman's a notorious murderer!

722
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,613
If she kills someone, it'll be our end!

723
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,089
- They'll catch her and she'll blab!

724
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,859
- The King will disband the army
day after tomorrow!

725
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,168
And then he'll have it out with us!

726
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,093
Leave it!
Thank you, Steiner...!

727
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,248
- If he's dead he won't be able to have
anything out with us...!

728
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,578
I am willing to lay down my life
in this cause.

729
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,292
I shall break into his bedroom and...

730
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,251
- And, and, and, and... What?

731
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,896
- I know how this must be done!

732
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,488
I had been looking forward
to my wedding very much indeed,

733
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,056
gentlemen, but I am willing to sacrifice
anything for our cause!

734
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,535
My fiance Miss Molly Adams
has been granted an audience

735
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,258
with the King toady at one o'clock.

736
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,252
- But that means that she would die to!

737
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,735
- There's nothing to be done about that!
- Jesus Christ!

738
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,015
- That's the only possible solution.

739
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,096
- I... is that you, B... Bobo?

740
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,179
S... Stuart.

741
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,250
Wh... what's that you're saying?
Molly Adams?

742
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,419
No... no I don't understand you!

743
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,419
Listen carefully, Stuart!

744
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,695
They want to do Molly in,
do you understand?

745
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,892
The King and Molly!

746
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,217
I didn't hear the end.
But you're an astrologer, aren't you...?

747
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,259
Hm.

748
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,138
Explosion, wardrobe department.

749
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,098
Wardrobe...

750
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,977
One o'clock, explosion...

751
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,019
Bring me an aspirin
and a glass of water!

752
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,016
It'll be quite easy!

753
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,219
But how?

754
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,733
This is the way!

755
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,897
I'll be waiting downstairs
and you'll ask her in here.

756
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,290
I'll call her to the window
from the garden,

757
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,612
you'll have the kindness to step
on that loose parquet and that's that!

758
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,696
Death by misadventure!
- Let's hope it works out his time!

759
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,418
- We'll have to test the plan!

760
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,056
Hey, what are you doing there?!

761
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,136
Mr. Keletti!
Mr. Keletti!

762
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,419
- What is it?
- She's running away!

763
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,651
Just look up there, to your left!
- Hold her back!

764
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,496
Mr. Keletti...

765
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:35,818
Come along in, I'm just having a bath!
- Mo... Molly...

766
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,415
Come along into the bathroom,
don't stand out there in the hall!

767
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,809
I phoned your house a few minutes ago
and the secretary told me

768
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,849
that your husband had something wrong
with his head. Just a migraine, maybe?

769
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,257
- Yeah.
A migraine.

770
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,690
- Be a dear and scrub my back, will you?
- Yeah.

771
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,896
- I'm to be at the palace in an hour
and this is the state I'm still in...

772
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,379
I'm so nervous

773
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,212
that I'd much rather not go there
at all.

774
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:18,619
- Don't go! Do... don't go!
We... we'll stay here

775
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,260
and I... I'll gi... give you
your b... bath.

776
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,452
- Are you mad?! I had a new dress
made for the occasion...

777
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,093
Do you know what, why don't you go
and have a look at it?

778
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,693
- And what about he... here.

779
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,894
- No, thanks.
- And your t... tummy!

780
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,936
- That's enough!

781
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,537
Listen, what's wrong with you?!

782
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,618
- Go and take a look at that dress,
you're keeping me!

783
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,899
How am I to address the King, -
Your Highness or Your Royal Highness?

784
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,410
- You're no... not going to see
any King!

785
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,496
- Yes, I'm walking,
it's such a little way

786
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,099
it's not worth taking the car!

787
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,812
- No, I w... won't let you go!

788
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,017
- Why not? You arranged the audience
for me yourself!

789
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,011
- You're st... staying put!

790
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,819
- What on earth has got into you
today!

791
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,015
Surely you're not jealous now...?

792
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,694
Give me that key!
- No... no I w... won't!

793
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,614
- Evelina!
- There!

794
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,615
The jealous bitch!

795
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,733
Mind! Here they are!

796
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,259
Now!

797
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,213
Oh!

798
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,530
Can't you be more careful, man?!

799
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,252
Our apologies, madam!

800
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,535
We'll set this right this very minute.

801
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,933
The shoe!

802
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,689
When is it timed for...
- In five minutes.

803
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,259
Go!

804
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,059
Taxi!

805
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,012
Taxi!

806
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,214
What's the hurry, Fanny!
We've got something to settle first!

807
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,899
There now, now you won't run out on me,
you...

808
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,369
You bitch!
Wait! Wait!

809
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,137
Help! Help!
- Sorry.

810
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:59,697
- N... nothing happened! Taxi!
- Sorry!

811
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,173
I am quite exceptionally happy
to meet you.

812
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,492
Madame Keletti has often been
telling me about you.

813
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,017
She is as unusually wise
and witty young lady.

814
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,609
And I have a great respect
for her opi...

815
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,814
Don't you hear something ticking
by any chance?

816
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:25,138
- Le... let go! Le... let go!
Un... un... get undressed!

817
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,817
- I?
- Molly!

818
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,978
- M... Molly, get un... undressed!
Come here! Come here! Come here!

819
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:36,132
- Good heavens, Evelina...
Have you gone mad, God, are you crazy?!

820
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,018
- Y... your dr... dress! Wait!
- Leave me alone!

821
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,497
Madame Keletti...!
- Don't take my dress!

822
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:45,695
- Now the, Mrs. Keletti,...!
I know you want to please me.

823
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,299
But at such a price, surely...

824
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,929
The girl will catch cold!

825
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,375
- Dear God! Please turn round,
Your Highness!

826
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,655
- M... Molly, come on! Come on!
- Yes, of course.

827
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,610
Madame Keletti,
really this just will not do...!

828
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,015
Do realize what would happen
if the Prime Minister walked in...!

829
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,415
- Ouch!
- Molly!

830
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,417
- Mrs. Keletti! That's enough!

831
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,137
Listen, you must have been drinking!

832
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,129
Come here and brea...
- Excuse me!

833
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,171
Wh... whoops!

834
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,855
And what do I walk home in...?
- You went a bit far, this time,

835
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,089
Mrs. Keletti!

836
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,053
This get-up gives rather
a bad impression.

837
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,854
...you are our last hope!

838
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,817
The King will be disbanding the army
the day after tomorrow.

839
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:42,769
Anyway, they do say
that you're a better shot then actor!

840
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,017
- How dare you...!
- But I'd be capable of making you

841
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,579
the first tragedian in the land,
do you understand?! -

842
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,537
Othello, Hamlet, Romeo,...

843
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:54,417
...Picasso! Or manager of this theatre,
or Minister of Culture - anything!

844
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,612
- But a King, that's no small matter...!

845
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,813
Regicide...

846
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,180
- It won't be you,
it'll be the props man!

847
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,818
- What do you mean, the props man?

848
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,379
- You know what happened
at the rehearsal!

849
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,819
There'll be "misadventure" again -
a live bullet...!

850
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,530
Did you say theatre manager?

851
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,815
I thought she'd gone crazy!
And just imagine,

852
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,370
in the end she climbed over the balcony
in Mr. Hample's flat.

853
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,449
- Hample's flat?
Hm.

854
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,454
But how could Mrs. Keletti have know
what was afoot?

855
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,495
- She's rather queer nowadays
altogether.

856
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,498
- What do you mean, queer?

857
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,728
- She keeps looking at me
in such a moon-struck way...

858
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,893
And she stutters!

859
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,298
- What?!
- Miss Molly onstage!

860
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,132
- She stutters?

861
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,299
- But the king was wonderful!

862
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,133
Just imagine, he accepted my invitation
to attend our wedding!

863
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,051
Are you glad?
Bye-bye.

864
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,536
Professor Somer?
Steiner.

865
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:18,770
Would you be so kind as to borrow
the brain of astrologer Hample

866
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:21,010
from the neurology institute?

867
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,409
I am of the opinion
that the man's alive.

868
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,612
- You were right,
some error must have been made.

869
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,608
This is definitely a woman's brain!

870
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,809
The Stubb woman. Fanny Stubb.

871
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,294
All right then,
but where is Hample running around?

872
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,051
Don't you worry about that.

873
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,900
And that'll be the end of you,
Stuart Hample!

874
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:54,017
It's veal! - Surely we won't
throw it out...

875
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,500
Any way, do you know how much
such a wedding feast comes to?

876
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,819
- All right! In that case let's put
a veal joint on the menu...

877
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,096
And we can make soup of this.

878
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,019
- And what else?

879
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,619
- And then we could have
some veal knuckles,

880
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:12,137
or ragout, or aspic...
It's make a beautiful aspic!

881
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:18,976
Will you kindly step back, Major,
or you'll get blood all over you!

882
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,614
- Wait! You know that I can't
bear the sight of blood!

883
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,215
My God, your disposition, Man...

884
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,619
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Well! O.K.!

885
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,939
- My dr... dress, B... Bobo!

886
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,059
- Take it! There's your dress, take it!
Yeah.

887
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,738
Well. Wait - fasten this on!

888
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,412
As witness at the wedding
you have to have it.

889
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,810
Bon appetit!
- Thank you.

890
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,498
What a pity the King had to go away.
I heard that veal knuckles

891
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,411
are his favourite speciality.

892
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,613
- You seem to be in a marvellous mood
today, madam! Your health!

893
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,379
Hey!

894
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:26,889
Sorry.

895
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,813
- She's trying to forget the loss
her husband!

896
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,217
- I'm just as badly off in that respect
as you are, madam. There. -

897
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,499
All alone.

898
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,372
What do you say we both change our lives
from the very foundations?

899
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,889
What do you say to that?
- I... I'd sure need that...

900
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,011
...you don't know how!
- Cheers!

901
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,930
I'm really thinking of getting married
again!

902
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,013
I've made an appointment for you
this afternoon with Professor Somer

903
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,658
about that stuttering of yours.

904
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,852
He says he'll put you right by the time
the evening performance starts!

905
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,817
- Th... that makes me
a h... happy woman!

906
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:59,338
I shall be watching your performance
from the Royal box, dear Evelina!

907
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,220
- Maybe it would be better
if you were to sit elsewhere...!

908
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,697
- W... why should you sit
el... elsewhere?

909
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,338
- Oh that was just a little joke!

910
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,418
Do you remember what happened
when General Stollwerk got married?

911
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,931
- I heard that he got married
in a submarine

912
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,051
and that they ran out of air
in the middle of the marriage ceremony!

913
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,018
An editor once got married
in a balloon

914
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,696
and they le... left the I... load on.

915
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,416
When they were over the pond
they began to sink

916
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,775
and they h... had to throw out
the pri... priest!

917
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,579
You made that up, madam!
- No! No! No!

918
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,168
That happened to one of o... our staff
at the "Te... Tempo"!"

919
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:38,138
- You on the staff of the Tempo?
I know it was a joke!

920
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,410
- All actresses like making up stories,
don't they?

921
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:45,569
- Not only actresses!
Opera singers, soubrettes...!

922
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,454
Listen, man, you must have killed

923
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,258
the real Mrs. Keletti
for the wedding feast!

924
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,533
- Do you think so?

925
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,299
- This is the Hample guy!

926
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,415
- But then, in our line of business
things are different,

927
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,979
one soldier with too much imagination

928
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,493
can cause the whole regiment
to fall apart...!

929
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,048
- I personally do not have
any great faith in dreamers either.

930
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,213
But I do appreciate a bit of imagination
in women and in cooks.

931
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,969
You have an excellent chef,
Madame!

932
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,650
The ve... veal is delectable!

933
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,571
The fork slides into it like butter!

934
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,658
- I had meat prepared in this fashion
only once before in my life.

935
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:23,689
That was on Quadapulpo.
- But they are cannibals!

936
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,808
- Perhaps you are a cannibal
and don't even realize it!

937
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:31,853
Yes, Sir?

938
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,851
- You've got me into a fine mess,
my man!

939
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,931
We've just eaten a famous actress,
understand?!

940
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,535
And the General wanted to marry her!
- But he had three helpings!

941
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,809
- We're cannibals
and that's against the law!

942
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,208
- What do you mean to do?

943
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,816
- There's only one thing left for me
to do!

944
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,693
- Where are you go... going?

945
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,128
- Why do you ask, Stuart Hample?

946
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,296
- W... why is Oa... Oatis to sit
else... elsewhere?

947
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,211
What are you planning
at the th... theatre?

948
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,096
Well that's one thing you won't get
to know!

949
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,654
Bobo!
B... Bobo!

950
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:31,017
- You scoundrel, it's all your fault
that we ate up Mrs. Keletti!

951
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:36,054
- She's going to haunt you,
all ch... chewed up as she is!

952
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,691
Swing at him!

953
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,139
- Swing at him!

954
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,257
Damn it, swing at him, will you!!!

955
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,370
Calm down, Madame! Professor Somer
has managed greater miracles!

956
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,889
- Of course.
But how did it happen?

957
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,013
- A bit of bad luck.
He was combing his hair and...

958
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,813
- Hm, hm.

959
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,219
Can you save him?

960
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,059
- If he lived through this,

961
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,334
then certainly!

962
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,331
Will you please follow me, Madame,

963
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,337
this little stuttering trouble of yours
will be set right by my first assistant.

964
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,853
He's an expert on vocal chords.

965
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,818
It is all a matter of just
a few minutes, Madame.

966
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,733
Set the lights!

967
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,258
Vocal chords are no problem!

968
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,859
There is a total of fifteen
in the human being,

969
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,134
the squirrel only has two

970
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,415
and that explains why there is
such peace and quiet in a forest.

971
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,139
Excuse me.

972
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:29,092
You sure finished him off,
you boffin...!

973
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,890
Take care I don't make you
unemployed...!

974
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,016
- Poor little Molly,
she'll go out of her mind for grief!

975
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,054
- This means the premiere's off

976
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,779
and I've got a ticket...!
Take it away!

977
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,820
I th... think this could still be
settled some w... way or other!

978
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,010
W... wouldn't it be a pity of Molly
were to be done out of a hu... husband

979
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,649
and you out of your p... premiere!
- And what do you suggest?

980
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,136
Si... simple - give my brain
to S... Steiner

981
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:05,010
and put that o... one in he... here!

982
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,458
And what you would do in a man's body
I can't imagine, Mrs. Keletti!

983
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,334
I'm n... not the Ke... Keletti woman
at all!

984
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:16,851
It's me, S... Stuart Hample!
And this is veal!

985
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,168
You'll sa... save yourself having to do
another o... operation!

986
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,009
That lady is sure n... not to stutter!

987
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:34,778
Can you tell me,
why is it taking so long?

988
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,420
- Three and a half hours
isn't that long, Sir!

989
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,810
Finish this off!
How are you doing?

990
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,419
- Practically finished.

991
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,009
- And now breathe life into her!

992
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,011
I don't want to get
a slap for my trouble!

993
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,012
Don't you worry,

994
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,611
that was quite a different matter
when Mr. Hample was waking up to life.

995
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,375
Here we can assume
that this Mrs. Stubb was a lady,

996
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,530
and that she'll behave accordingly.

997
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,817
She'll be taken aback for a little
while... We must be tactful!

998
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:41,616
Come here, you with glasses!

999
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,618
So you feel like having it out
with the old Stubb girl?!

1000
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,817
- Just you calm down, Mrs. Stubb!
Calm down, please!

1001
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,971
Help me please!
Help me!

1002
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,732
Do stop it, Mrs. Stubb!

1003
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,691
He's a family man, has two children!

1004
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,611
- No! No! No! No!

1005
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,693
Pull yourself together!

1006
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,499
Did you see that show
of sexual temperament,

1007
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,138
that insatiable personality?

1008
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:04,974
That must have been some bird!
- Is this possible?

1009
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,539
- Just you calm down, Mrs. Stubb!

1010
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,413
You have now become a young
famous actress,

1011
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,618
your name is Evelina Keletti
and you're a widow.

1012
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,648
- Evelina Ke...
...Evelina Keletti.

1013
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,696
- Listen, do you have any
stage experience?

1014
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,169
- Yeah.
- What sort of part?

1015
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:27,616
- A toadstool.
When I was at kindergarten.

1016
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,889
- And say you were now to play
the role of a Goddess

1017
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:36,529
who slits people's throats in a Temple,

1018
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,896
do you think you could manage?

1019
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:42,938
- Close you eyes sweetie and slit!

1020
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,692
- Well then, that's fine!

1021
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,816
You can go and get dressed!

1022
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,978
Open up the clamps!
That's right!

1023
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,972
Excellent work.
- So we saved that young actress's

1024
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,413
marriage.

1025
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,569
- Yes. Only that now
she'll have an astrologer

1026
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,457
for a husband
instead of a major.

1027
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,892
- Won't she be surprised when she finds

1028
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,448
that her husband knows a whole week
in advance what's to be for lunch.

1029
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,293
- Or with whom she'll be having
an affair next year,

1030
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,859
except that that'll be less pleasant
to know!

1031
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,499
- For him or for her?

1032
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,657
- Stop rattling on and breathe life
into the chap!

1033
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,292
Finished!
Yes.

1034
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,575
Well laddie, let's have a look at you!

1035
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,695
Mind! It's fresh!

1036
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,249
Where's M... Molly?

1037
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,976
Listen, Stuart Hample,
I just realized

1038
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:55,093
that you got yourself a really fine wife
and scot free!

1039
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,658
Well, Steiner, are you all right?

1040
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,617
- Y... yes.
- Excellent!

1041
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,019
Mind you're at the theatre in time,

1042
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,091
the King must disappear tonight
at any cost!

1043
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,654
- I beg your pardon?

1044
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,538
- But the King...
After all, it was your idea!

1045
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,418
- General, Mrs...

1046
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,374
...Keletti is perfectly all right
again.

1047
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,453
But now it's Mr. Ham... er... Steiner
who's stuttering for a change.

1048
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,656
- Never mind, Professor,
the main thing is he's alive!

1049
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,219
Thank you!

1050
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:40,210
Dear Evelina!

1051
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,650
I'd like to take you home to your villa
now, if you'll permit me.

1052
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,974
- Well knock me down
with a feather! I've even got

1053
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,209
a house!

1054
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,734
And who are you supposed to be?
Is this gold?

1055
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:56,217
- The actress in you will out! -
That voice, that elocution!

1056
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,770
- Elocution!
Elocution!

1057
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,176
Listen,
who was that Stubb woman actually?

1058
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,536
Good gracious, that's some barn!
- Barn!

1059
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,652
Evelina, you're a treasure!
A treasure!

1060
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,696
How many hidden facets your talent has!

1061
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:24,419
- What does this guy want?
- Excuse me.

1062
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,852
Before I leave the house
as the very last member

1063
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:28,929
of its former staff,

1064
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,817
I would like to tell you
one thing, General.

1065
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,455
I know nothing of this woman -

1066
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,815
but it is not she!

1067
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,013
Your deceased husband's secretary was
evidently crazy!

1068
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,534
- What if some damned fool barges in
on us again?

1069
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,848
- No, no, no, my dearest!

1070
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,257
We are alone at last!

1071
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,813
- That's fine!

1072
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,255
What about stretching out on the sofa?
- I beg your pardon?

1073
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,016
- Lie down!
- Gladly! Evelina, gladly!

1074
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:08,255
Come here, Evelina,
last time it was so madly...

1075
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,299
...so madly thrilling!

1076
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:13,417
Come, my angel, we'll be in paradise
in a minute!

1077
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,498
- Sure thing!

1078
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,457
Take that tie off so that I can get
at your neck!

1079
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:23,539
My neck!
Ah, I adore that!

1080
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,013
What's that - ticking?

1081
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,055
Close you eyes, baby!
- My beloved!

1082
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:55,453
Thi... thi... this is Hample,
Bobo!

1083
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,418
Come to the th... theatre at once!
There are c... conspirators there!

1084
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,616
But hu... hurry!

1085
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,494
What is it?!
- How on earth are you driving?!

1086
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,179
How on earth are you driving??!!

1087
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,815
Ah, it's madam!
- Where's there a theatre round here?

1088
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,972
I don't want to miss my cue -
I'm to slit some people's throats!

1089
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,369
Show me!
- You're right in front of the theatre!

1090
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,939
- That?

1091
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,016
- Hey! Hey!

1092
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:52,737
Miss Molly...
...or I should say Mrs. Steiner,

1093
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,897
your husband called - he's quite
all right again, and he'll be coming!

1094
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,219
- Thank you.
- She'll be my ruin!

1095
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,379
But when that Keletti comes I'll...
- Here she is!

1096
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,893
- Hell!
Stinking hell!

1097
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,698
- I was just saying that I was worried
you wouldn't be coming!

1098
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,814
- I'd have to be daft to miss
such an opportunity!

1099
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,413
Hey, don't touch!

1100
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,011
No sign of the stutter!

1101
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,539
But I think you have a slightly lower
timbre.

1102
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,416
So this is what I'm supposed to use
to finish the people with?

1103
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,099
- Listen, do hurry up
or you'll come on late! You'll miss it!

1104
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,740
- Your shoes!
- Look, kitty, I'll miss you...

1105
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:37,815
Joking apart, Evelina! And do hurry,
we're starting in a minute! Right?

1106
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,456
Where's Oatis?
- I have no idea, Your Highness.

1107
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,452
But he'll be sure to arrive
for the performance,

1108
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,895
he wouldn't miss Mrs. Keletti's
performance for the world today!

1109
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,410
They became engaged today!

1110
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,333
- Engaged to Oatis, that idiot?

1111
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,411
- That's how it is, Your Highness.

1112
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,332
That woman belongs
to the psychiatric ward

1113
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,012
not on stage!

1114
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:22,577
Where do I find this bird?
- On stage.

1115
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,450
- Just a tick!
Where's that?

1116
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,533
- Over there.

1117
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,570
So what?
- The column, it was there yesterday!

1118
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,254
- Really, and where?
- Here it is!

1119
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,813
Come on, chaps!
Come here!

1120
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,974
In that place where you say "The hour
of your death has arrived!"...

1121
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,620
- Yeah!
- ... draw out the pause, will you!

1122
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:20,929
And what's the ticking noise?

1123
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,976
- You'd do better to tell me
whose throats I'm to slit!

1124
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,528
Or doesn't it matter?
- How can you be in the mood

1125
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,576
for joking now? Really!
Go on!

1126
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,096
Madame...
- Now?

1127
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:32,410
You dare spit at me,
you pig!

1128
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:53,208
Let us turn to God, dear friends!

1129
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:55,731
This is the end!

1130
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,856
- I fear the worst,

1131
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,417
I have a feeling that John is dead!

1132
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,858
- No, John!
Dear God, you mustn't die!

1133
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:07,419
- Molly!

1134
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:11,972
- If you are dead,
I want to die with you!

1135
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,013
- That John is evidently hidden
inside that column!

1136
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,818
My goodness, how naive!

1137
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,410
- Quiet!
Here they come!

1138
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,655
The sun has hidden its countenance
behind mount Yve!

1139
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,418
- What?
- The hour of your death has arrived!

1140
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:46,658
You shall die!
- Me? Bullshit!

1141
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,618
Thirsty!

1142
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,018
Now you're supposed to say
"You shall die!", madam!

1143
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,933
- Ah!

1144
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:02,974
You shall die, Madame!
- No!

1145
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,409
- Ha, you wait and see!
You're in for a eye - opener, Missy!

1146
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,410
- An interesting conception...
- Very informal.

1147
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,168
- You mean to sacrifice us
to your Gods...

1148
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,010
- Curtain!

1149
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,571
- Reconsider!
- Enough!

1150
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,729
Curtain!

1151
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,048
- Stop screaming at me, you poor sap!
- Great Ra,

1152
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,290
the Sun God, thirsts for your blood.

1153
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,417
- That's good!
- He is also the God of Rainfall!

1154
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,418
- What does he send down?

1155
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,613
I see.

1156
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:34,412
In return for your blood
he will send down rain

1157
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:39,416
to dampen our ever- thirsting land!

1158
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,497
Stop gaping and get some beer!

1159
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,689
I thought this takes place in Egypt!

1160
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,531
- Maybe the stage director wanted
to express some new thought this way!

1161
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,179
- Hardly.

1162
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:54,973
What did the tickets cost us?

1163
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,369
- Nothing.
- And a good job, too.

1164
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,614
- Long live good old England!
- Stop!

1165
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,011
Goodbye, friends!

1166
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:08,449
- Let us proudly stand
and bear the thrust of the blade.

1167
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,211
- Ah!

1168
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:13,893
Not a drop of blood will be...

1169
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:18,059
Wasted!
- Hi!

1170
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,017
- Hi!
- Hi, Koko!

1171
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,013
- You... chump!

1172
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,610
You...!
- Koko!

1173
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:33,013
Come on, come on...!
Don't be stupid! Don't be stupid!!!

1174
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:37,530
Excuse us.

1175
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:40,180
- Koko, come on climb out
of that drum,...

1176
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,774
- But then it's not so bad as a comedy.

1177
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,498
- It's supposed to be a tragedy,
Your Highness!

1178
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:49,213
Out of the way!
- John!

1179
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,892
- What's up?
- Untie her!

1180
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,412
- Not blooming likely!

1181
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:56,499
- You'll die too,
and you'll be the first to die!

1182
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:00,449
- Oh, that one?
Come on, puss!

1183
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,895
- Untie those ropes!
- Come along!

1184
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,738
Throw that stuff away!

1185
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,576
There's a neck for you!

1186
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,257
Oh! Maestro!

1187
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:25,300
Close your eyes, sweetie!
- But Mrs. Keletti,...

1188
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:30,131
Good!
But a bit naturalistic.

1189
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,494
Didn't I say the woman is crazy?!

1190
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,300
She slit his throat
as if it were a chicken!

1191
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,733
Gugenhaim's dead, start out on plan "B"!

1192
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,650
Lights!
Lights!

1193
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:02,094
Where are we going chaps?

1194
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,291
Your Highness is all right?
- The King had disappeared!

1195
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,611
- They've abducted him!
- Don't panic!

1196
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,174
Don't panic!
- Let me go!

1197
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,933
That old hen in the hole down there
said he's to die first!

1198
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:16,295
So why did you drag me down here
in the first place?

1199
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:20,259
You... goons!
Are you all dumb or what?

1200
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,218
Hey!
- Just a moment, you are?

1201
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,693
- The sixth infantry regiment
from Ivancice.

1202
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,491
The King is at the given spot!

1203
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:33,411
- P... pardon?
- Plan "B" has come off!

1204
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:38,496
- What... what is "plan B" supposed
to be? I've f... forgotten.

1205
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,976
- But that was your idea!
The King is now...

1206
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:47,340
Where is the King?!
- D... don't be a nut, Bobo!

1207
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,058
I'm S... Stuart!

1208
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:51,489
And I was ju... just about to be to...
...told where the Ki... King is!

1209
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:54,858
- Sorry!
But how was I to know

1210
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,898
that you... er... moved again?

1211
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,977
- I f... forgot to te... tell you!

1212
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,493
- Robert!

1213
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,179
Robert!

1214
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,570
- Aren't you a lucky guy!

1215
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,496
Listen, actually Molly has both
Steiner and you now!

1216
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,857
- The s... stars don't lie, Bobo!

1217
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:20,013
- We're together at last!
Ale you glad?

1218
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:24,014
- Te... terribly glad!
The only thing I'd still like to know is

1219
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:28,094
"what plan "B" means!"
- You're an astrologer, aren't you...!

1220
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:42,213
An explosion, a bed!

1221
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:50,416
An explosion...

1222
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,854
A bed!
This is terrible!

1223
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:57,330
- But why is it terrible?

1224
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,179
- But...

1225
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:05,335
A b... bed! Do understand!
- Darling!

1226
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,339
What is it?

1227
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,774
"- Plan "B"!"

1228
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:15,010
"- What do you mean, plan "B", "
these are somebody's feet!

1229
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,013
There's a man in there!
- Q... quick!

1230
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,456
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

1231
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:29,778
- What idiot put me under the sheets?
Am I a hot water bottle or something!

1232
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,092
- Your Highness! Are you all right?

1233
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:37,331
- I suppose this was some conspiracy
again.

1234
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,978
Are you involved in this,
Steiner?!

1235
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,536
- I... I'm not S... S...
- Stop stuttering!

1236
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,372
What's the time?
We mustn't miss the fireworks!

1237
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,576
- Wh... what fireworks?

1238
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,412
- At midnight - to celebrate
the disbanding of my army.

1239
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,412
Flags, cannons banging,
a hundred and twenty bands!

1240
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:03,451
The money! And the pla... plane ticket
for South America! You promised!

1241
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,534
- Listen, Mrs. Keletti...

1242
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:09,373
- Shut up and look here,
if you don't mean to pay up

1243
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:12,896
all I have to do is whistle! -
Koko's waiting under the window!

1244
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,732
- She escaped from a loony- bin!

1245
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,771
- Come on then?!
Well, how long do I have to wait?!

1246
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,259
You said I was to fix one bloke,
didn't you...

1247
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,808
Well, I fixed two. -
Two!

1248
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,339
- Mrs. Keletti, you and I have finished!

1249
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:27,773
- Leave me alone you old geezer!

1250
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:29,691
- That's the Ki... King,
Mrs. S... Stubb!

1251
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:32,817
- Mrs. Stubb?
Have you all gone mad?

1252
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,819
Hush! There's something ticking
in here again!

1253
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,059
- Hush!

1254
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,419
That's...

1255
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,654
Koko!
- Steiner!

1256
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:47,253
- Robert!
- Stuart!

1257
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,451
- Robert!

1258
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:53,295
I hope she had a parachute,
Steiner!

1259
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:56,048
Your Hi .. Highness,
I'm no... not...

1260
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,577
The fireworks!

1261
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,654
You wait, you bitch,
I'll pull you apart!

1262
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:18,249
The end

1263
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,379
