{11495}{11559}Well, I apprenticed as a bookseller|after graduation,
{11677}{11749}I started selling books|as a bookseller
{11769}{11849}and I still sell books.
{11854}{11924}An easy curriculum vitae to write up!
{11939}{11999}I must show you my daughter.
{12015}{12079}Vrana's photos now!|- This is Ivana.

{14015}{14084}...I didn't recognize you!
{14087}{14149}Professor Prikryl,|please light the fire for us!
{14185}{14249}Right...
{14596}{14674}Look at Rudolph Vyskocil.|Practically failed at school.
{14736}{14799}And now this villa, this life.
{14811}{14874}I gave him hints, I wrote all|his compositions, and where am I now?
{14887}{14964}Sramek takes up this subject|"in this"Moon over the River"."
{14980}{15074}Understandably, it was not a matter|of money, rather, of ideals.
{15092}{15164}"A case of"tied wings"they call it."|You do remember, don't you?
{15220}{15289}Student Hlubina wanted to be a writer|too
{15333}{15399}and ended up owning a stationery shop.
{15438}{15499}What were your plans, Vrana?
{15518}{15589}I always liked women, Sir.|And that was my downfall.
{15602}{15664}Plenty of men like women, Vrana.
{15680}{15749}I like them more.|I have a morbid imagination, Sir.
{15858}{15934}A meet a woman|and immediately I see quite licidly
{16034}{16099}all the things I could do with her.|But terribly.
{16110}{16174}I thought it would end with puberty,|but it didn't.
{16184}{16259}You should try some therapy!|- I've been to a doctor.
{16280}{16349}- What did he say?|- That he has the same thing.
{16411}{16484}The bitches must know what I'm imagining|and they won't let me off.
{16560}{16634}I don't want to boast,|but they give me a hard time.
{16641}{16699}That must be rather nice!
{16714}{16774}Exept for the alimony.
{16788}{16869}Oh no, Mr. Professor,|It's no laughing matter. I'm forty,
{16876}{16949}I haven't been anywhere,|and I have nothing.
{16977}{17049}Each marriage left me plucked clean.|Just look at me - my visage.
{17091}{17159}You look fine.
{17176}{17249}No, I look like a waiter.
{17781}{17849}You're drenched.|They'll be looking for you.
{19042}{19109}I'm looking for you. Do talk to me.|Come on here...
{19179}{19249}Listen, I'm a passionate reader|and you are a bookseller...
{19273}{19339}You don't know yet that|I'm a passionate book - seller.
{19350}{19424}Is there another Hailey coming out?
{19450}{19504}I like his books.
{19525}{19599}We're expecting his Railway Station,|Post Office and Dormitory.
{19632}{19704}Great, give me a call.|If he writes Slaughter - House,
{19715}{19774}I'll get it for Rudi for Christmas.
{19780}{19849}I'll call you in any case.
{19860}{19924}We could perhaps|go our together.
{19940}{20019}If I don't have Slaughterhouse, we can|try at my friend's in Podebrady...
{20101}{20174}He has a larger shop.|- In Podebrady. But that's quite far.
{20210}{20279}I am sure you have a car.|- Of course, do you?
{20302}{20374}Yes.|- What make?
{20390}{20459}What would you guess at?
{20466}{20539}I should say you'd have...|- No, dont't try to guess. I have a Saab.
{20562}{20624}I don't see a Saab.
{20635}{20699}It's being repaired.|- I see...
{20712}{20774}...I came by train.
{20785}{20849}So no trip to Podebrady, pity.
{20887}{20949}Truly a pity.
{20960}{21024}People can be bribed.|The more you give the more you get.
{21059}{21134}I gave a travel agent 2,000|and he routes tourist tours to my place.
{21196}{21274}I make 20,000 on the deal.|Well, one must not be cheap.
{21365}{21438}If you're cheap, you stay poor.
{21447}{21519}That's a dish - washer, bam, bam, bam...|...fantastic.
{21581}{21649}You're not a waiter any more?
{21658}{21739}At times too, but as manager I'm a busy|man. I have to think of new trucks.
{21747}{21809}Wait a minute, I'll show you.
{21838}{21909}I wonder whether|you like it.
{22023}{22094}Take a drink of this.
{22157}{22224}Excellent, Cinzano...|- No, domestic vermouth.
{22270}{22339}You must serve it chilled,|and with lemon.
{22352}{22424}Not much diference in taste,|an enormous difference in price.
{22453}{22519}Do you dilute orange juice, too?
{22528}{22599}Of course, mustard too!
{22645}{22709}It rakes in thousands.
{22725}{22799}What's the money like in books?|- No money in books.

{97288}{97359}You'll go crazy|when you see each other.
{97399}{97464}Won't old Ramshackles stare.|- Who?
{97472}{97544}We call him Old Ramshackles. He drives|such a ramshackle three - wheeler.
{97565}{97634}But I don't see it here.|- Let's go some other time.
{97642}{97709}Is he not home?|Mrs. Paseka, Mrs. Paseka, excuse me,
{97716}{97784}Do you know if old Ramshackles is home?
{97801}{97874}Never mind,|I'll show you to his wife.
{97883}{97949}They must be crackers.
{97985}{98059}This'll be quite a shock for her.|- What's the good?
{98081}{98154}One of nature's quirks,|you're more alike than identical twins.
{98201}{98269}Why show me to some stranger?
{98275}{98324}See, she's out.|- Stand here. I'll hide.
{98400}{98469}Forgotten your keys?
{98475}{98549}Come here, Mrs. Vrana.|Introduce yourself.
{98592}{98659}Good afternoon, I am John Kralik.
{98668}{98734}What are you up to?
{98741}{98809}I'm Kralik.|- Christ,
{98830}{98899}as drunk as this in the middle|of the day? How dare you!
{98905}{98974}What do you mean?|- Thanks for bringing him home.
{98980}{99049}But he isn't your husband.
{99054}{99124}I know.|Your wife'll be pleased with you too.
{99134}{99204}Daddy!|- A nice little boy. What's his name?
{99225}{99299}I'm too busy for such dumb jokes.
{99314}{99384}What did I tell you?|Pity old Ramshackles didn't see.
{99425}{99484}Let's go.
{99668}{99734}Is the dormitora out yet?
{99810}{99874}You, Manuella?
{99890}{99959}I don't want him,|nor his villa with fountain.
{99996}{100054}I find him repulsive.
{100087}{100154}I wouldn'n mind sharing one tiny room
{100186}{100249}with somebody I loved.
{100287}{100354}Manuela, I am afraid,
{100374}{100449}I'm not the pauper you are looking for.
{100497}{100574}I have a villa too.|- I know.
{100597}{100674}I saw you come back|for that canvas three - wheeler.
{100726}{100799}You saw me?
{100835}{100899}I saw you play around|with that little bitch, too.
{100922}{100999}If she has puppies,|I'll have one!
{101093}{101149}How I hate him.
{101165}{101229}He buys meat for dogs!
{101254}{101324}What for?|- Cooks it for people.
{101329}{101399}A bucket - ful for a pew pence -
{101407}{101474}and serves it as steak.
{101501}{101559}Darling, I want you.
{101579}{101634}Excuse me.
{101744}{101784}Please.
{101821}{101889}Manuella, Rudolph and I|sat at one desk together.
{101931}{101994}I know, in the last row, by the wall.
{102010}{102074}I can't do that to him.
{102123}{102189}Do it to him.
{102282}{102349}God, where are my good intentions?
{102386}{102454}Any salt around?
{102566}{102634}At last, soup, ham,
{102657}{102724}a steak and wine.
{102733}{102804}Ninety - seven.|- Thanks, that's all right.
{102871}{102949}Is it warm|in that cubby - hole of yours?
{103047}{103114}I've got an electric...
{103154}{103224}Eat up, quick.|- Would you like to pay, Sir?
{103229}{103299}No, I have paid,|or do I pay twice?
{103313}{103389}Who collected it?|- Your colleague.
{103403}{103474}I'm the head waiter here!|- He's been here!
{103490}{103559}You'd better explain,|this phantom waiter -
{103565}{103639}a unique local custom.
{103661}{103724}What did he say?
{103735}{103804}A unique local custom,
{103840}{103909}in addition to the normal waiter...
{103943}{103999}...an abnormal one.
{104017}{104084}Unbelievable.
{104105}{104174}What a coincidence!|Mr. Kralik again!
{104180}{104249}Bumping into each other all the time.|- Good evening.
{104255}{104328}He was up to his tricks|in the mountains,
{104340}{104404}and we were there,|he's up to his tricks here and -
{104443}{104509}isn't that a coincidence?
{104520}{104594}Golden Prague, yeah.
{104662}{104729}Goodbye.|- See you.
{104738}{104814}Hoarse, are you?|Yep all of a sudden.
{105894}{105964}Pst, come here... careful, there...|...over there.
{107832}{107904}He's running down - river!
{107910}{107984}Who? The fake waiter!
{108000}{108074}Running past your place!|The fake waiter!
{111010}{111084}Friends, he may have escaped us.
{111126}{111199}But it is also possible|that he is here amongst us!
{111272}{111344}I suggest that nobody leaves.
{111427}{111499}One of us must fetch the police.
{111520}{111589}Let them check on us all!
{111595}{111669}That's right!|Pazout, you go, we all know you!
{111697}{111769}I've had it.|He thought of it, let him go!
{111775}{111849}Thank you for your trust,|I hope you'll not disappoint me.
{111917}{111989}Thank you, sorry, excuse me,|yes, I'll be back in a flash.
{112033}{112099}Stand here, don't let anybody in
{112132}{112199}till the police arrives.
{113093}{113164}What is this here, what is up?|Gentlement, hey-ho, get up and pay,
{113208}{113274}here, yes, here...
{113292}{113364}Yes, I am here, everything is all right,|right, let us start here,
{113390}{113459}yes, thank you, thank you...
{113467}{113534}The place is packed full.|Don't you know me.
{113619}{113689}Quiet! Does anybody know him?|The guy who just left?
{113860}{113929}See, no-one. It must be him.|Let's get him!
{114995}{115059}Have you any idea what you have committed?|- I know. An offence.
{115070}{115124}Atraffic offence.|- A serious traffic offence.
{115130}{115199}What are you thinking of?|If you knew, comrade,
{115205}{115274}what I am thinking of,|you'd be promoted.
{115282}{115324}I'd be what?
{115335}{115399}When you see Vrana,
{115405}{115474}you'll know what Kralik looks like.
{115496}{115564}Round the corner.
{116333}{116408}Do you have a plan?|- I'll report it.
{116550}{116624}Yes?
{116650}{116724}Douchova, you're crazy!|One sends you to the post office...
{116813}{116889}Mr. Vrana, I have to tell you something.|- What?
{116937}{117009}Not here. Could we go upstairs?
{117111}{117184}All right, tell me.
{117247}{117314}Mr. Vrana, I went to the post office...|- And.
{117322}{117389}...then to the a hairdresser's...|- And.
{117397}{117469}...then I... bought some clothes...|glasses and now I want to tell you
{117526}{117599}that I love you.
{117730}{117799}Douchova, come on, what...
{117815}{117874}Put that mousey dust - coat on again,|twist your hair into a bun,
{117890}{117960}I can't afford a love affair,|come on.
{117960}{118024}I know,|I found her hair around.
{118035}{118099}A momentary lapse.|I've finished with all that.
{118105}{118174}As you know, I have different interests,|Now I play the violin and such.
{118180}{118269}You must give it up. That police man|had a strange look in his face.
{118275}{118349}Mr. Vrana,|I know you're the fake waiter.
{118398}{118449}Douchova!
{118473}{118544}Mr. Vrana, If you don't stop,|I'll go to the police,
{118551}{118624}because the sooner I do,|the sooner you'll be out of prison.
{118800}{118874}Wait, Douchova...|Iook, sit down...
{118953}{119024}Libby... What are you doing,|where are you going?
{119080}{119149}You've never called me Libby.
{119155}{119224}But I'm married!
{119230}{119299}Dalibor.|- Aauuch!
{119675}{119744}What can I get you?
{119751}{119824}I seem to have forgotten. My head.
{119857}{119924}My greetings.
{119932}{119999}Libby my girl,|you wanted to turn me in?
{120007}{120074}Because I love you.
{120085}{120149}I've remembered.|- Yes.
{120226}{120299}Hands Up. A good thriller, I hear.
{120318}{120384}Up there somewhere.
{120473}{120559}Sorry, that's Winnie - the - Pooh|- Never mind, I'll take it.
{120567}{120624}But that's not a thriller,
{120642}{120699}it's kids'stuff.
{120718}{120784}The donkey with the stolen tail.|- Never mind, I'll take it.
{120866}{120934}Ok... Winnie-the-Pooh,|Hands Up too?
{120947}{121014}Hands Up too.
{121022}{121089}Here it is, here you go,
{121100}{121174}So it's Hands Up, Winnie-the-Pooh,|sounds funny together, ha?
{121260}{121334}That's eighty - nine seventy, Sir.
{121455}{121524}Anything wrong?
{121550}{121624}On the contrary.
{121650}{121724}Come with me, Mr. Vrana.
{122080}{122149}There is no use, Libby.
{122300}{122409}With shoes falling apart,|by gold fever I'm struck
{122430}{122534}I'm poor, I'm weak, and I am ill!
{122573}{122684}My head is ablaze,|and in a distant blueish haze
{122700}{122809}glistens and shines my sweet dream.
{122830}{122934}Where the land's hushed by snow,|where only wolfs' footprints show
{122965}{123074}no post-ofice, no letters, just cold.
{123101}{123199}Alone, in a shack of pine,|I'll dream that dream of mine,
{123236}{123334}that dream of the nuggets of gold.
{123380}{123484}Severe are the winds of the North,
{123515}{123614}that is my dear love a fact
{123649}{123734}I'll bring you boullions of gold,
{123750}{123849}or I may never come back.
{124768}{124829}You, Rudolph?
{124843}{124914}So we'll be sitting together again.
{125000}{125109}I've grown a long beard|and the wolves are coming near
{125143}{125252}I now hear their howling approach.
{125272}{125374}The're after my scent|and know that I'll soon descend
{125396}{125499}into the shallow grave marked|with a cross.
{125535}{125639}Here lies that silly fool,|who wanted a house and a pool
{125672}{125764}and left your beautiful face.
{125799}{125904}He has a tin little mug|and of gold nothing but dust
{125932}{126039}and the Northern Lights shine|over his grave.
{126070}{126169}Severe are the winds of the North,
{126200}{126299}that is my dear love a fact
{126325}{126409}I'll bring you boullions of gold,
{126425}{126514}or I may never come back.
