WINTER 1967
in-between times

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,558
It was Christmas 1967.
I was about to turn sixteen.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,309
I was hopelessly in love
and I wanted to die.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,674
Come on Boris.
The girls are cold.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,473
- This way. This is great.
- Open it.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,039
- Tamara!
- Wait a minute.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,554
- Take care.
- Thank you very much.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,318
- All the best.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,034
- This is for you.
- Come on Boris, hurry up.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,517
- Thank you Boris.
- Come on, let's go...

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,148
I give the Bolsheviks one year.
Two at the most.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,759
Hello.

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,353
- What're you doing?
- Merry Christmas.

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,033
Are you nuts?

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,191
How can you be so cruel?

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,596
How can you be so cold?

22
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,313
I bought here guitar because
of you

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,195
And spent each cent of
daddy's heard earned pay

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,153
And thought the work to make it
wasn't through

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,759
I already knew the song
I'd like to play

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,039
Bro...

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,993
Mom, my brother's dead!

35
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,875
Mom, he's not moving. It's true,
Dad. Mom, he's dead...

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,477
You idiot!

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,158
- You have nothing to do today?
- I got you again.

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
You won't be pissing me off
for long, you bastard.

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,793
Speaking. I read you.

40
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,918
Roger. Give me extension 205.

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,435
Put it on.

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,359
It's major Sebek speaking,
get the menu ready!

43
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,759
What menu? I didn't say that.

44
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,837
- You said it.
- You made a mistake.

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,590
Okay, I made a mistake. I'm
preparing a menu for the kids...

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,316
Get the reports ready.
Over and out.

47
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,478
- What's for lunch today?
- Stop screaming and go read it.

48
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,676
Are we having
tomato sauce again?

49
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
- What do you see?
- Chicken.

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,470
So you see.

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,035
This is ridiculous.

52
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,152
His family destroys
an architectural work

53
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,352
and replaces it with a tank!

54
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,108
Do five more for me.

55
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,149
One... two... three...

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,755
Five...

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,395
- Jindra!
- Six...!

58
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,193
Seven... I said ten!

59
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,710
- You said five.
- I said five but I meant ten.

60
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,880
Come on, slowly.

61
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,955
Do you know that one man had the
hiccups for 13 straight years?

62
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,598
Come on, girls...

63
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,715
Hello!

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,957
- Hi, aunt.
- At school call me teacher.

65
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,798
Comrade teacher.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,434
Tell your parents we'll come
visit the day after tomorrow.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,596
- What time should I come?
- Come at three.

68
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,277
Will you be
alone for Christmas?

69
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,188
Not really. I have
a projector and a piano.

70
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,919
- Otherwise it sucks here.
- Thanks for the compliment.

71
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,600
You have a package from America.

72
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,357
- It's from your parents, huh?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,476
They're awesome.

74
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,512
Nice boots.
They'd look good on my mom.

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,754
You're full of shit.
Look at your shoes.

76
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,439
Come on in!

77
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,359
Do you have a ticket?

78
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,196
- Elien looks like Jean Marais.
- I hope this one'll be better.

79
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,715
It's so cool
that they show this.

80
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,554
Did you know
Jean Marais likes boys?

81
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,353
- Really?
- He's kidding.

82
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,677
You mentioned the resemblance...

83
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,078
- You mean Elien is...
- A fagot... gay...

84
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,519
Quiet!

85
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,594
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,318
- So I look like Jean Marais?
- Jirina said that.

87
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,269
I told you not to bike on ice,
but you didn't listen.

88
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,234
They were kissing, kissing
for so damn long!

89
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,837
Why are you running
in the house.

90
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,868
Didn't I tell you to get
a haircut for Christmas?

91
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,839
- It's like Aesop's hair.
- Esau's dad.

92
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,439
Him too.

93
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,715
Go and vacuum!
Don't just hang around!

94
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,792
Let me help you.

95
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,432
- Why isn't aunt Eva coming?
- She'll come on Christmas Day.

96
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,909
- She has a visitor today.
- Comrade teacher?

97
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,031
Damn, I hope it fits now...

98
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,836
Yes, comrade teacher.

99
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,800
Love is fatal disease

100
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,670
Each has his own
heart's ease

101
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:57,118
Listen to how I myself
found release

102
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,951
Merry Christmas!
One moment, please.

103
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,914
- Pet'a, hurry up.
- It's occupied.

104
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,199
For how long?

105
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,357
A while.

106
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,432
It's free.

107
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,228
- What stinks in here?
- The heather. Just my luck.

108
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:08,035
Jesus Christ was born,
let us be merry

109
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:17,635
the bud bloomed into a rose,
let us enjoy it.

110
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:28,237
Of pure life, of royal family

111
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,514
he was born for us...

112
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,715
He was born for us...
She's smiling. See?

113
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,192
She's smiling!

114
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,199
And if they splashed boiling
oil in my face she'd be what?

115
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,753
She'd be smiling!

116
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,836
And it's actually so simple.

117
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,512
It was supposed to be a C minor
but what did we hear instead?

118
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,872
The butcher smiles in spite
of her sub-normal intelligence

119
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,232
and hangs out with a local freak
right under her father's eyes.

120
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,955
You could beat her to death,
and still she'd play...

121
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,157
And it's actually so simple.

122
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,119
Jesus Christ was born...

123
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,595
He was born for us!

124
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,798
- I don't have an ear for music!
- My own blood doesn't hear it?

125
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,275
Your mother
and I have perfect pitch!

126
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,757
You do it on purpose!
Play it again!

127
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,317
- Are you feeling better today?
- Yes. Don't worry. It's okay.

128
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,352
- It's better today.
- I think I said something!

129
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,433
Saboteurs.

130
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,919
- We bring you news...
- Mom.

131
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,713
- Hi.
- Welcome.

132
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,710
- Boza.
- Oh please, give it to me.

133
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,950
Come on, young man.

134
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,555
- Sing a carol for us.
- Jesus Christ was born...

135
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,353
Shut up. Can't you at least stop

136
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,550
these political provocations
at Christmas.

137
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,515
- No betting today, guys.
- Vaclav! Grandma!

138
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,830
My beloved sister in law.

139
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,798
- Where's your sister?
- She'll come tomorrow.

140
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,631
- She has a serious date tonight.
- Thank God she has a man!

141
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,675
- A biology teacher!
- A biology teacher!

142
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,109
- You are absolutely radiant.
- Really? I feel completely...

143
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,912
Come have a look.

144
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,191
For God sake, take it out.

145
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,675
Wait, calm down!
I'll take it out.

146
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,509
You always get me!
What a Christmas...

147
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,993
Wait. Take your shoes off here!
We have a new carpet.

148
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,395
- It's Christmas Eve.
- Shut up. Take your shoes off.

149
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,910
- Did you get these at work?
- No way. They're brand new.

150
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,472
You see brother.
He's a biology teacher.

151
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,034
He will explain that four
meter tall bear to you.

152
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,713
I'm just saying what the TV said.
A kodiak bear is 3.7 meters tall.

153
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,752
- Will you have a shot?
- Sure.

154
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,030
Three meters seventy...

155
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,437
Three meters seventy.
That's like an African elephant!

156
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,994
- So what?
- Boys, please...

157
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,351
You can't believe
everything they say on TV.

158
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,591
I just said that they said
it rises on its hind legs

159
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,598
and measures three meters
seventy. Maybe more!

160
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,349
Don't believe the hype.
I'm one meter eighty five.

161
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,268
- I'm one eighty three. So what?
- Get on my back.

162
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,518
- Stop it.
- Try to touch the ceiling.

163
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,712
Try it and when you touch it,

164
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,876
we will see how big
your kodiak bear is.

165
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,154
Watch out. The kodiak is coming.
I'll climb up. Hold on to this.

166
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,074
Okay. Be careful. Wait...

167
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,197
Now I have to get on you
somehow.

168
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,630
You gotta get on
your back legs...

169
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,558
You're the back legs,
I'm raising my front paws.

170
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,111
Stand still. Be careful.
I'm going up.

171
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,151
- Come on, idiot.
- Jesus.

172
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,838
Make a mark there.

173
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,874
How am I supposed
to make a mark?

174
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,994
- Use your claw.
- He's nuts. Jesus...

175
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,998
Uzlinka, hand me a fork.

176
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,838
- Growl dad.
- What did you say?

177
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,918
- Growl.
- I'll show you once I get down.

178
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,349
Hand it to me carefully
so you don't get hurt.

179
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,637
- I got it. I'll make a mark.
- Didn't you already have enough?

180
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,593
- Quit staring and measure it.
- And the magic word?

181
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,517
- Excuse me?
- The magic word!

182
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,996
I'll kill you, you bastard.

183
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,152
Hold on.

184
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

185
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,430
- What's up?
- Elien is sorry.

186
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,435
Every year's the same.

187
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,553
- He admitted he went too far.
- It's okay.

188
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,868
He's sending you this
to make up for it.

189
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,037
Thanks.

190
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,235
Jindriska!
We haven't poured the lead yet!

191
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,558
- Lead's dead.
- We're measuring a bear.

192
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,872
- See you.
- Merry Christmas.

193
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,878
Damn women! Don't touch me!

194
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,911
Am I at the sink yet?

195
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,556
What can you see, Jindrich?

196
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:34,075
I give the Bolsheviks one year.
Two at the most.

197
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,797
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

198
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,914
- Don't you think it's magic?
- I do.

199
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,439
Look.

200
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,351
I love glass.

201
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,797
I always wanted a paperweight.

202
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,029
- It's not just a paperweight.
- What is it then?

203
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,991
A kodiak bear...

204
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,715
I heard one man had the hiccups
for 13 straight years.

205
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,388
Can't you hold your breath
for a little while?

206
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,551
As a boy I could stay under
water for a minute and a half.

207
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,470
Under water. You can't breathe
through the skin and pores.

208
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,558
- Stop it!
- It's a piece of cake.

209
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,549
Pet'a said that pearl divers can
stay under water for 15 minutes.

210
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,194
Come on, that's impossible.

211
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,629
- Why not?
- Fifteen minutes?

212
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,912
- Sure.
- You can't even last a minute.

213
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,555
Why couldn't I last a minute?

214
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,356
- Come on, boys.
- Well? Let's try it.

215
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,199
From now on I won't argue,
I'll bet.

216
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,513
- One crown for every second.
- Okay.

217
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,033
Anything under a minute is yours,
anything over is mine. Deal?

218
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,033
Let's go.

219
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,030
- Three, two, one...
- You have to follow me.

220
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,517
- Okay, you say it.
- Ready, steady, go!

221
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,357
- Finished?
- Not yet.

222
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,155
Not at all. Hold your nose!
Plug your nostrils.

223
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,716
Okay, I'll plug my nose.
It's not such a big deal.

224
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,072
Ready, steady, go!

225
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,111
He's breathing.

226
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,594
I can hear him breathe.

227
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,232
He's breathing.

228
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,917
I can see it. I can hear it. I'm
not timing you. You can breathe.

229
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,430
I'm finished. It's off.
I'm not timing you.

230
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,876
He's getting red.

231
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,354
Come on, brother. A blood vessel
in your brain might burst.

232
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,713
You're not young anymore.
You'll crumple like a leaf.

233
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,952
He's a dumb ass.

234
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,671
- He'd be willing to kill himself.
- How long did he last?

235
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,276
- No good. He isn't under water.
- What do you mean?

236
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,552
- It's like biking down a hill.
- What do you mean?

237
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,196
- You don't need to peddle!
- Do you peddle under water?

238
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,430
- What's under the tree?
- I wished for a crossbow.

239
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,949
Oh no, a crossbow?

240
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,352
Let's go to the bathroom!

241
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,353
Excuse me, little girl.

242
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,117
Boys!

243
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,270
Excuse me, bigger girl.

244
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,195
You see. He isn't breathing.

245
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,434
One minute one second.
I owe you a crown!

246
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,032
That was incredible, man!
You're an amphibian!

247
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,836
What did you make for dinner?
The carp is still in the tub!

248
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,873
I bought one already sliced
two days ago.

249
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,154
You mean you can kill the carp?
Your dad isn't around anymore.

250
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,398
You can't, huh?

251
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:53,397
Let's remember those who can't
be at our Christmas table.

252
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,830
Let's sit in silence and pray
for those who died in the war

253
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,436
and for my tortured friends
from the resistance movement.

254
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,836
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name

255
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,111
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

256
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,392
On earth as it is in heaven

257
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,715
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses

258
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,115
As we forgive those
Who trespass against us...

259
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,117
Amen.

260
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,717
Amen.

261
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,750
Enjoy your meal.

262
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,791
Merry Christmas!

263
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,799
Uzlinka!

264
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,752
A crossbow!

265
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,593
- Who gave it to her?
- Santa Claus.

266
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,712
He still uses
the same wrapping paper.

267
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,719
I wonder what this is, mom.

268
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,231
- You know what it is.
- No, I don't.

269
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:10,195
Oh boy!
Genuine Stolichnaya vodka!

270
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,231
- Don't open it now!
- Is it from Uncle Boris?

271
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,555
The tree holder's from Uncle
Boris. He'll be back in summer.

272
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,834
I wonder what this is.

273
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,558
Thanks, dad.

274
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,592
Thanks, dad.

275
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,870
Pretty good, huh?

276
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,834
This is something
for mom from dad.

277
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,037
- Drinking glasses?
- Go ahead. Shake it.

278
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:58,308
We needed these badly!
Ours are already broken.

279
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,594
That's right.
Ours are already broken.

280
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,910
Did you notice anything
unusual about these glasses?

281
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,395
- They're light.
- This is...

282
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,790
This is not funny.

283
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,709
Just watch, you heckler!

284
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:36,269
What happens when you drop
an ordinary glass on the floor?

285
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,359
- It breaks.
- Exactly. It breaks.

286
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:47,160
An ordinary glass will break.
That's how it used to be.

287
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,070
But then a couple of smart guys
got together...

288
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,835
Stop grinning!

289
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:09,037
It's no coincidence that
they all came from Poland.

290
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,436
- Socialist Poland!
- I see.

291
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,678
Madam Curie-Sklodowska, or
Glass-ska came from Poland.

292
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,759
Well...

293
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,036
- It's unbreakable glass.
- What do you mean?

294
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,951
It's a miracle.

295
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,438
Can I try it?

296
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,399
Lida!

297
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,119
- How hard can I smash it?
- Go all the way, girl!

298
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,074
The glassmakers
won't have anything to eat.

299
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,393
Granny...

300
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,513
It means we're one step
ahead of them!

301
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,275
- How did you like the test?
- It wasn't hard enough.

302
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,557
You think so?

303
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,238
Okay then. Go ahead, big man!

304
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,358
Who do you think you're helping?

305
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,596
The other side?

306
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:43,953
Did you notice the weird shards?

307
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,476
They're round like flowers,
and don't cut you!

308
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,276
Really. I've never seen
anything like that.

309
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,114
This is strange. It's four of us
at the table all year around,

310
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,629
and we've got five of them.

311
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,033
It means one try
for everybody, right?

312
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,148
HOLD ON, PIONEER!

313
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,989
- What is it?
- It's a very interesting thing.

314
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,796
I bought it during
a fellowship in Kiev.

315
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,433
- Do you know Kiev?
- Yes, I do.

316
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,632
It's a beautiful city.
Everything is new.

317
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,911
That's where I got this thing
"Hold on, pioneer. "

318
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,519
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

319
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,829
It's a toy that makes boys
like you over there stronger.

320
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,753
It hurts!

321
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,312
- Are you okay Pet'a?
- It just numbs you a bit.

322
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,151
The object and fun of the game
is to hold on. Turn it on!

323
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,114
Turn it on,
grit you teeth and hold on.

324
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,796
Why are you shaking so much?

325
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,629
Because electric power's
running inside me.

326
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,990
- So let go of it.
- I can't.

327
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,476
Electric power's running in me.
The boy has to turn it off.

328
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,308
- Turn it off, Pet'a.
- Turn it off for a minute.

329
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,679
Turn it off!

330
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,475
- Well...?
- I don't think it's a safe toy.

331
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,991
I'm a biology teacher, I know
what I can take. Come try it.

332
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,315
- I don't want to.
- Take it. It's fun.

333
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,829
- I just grab it. Turn it on.
- But not too much!

334
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,520
He can turn it all the way up,
it doesn't matter.

335
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,350
- It's not doing anything.
- It can't. We're not touching.

336
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,035
The bodies are touching...
Blooming in May...

337
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,678
- Exciting, huh?
- It hurts.

338
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,471
It's beautiful, Vilma!
I don't deserve such a thing.

339
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,638
But the gift that brings
the most happiness

340
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,834
is one made by a man himself.

341
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,118
That's right. It's for me?

342
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,958
Thank you, Jindrich.
Jack of all trades, right?

343
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,752
Is it a dog?

344
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,872
- It's a camel!
- Where did you learn this?

345
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,594
At camp during the war.

346
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,829
I even made bread chess once.

347
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:05,390
- From white and black bread?
- No from soggy war rations!

348
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,714
You are looking
at the origins of life.

349
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,437
It began here and its apex is
our existence. It's a miracle!

350
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,235
I've got Gott's 45! Come on.

351
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,197
- Something really stinks here.
- Frankincense.

352
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,756
Come on, frankincense
can't smell that bad.

353
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,032
- Are you nuts?
- Screwing is for kids.

354
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,957
Men will drink! Right?

355
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,998
- Now something stinks here.
- Drop it, mother.

356
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,229
I'll show you something
you've never seen before.

357
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,113
For God Sake, Bohous...
Stop it!

358
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:37,319
Quiet! Do you know what
soldiers in a trench do

359
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,319
when they need to warm up...

360
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,876
- What?
- Does anybody know?

361
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:57,235
They... name... bullets...
individually...

362
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,148
- Name bullets individually?
- What?

363
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,795
You won't do that.

364
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,999
- Marshall Malinovsky!
- Brother.

365
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,472
- Dad!
- What?

366
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,393
You're the man!

367
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,875
Hands up!

368
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,468
I promote you to the position
of poster of bulletins.

369
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,193
- Let's have a drink.
- Later.

370
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,793
Let's light the frankincense.
Just for the smell...

371
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,029
- Is doing it on Christmas O.K.?
- Yes, it is.

372
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,472
You're my best present, Eva.
I'm going to unwrap you.

373
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,636
Raise your hands...

374
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,199
Bend forward...

375
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,196
Come on... sit down.

376
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,071
- I'll take your shoes off first.
- Wait. Give me that shoe!

377
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,159
Now the other shoe.
Shoes, beautiful legs...

378
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,716
Do you see it, Eva?
Do you like it?

379
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,356
Take it in your hands
and just feel the energy.

380
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,438
- I don't want it.
- Come on, take it.

381
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,269
I'm praying on my knees.
Feel the energy.

382
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,072
And now your earring
like icing on a cake.

383
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,519
- Isn't this exciting?
- I don't know. I feel sick.

384
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,478
- Mom...
- Yes!

385
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,309
Hurry! Turn the light off!

386
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,588
- Teacher, can I ask something?
- Yes.

387
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,995
- Does shit burn?
- Pet'a!

388
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,029
- What's he saying?
- Does shit burn?

389
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,274
Camel shit does,
for example. It's true.

390
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,356
It's true.
Do you know what time it is?

391
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,357
- What time is it?
- It's late.

392
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,234
We said we would always
choose dads together.

393
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,069
Go to bed or I'll take away
your microscope

394
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,749
and you'll get it back at
the end of the school year!

395
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,677
Don't look at me and go!

396
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,155
Good night. Be a good boy.

397
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,875
So I'm being interviewed
for the position of father.

398
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,518
I'm making a nice Christmas Eve
for the incomplete family.

399
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,633
I'm making fiction, some kind
of illusion for the boy,

400
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,231
a sixth-grader
who is going to judge me.

401
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,515
He will decide whether we can
spend a couple of hours in bed.

402
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,510
I came
with the offer of quality sex.

403
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,071
Bamboo chopping...
the milk & water position...

404
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,228
Long hours of homework all
in vain. All because of your...

405
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,036
- Good night.
- Come on, Sasa.

406
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,469
- Don't force yourself.
- I'm not forcing myself.

407
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,830
Just be quiet and quick, please.

408
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,710
- Eva...
- Quickly.

409
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,479
- Are you sure you want it?
- I'm sure.

410
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,718
- You know, Eva...
- Ouch! -Sorry!

411
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,796
- It's okay.
- You make me infinitely happy.

412
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,592
That's good, Sasa.

413
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,234
- I'll be quiet, don't worry.
- Quiet and quick.

414
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,952
Eva...

415
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,438
What is it?

416
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,874
Damn it! I've had enough of
this. This is pissing me off...

417
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,108
Mom!

418
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,677
I will...

419
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,111
Who's this ugly hippie here?

420
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,990
You mean Gagarin's brother?

421
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,919
I wanted to pass
the bulletin board on to you.

422
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,631
You bastard!

423
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,155
- How high is it, doctor?
- Higher than last time.

424
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,636
We've got to do something about
your blood pressure.

425
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,672
Two or three days
at our clinic would help.

426
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,233
I can't do that.

427
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,714
- Are you taking those pills?
- Sometime I forget.

428
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,071
You mustn't.
They're very important.

429
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,672
Let's have something stronger
before lunch, professor.

430
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:58,156
I have 12 year old, 60 % plum
brandy from doctor Vacenovsky.

431
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,190
- Vilma, have a thimbleful.
- Mrs. Vilma can't drink.

432
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,312
- But professor...
- Her blood pressure is too high.

433
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,512
- I'll drink for mom.
- This isn't eggnog, young lady.

434
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,553
This is a man's drink! Do you
actually know how to drink this?

435
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:27,351
First, you raise the glass.
You can smell the pit.

436
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,952
You have to suck in...

437
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,191
The pain!

438
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,798
Are you trying to kill me,
you bastards? Get up!

439
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,915
You're dismissed! Both of you!

440
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,469
- Well?
- What?

441
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,590
How about that teacher of yours?

442
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,077
I don't know.

443
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,190
He's slimy, isn't he?

444
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,155
Yeah.
Pet'a doesn't like him either.

445
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,391
- Can we play that new record?
- You better not.

446
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,193
- Auntie...
- Of course you can. -Thanks!

447
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,676
Will Bohous mind?

448
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,595
Let's have someone else
yell here for a while.

449
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,995
I might put an ad in the paper.

450
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,874
- An ad?
- Pet'a needs a father.

451
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,719
Come on, Eva...

452
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,990
Walk without a hunched back
and it'll happen.

453
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,516
Thank you.

454
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,279
We always have pork with sauce
and dumplings on Christmas Day.

455
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,554
Right, Vilma? Professor
has always had seconds.

456
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,193
I like it very much.

457
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,788
- Can we begin? Bon Appetit.
- You too.

458
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,631
The sauce curdled a bit somehow.
It's not really perfect.

459
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,871
- No way. It's delicious.
- It's been better before.

460
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,755
A good housewife
is always unsatisfied.

461
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,952
That's true. It's delicious!

462
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,718
Aren't the dumplings
a bit mushy?

463
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,232
Gnocchi should have
a slightly mushy surface.

464
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,474
Did I hear you right?
Did you say gnocchi?

465
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,955
Yeah, mom's gnocchi.

466
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,915
Gnocchi have a slimy surface
and are light and fluffy inside.

467
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,831
Are you sure you didn't mean
mom's delicious dumplings?

468
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,589
I'm talking about
mom's delicious gnocchi.

469
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:59,592
You mean these true and only
Viennese potato dumplings?

470
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,950
How do you dare to call them...

471
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,038
- Gnocchi!
- Dumplings!

472
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,276
Let me explain the difference
between dumplings and gnocchi.

473
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,757
Dumplings are long cylindrical
shapes cooked in boiling water,

474
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,112
then cut into thin slices
after being taken out of water.

475
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,950
Therefore, dumpling slices
are slimy only on the edges.

476
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,038
On the other hand,
typical gnocchi

477
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,951
are made into little balls and
each piece is cooked separately.

478
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,949
Therefore, it's slimy
on the whole surface.

479
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,032
It seems pretty logical to me.

480
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,869
Vilma! How did you cook
these dumplings?

481
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,478
In steam, wrapped in a napkin.

482
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,716
Well, what do you have
to say about that?

483
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,958
- Gnocchi can be steamed, right?
- Yes, they can.

484
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,434
If you don't know how to treat
your father in front of guests

485
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,358
then get out off my sight!

486
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,232
Can I finish chewing
my last gnocchi?

487
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,193
Leave the last dumpling
and get out!

488
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,834
Maybe I made dumplings
and I ended up with gnocchi.

489
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,829
It's a disgusting excuse!

490
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,318
You, chef from a five-star hotel,
don't know what you're serving.

491
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,389
You might not know it,
but I'd never dine on

492
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,751
anything as disgusting
as gnocchi!

493
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,192
How dare you talk about
mother's cuisine like this?

494
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:44,077
Don't you know what a typical
Viennese potato dumpling is?

495
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,031
- Gnocchi!
- Dumplings!

496
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,559
- Come on, Jindra!
- Calm down, mom!

497
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,754
My priest taught me to respect
my mother and father,

498
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,668
and this is the result of the
materialistic way of upbringing.

499
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,678
Choke on those gnocchi!

500
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:10,757
This is my house and nothing,
not even that dumpling, is yours.

501
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,429
This is your fault. This is the
result of your poor rearing!

502
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,989
I should have brought her up!

503
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,317
But I wouldn't be able to leave
the house for even a second!

504
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,558
I'd have to be here with a whip
from sunrise to sunset!

505
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,993
You think I haven't noticed
you whispering:

506
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:37,753
"Quick before dad comes. "
This is just unbearable!

507
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:44,519
I let these vipers into my heart.
I mean a whole nest of vipers!

508
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,315
- Leave me alone!
- Come on, we have a visitor.

509
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,034
Everybody doesn't have
to hear this.

510
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,790
Let everybody hear it!
You didn't give me a son.

511
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,835
What can I expect
from a woman like you?

512
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,151
Professor...

513
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,355
Does that brat realize
I take nitroglycerin?

514
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,357
Calm down, Jindrich.

515
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,871
I was interrogated
by the Nazis!

516
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,515
You can't beat me
with something like gnocchi.

517
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,153
Take it away.
These gnocchi make me sick.

518
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:41,679
Who asked
for your opinion anyway?

519
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,318
Once you raise your own daughter
you can come talk to your father.

520
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,670
Did you see it, professor?

521
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,511
She takes French, English and
the piano, and she's a monster.

522
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,916
Let me quote
this respected publication:

523
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,350
Delicate Viennese gnocchi
can be prepared in steam...

524
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,998
I gave you life!

525
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,072
This is the result
of your choice of friends.

526
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,149
An anarchist bohemian and
a red Bolshevik gnocchi!

527
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,510
- What would you like?
- Dad wishes you happy holidays.

528
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,952
And asks if you could keep quiet
at least on Christmas Day.

529
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,593
Your dad...

530
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,953
Come say it yourself,
you communist pig!

531
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:57,077
You needn't to send a messenger!
This isn't the General's office!

532
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,631
Everybody knows something.

533
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,557
Do you know
who started the Beatles?

534
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,229
You think it was some Czech
patriots?

535
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,718
- Since when do you have X-mas?
- I'm gonna go nuts.

536
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:13,992
You're such a pig! You even get
wasted on Christmas Eve!

537
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,150
Fuck you! If you have
another heart attack,

538
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,431
I won't be there again to help
you, you son of a bitch!

539
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,191
No one ever asked you for that!

540
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,553
This is my house! My apartment!
I can yell as much as I want!

541
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,515
You got it for jerking off
on an army base,

542
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:42,352
but I got it for years
spent in a Nazi prison!

543
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,836
There's no soldier,
like a real soldier.

544
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,319
- I'm sorry. Good day, madam.
- Hello.

545
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,432
- Merry Christmas.
- To you as well. Go Pet'a.

546
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,751
- Hello.
- Hi.

547
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,317
- Can Jindra go out?
- Never... ever!

548
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,637
The guitar and I now stand
before your home

549
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:19,030
Take pity please at least
on this poor tree

550
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:25,795
That gave its life to sing
for you alone

551
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,956
And ask us in,
the guitar and me

552
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:40,474
The guitar and me

553
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,475
- SPRING 1968- It's time
- Pet'a! Help me. Quick.

554
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,072
- Big changes, huh?
- That's life.

555
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,349
It was about time.

556
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,470
This is good. At least we have
some true women in the audience.

557
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,310
It's better
to talk to the crowd.

558
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,674
You boys and girls don't need
to be shy to come to our station

559
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,677
to see our workplace.

560
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,679
Perhaps we're holding you
a bit, comrade police officer,

561
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,588
but as we have such a rare
chance, and some young men

562
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,872
may be considering the police
as their future occupation,

563
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,949
could you tell us some stories
from your professional life?

564
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,992
I'm sure you are full
of thrilling stories!

565
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:49,356
It's basically busywork -
mostly paperwork.

566
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,676
- Please...
- Please...

567
01:00:53,920 --> 01:01:00,917
We got the order to eliminate
a saboteur on a motorbike.

568
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,713
A man with a leather backpack.

569
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:11,076
Our position was at a blind turn.
We hid on a bluff by a pond.

570
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,597
It was about two thirty

571
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,316
when a man on a bike approached
us with a leather backpack.

572
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:30,119
He was an offender, of course.
A murderer most likely.

573
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,152
They must be treated
without kindness.

574
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,748
It's not like working
with a magnetic needle, kids.

575
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,670
As soon as the shooting stopped
we heard another motorbike.

576
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,554
A man with a leather backpack
was driving it.

577
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,231
The order was clear:
He can't get by at any cost!

578
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,031
There was no time
to contemplate who was who.

579
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,069
You mean...

580
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:10,678
That's right. Two rounds.
I gotta go. Duty calls.

581
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,392
That's pretty harsh, huh?

582
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:29,149
...when leading a society,
people must trust politicians.

583
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:36,476
If there is somebody saying
that today's party's politics

584
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:43,073
are just a matter of us,
that person knows very little...

585
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,192
- Talking about politics!
- About communist politics...

586
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,711
What do they want to reform?
It's always the same people!

587
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,556
The same bastards.

588
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,115
Thieves and murderers.

589
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,719
They want to turn the events of
1948 into a democratic movement.

590
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,156
- Look here!
- Show me.

591
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,671
- With jumping ropes! Come here.
- Good looking, huh?

592
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,716
This minister gets
almost no sleep

593
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,470
because she can get more work
done in the morning.

594
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,991
She is an emancipated woman,
nice and alert.

595
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,591
She likes doing it
because she's emancipated.

596
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,633
- She looks like a cleaning lady!
- Shut the door.

597
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,228
- Why?
- Someone might hear you.

598
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,918
And they'll lock you up again.

599
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,154
Proletariats of all countries,
fuck off!

600
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,872
Now I feel relieved, my dear.

601
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,391
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing.

602
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:15,390
No one believes that you are
okay. You just groaned.

603
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,071
- I didn't groan.
- Come on, you did.

604
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,033
Why would you groan
if you were okay?

605
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,080
I've been watching you for days.

606
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:35,035
You are getting pale like Death
vanishing before my eyes.

607
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,517
You can tell me everything!
Even that you don't feel good.

608
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,593
Now you groan! Try to deny it.

609
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,191
My daughter is rude...

610
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:02,113
and the old hypochondriac
is constantly groaning here!

611
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:11,109
Do I, the war invalid after
three heart attacks, groan?

612
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,835
Do I bother anybody here
with it? No, I don't!

613
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,633
Sorry. I know you are sick.
Me too.

614
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,911
I never got married because
I'm a variety artist.

615
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,429
It's a nomadic life.

616
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,352
It's an adventure...
tricks, charms, magic.

617
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,795
I'm on a special diet.

618
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:44,591
It's a lonesome life.
That's why I answered your ad.

619
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,392
I should probably show you
something. Naturally.

620
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:15,149
- How long have you been at this?
- From my youth. Sorry.

621
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,077
Basically since childhood.

622
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,116
Sorry,
let's finish that trick.

623
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,198
- Pavel, blow.
- My name is Pet'a.

624
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,955
- That's old.
- You'd be amazed. It still works.

625
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,359
I'm sorry.

626
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,236
- Check you out!
- Hello.

627
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,828
The youth are here doing
something for their health.

628
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,793
Show me
your smoker's papers, kids.

629
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:31,109
It's spring. The young people
are dating instead of studying.

630
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,909
Somebody may rely on his parents,
but hormones are working.

631
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,918
Everything in nature is pairing.

632
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,716
It looks like somebody is a
third wheel here. Right, Sebek?

633
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,109
No matter how I count:
one, two...

634
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,754
- You know what? Fuck you.
- Excuse me?

635
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,433
Fuck you!

636
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,836
A hippie in the family
of an army officer.

637
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,476
Now you're playing the hero,
but what will your dad say?

638
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,678
Hello? Hi dad. Fine...

639
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,633
He's got the best life.
His parents are in America.

640
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,718
- What about this?
- Show me.

641
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,913
That's grandpa.
Your grandfather.

642
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,954
- It's nice when dad isn't home!
- Don't say such stuff.

643
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,835
Can I join you in bed?

644
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,389
- You'll be hot.
- No, I won't.

645
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,239
Then come on in.

646
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,596
- Sour.
- What do you mean sour?

647
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:55,510
They can't be sour. They're
from professor Rhon from Bubenec.

648
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,991
They are pretty gross!

649
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,749
Was he like this
when you were still dating?

650
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,911
Who? Your father?

651
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,792
No, he wasn't.

652
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,068
Who are you going out
with anyway?

653
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,833
With the handsome guy?
Or with the neighbor?

654
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,871
Who would you go out with?

655
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:39,149
- It's an easy question.
- Well, I'm like you.

656
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,788
So you go out with Elien?

657
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,789
He is a bit like your father.

658
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,150
Then it's gonna be hell.
I won't be able to take it.

659
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,957
Do you think Elien and my father
have anything in common?

660
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,675
- How did you get that idea?
- I don't know. What do you think?

661
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,112
Actually they do.

662
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,031
- Don't be so pathetic.
- Don't ask me next time.

663
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,193
- Look. He's hanging out here.
- Michal.

664
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,233
Ssssh. Quiet. Don't startle him!

665
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,998
Don't be silly.

666
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,991
- I got you, you bastard!
- What's wrong?

667
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,317
Wait, you bastard! I'll show you.
I'm telling you to stand still!

668
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,908
- I will. Once you calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

669
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,793
- Dad, don't embarrass me here.
- Come on, Boza!

670
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,117
Okay, let's talk about it.
Man to man. Okay?

671
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,832
- Have you calmed down yet?
- Completely.

672
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,554
- Can we talk now?
- Okay, but stay where you are.

673
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,989
- I'm not moving, damn it.
- Mom, he's moving, right?

674
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,190
This isn't working.
We had a deal, right?

675
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,233
- You don't believe your own dad?
- No, I don't.

676
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,635
- Did you hear it?
- Good evening.

677
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,513
Hello. Jindriska.

678
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:43,838
What would your dad say
if you talked to him like this?

679
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,274
We sure achieved something.
You bastard!

680
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,351
Wait until you get home!

681
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,716
- Apologize to your teacher!
- He started it!

682
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,988
You idiot!

683
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,194
Thank you.

684
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,633
I haven't been to the movies
for fifteen years at least.

685
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,792
Jindra!

686
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,718
Come home.

687
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,719
Come home!

688
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:42,118
This chair is pretty low. I feel
like I'm sitting in an armchair.

689
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,557
But the food is delicious. It's
much better than canteen food.

690
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:55,708
I only eat in the canteen, and
their cooking isn't like yours.

691
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,594
You should know that
Pet'a is a pretty naughty kid.

692
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:07,798
I like kids and I do lectures.
That was why I answered your ad.

693
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,194
I see.

694
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,799
- Do you want to see my gun?
- No.

695
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,309
Guys always want to see a gun.

696
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,351
- Can I ask you something?
- No.

697
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,353
- What would you like to know?
- I wonder...

698
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,358
It doesn't burn, Pet'a.

699
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,474
I've heard that you killed
a man. Is it true?

700
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:42,152
It happened a long time ago.
I took a part in an operation.

701
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,953
- Against who?
- Against a spy.

702
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,517
There isn't much to tell.

703
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:55,798
We got an order to eliminate
a saboteur on a motorbike...

704
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,993
- Let's not write any more ads.
- Okay, we won't.

705
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,749
We can manage by ourselves.
I'll work.

706
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,638
Come on...

707
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,998
This is...

708
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:48,394
Jindriska, do you know where
I put my teeth last night?

709
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,636
In a glass in the bathroom.

710
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:07,068
As a girl a long time ago

711
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:16,151
The boys and
I climbed in trees

712
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,077
And when they broke
the branches

713
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:27,354
They put cherries
down my blouse

714
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,676
When they got too curious
what was under there

715
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:38,715
I shooed them away
with a green branch

716
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:49,711
I more or less
protected myself

717
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:58,670
Nobody could touch
my cherries

718
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,557
Don't ever trust
the boys you like

719
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,470
They'd all steal the cherries
from your pie

720
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,193
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

721
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,674
Before we get
to the children's grades

722
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,510
I'm obliged to inform you about
one very unpleasant thing.

723
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,872
There is a bad habit
spreading here.

724
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,596
The children use
cuss words too often.

725
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,837
Especially one of them.

726
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,038
That word is...

727
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,792
FUCK

728
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,715
- Where did they learn it?
- Not from us.

729
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,400
- Do they all say it?
- All of them.

730
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,875
Even Sebkova.

731
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,035
- That's terrible.
- Come in.

732
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,079
Hello. I'm sorry
to interrupt you...

733
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:22,228
I'm running around
but I can't find my way.

734
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,319
You know my wife used
to take care of the PTA.

735
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:32,675
Where is the high school glass...
I mean high school classrooms.

736
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,792
It's one floor up, Mr. Kraus.

737
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,638
I mean down.

738
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,031
You're on the wrong floor.

739
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,238
I'm sorry.

740
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,555
- Looking for somebody, comrade?
- What?

741
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,837
- Mr. Kraus!
- I'm sorry.

742
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,078
- Are you okay?
- It's fine. I just felt dizzy.

743
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,876
- You don't look good.
- You look terrible too.

744
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,028
I'm sorry. You're so pale.

745
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,628
I always look like this at
the end of the school year.

746
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,711
Did you find the class?

747
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,357
No, I didn't.

748
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:57,079
I've never even thought I'd be
so incompetent without a woman.

749
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,272
But Jindriska is almost
a grown woman.

750
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:08,478
- I've always wanted a son.
- I'll lend you mine sometimes.

751
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,115
Thank you. I'm home.

752
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,232
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

753
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,195
- What is the medal for?
- For bravery.

754
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,313
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

755
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,555
Hello? Dad?

756
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,391
Fine. You want me to come
to see you in Washington? When?

757
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:03,232
Life is only luck

758
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,638
Today you're up,
tomorrow down

759
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:15,917
And then life flows on
to the sea of death to drown

760
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,918
All drift along to the sea

761
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:25,272
Some today and some tomorrow

762
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:33,193
And if you find love
don't waste it on sorrow

763
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,636
What are you running for?
You'll wear me out.

764
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,074
I can't go there panting like
this. Let's go see your aunt.

765
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,430
- No way.
- Go ahead.

766
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,869
Aunt Eva is coming, but
she's not coming to see us.

767
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,593
Do you think
she takes him seriously?

768
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,837
I think it's a done deal.

769
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,356
You seem
as if it was today's headline.

770
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,393
- You can't do anything about it.
- Why would I change anything?

771
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,957
She's gonna ruin her life
with that choleric.

772
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:26,389
I know she's a teacher but
she is completely unteachable!

773
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,315
Do you want me to put tomato
sauce there for tomorrow?

774
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,356
Go open the door, please.

775
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,113
- Hello.
- Hello, professor. Hi scout.

776
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,831
- Come in. Take your thing off.
- Aren't we here too early?

777
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:59,475
- Not at all.
- Pet'a couldn't wait.

778
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,192
Look what I brought you.

779
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:08,388
This is beautiful!

780
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,870
- Hi Jindriska!
- Hello.

781
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,149
What are you making?

782
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,636
- Gnocchi?
- I tried making dumplings.

783
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,478
- They're overcooked.
- Yeah.

784
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,592
Let me help you. It happens.

785
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:29,868
This has Burian's pictures in it.
You can meet Zdenek Burian.

786
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,831
He's my friend.

787
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,793
- Pet'a's so wrapped up with him.
- Me too.

788
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:41,559
- I've always wanted a daughter.
- Dad has always wanted a son.

789
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,238
- Can I taste it?
- Sure.

790
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,759
It looks good.

791
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,996
It's delicious!
Did you make it by yourself?

792
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,917
It's my mom's recipe.

793
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,709
Why is she there for so long?

794
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,351
Eva isn't eighteen.

795
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,149
She may know what she's doing.
I'm happy she'll live here.

796
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:12,032
He alone is enough for me!

797
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,433
- This is not right, is it?
- It's good.

798
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,838
- You meant the sauce?
- It's delicious!

799
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:32,190
I eat everything.
Jail taught me a lesson.

800
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:39,234
You have no idea...
but this is delicious!

801
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:43,956
It's great, isn't it Pet'a?
Say something.

802
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,358
The dumplings remind me
of the eggs of Chelonia Mydas.

803
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,313
- Whose eggs?
- Sea turtle's.

804
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,440
- Dad?
- Yeah.

805
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,357
Can I go to the movies?

806
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,311
You are staying at home so you
don't get into any trouble.

807
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,237
I have summer vacation.

808
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,515
You have nothing to do?

809
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,869
I have a date with Jindra.

810
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,437
Then go ahead,
go out with your cousin.

811
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:41,949
This is professor Masaryk,
our president and liberator.

812
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,753
Soon you'll be studying
about him again.

813
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:52,871
I'm an optimist.
The West is supporting us.

814
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,676
At least this is what
my brother says. He's in London.

815
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:04,399
We give the Bolsheviks
one year. Two at the most.

816
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,598
Excuse me!

817
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,038
- Hello!
- Hello!

818
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:17,711
- Is Jindra home?
- No. She's with her boyfriend.

819
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,993
I see. Thank you.

820
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,553
Bye.

821
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,950
You're looking forward to it,
aren't you?

822
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,678
- It's just for a year.
- What do you mean?

823
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,953
Come on.

824
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,199
Jindra!

825
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,071
- Hi.
- Hi.

826
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,395
- Is Jindra with you?
- No.

827
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,114
- Then say hello to her.
- She's not here.

828
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,835
- Promise me you'll come back.
- I won't be gone forever.

829
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,439
It was beautiful.

830
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,035
- Hi!
- Hi.

831
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,912
I was looking for you.

832
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,191
Elien's going to see his parents
so I wanted to say good bye.

833
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,313
- Really?
- Bye. Good night.

834
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,668
G'night.

835
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,311
- How long are you going for?
- I don't know yet.

836
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,195
Bye.

837
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:41,038
Come on. Elien will be back
in a year, right?

838
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:47,710
Meanwhile you and I could
go out. Just the two of us.

839
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,590
- We could.
- You think so too?

840
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:55,633
- We are almost family.
- That's right.

841
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,791
I can go with you anywhere,
Michal

842
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:04,469
since we are practically
brother and sister.

843
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:10,436
Because it's obvious that there
are things among siblings which

844
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,790
are totally out of the question.

845
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:55,070
- Are you gonna have more kids?
- Come on, Vasek.

846
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,957
Kids, come get some finger food!

847
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,031
- Be careful, Pet'a.
- Sure.

848
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,479
Offer some to everybody.

849
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,756
- Marus?
- Yeah...

850
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,636
London came through.

851
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,437
Eva, that's great.
I have goose bumps!

852
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,188
- That's what I call a honeymoon.
- Isn't that great?

853
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,914
Gentlemen, I read an article
in "Foreigner Curiosities"

854
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:42,116
that an average woman thinks
about sex every five minutes.

855
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,630
An average human,
I mean a man

856
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,558
thinks about it
every seven minutes.

857
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:55,433
- What's the point of the story?
- That I'm an average woman.

858
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,315
In that case I'm a woman too.

859
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:05,037
Gentlemen, I had a patient who
was not yet as old as Jindrich

860
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,196
and he didn't have
a heart condition.

861
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:12,394
Even the age difference
wasn't as big as yours.

862
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:16,399
Guess what? That man expired
during their wedding night.

863
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,310
Professor, stop painting
the devil on the wall.

864
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,437
That's reality.

865
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,273
I'd like to show you
the results of my yearly work.

866
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,791
Actually it was
more my brother's idea.

867
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,913
As you know he lives in London,
and we still write each other.

868
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:45,752
My brother, captain Otakar Kraus,
flew for Royal British Airforce.

869
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,396
During the war he shot down
five enemy fighter planes.

870
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:55,878
While the biggest tyrants
and mass murderers

871
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,710
have giant monuments here,

872
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,268
Czech pilots don't have even
a tiny memorial in Prague,

873
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:10,918
but it seems that after a long
period of rule by crude vermin,

874
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,192
even those in the highest places
are coming to their senses.

875
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,676
Hopefully an advantageous time
for our plan is arriving.

876
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:26,716
My brother and I decided to use
the lonesome pedestal on Letna,

877
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,798
which is standing there
for absolutely no reason.

878
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,232
To make a long story short,
following my brothers directions

879
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:38,751
I built
something like a small model.

880
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,199
Back then.

881
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,793
And now.

882
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:58,756
Don't pay any attention to this.
As you know I wanted a son but...

883
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:04,070
This is supposed
to be my brother.

884
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:09,638
This is pilot Fajtl. We haven't
made up our minds yet...

885
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:17,316
Well, compare the difference.

886
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,916
Just to take off, huh?

887
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,076
It must have been
a hell of a lot of work,

888
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,474
and it's such a silly thing,
right?

889
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:12,115
Don't just sit here like a lump.
Go have fun with the others.

890
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:17,040
You can't be tucked in here
like this.

891
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,068
Fresh coffee is coming.

892
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,108
- Did you give them the spoons?
- Not yet.

893
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,315
- What spoons?
- Our wedding present.

894
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,712
- Come on, bro!
- It's not the right time now.

895
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,035
Why not? This is the right time.

896
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,674
Why wouldn't this be
the right time for our present?

897
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,236
- Which one is it?
- That one over there but...

898
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,072
Let them open it themselves.

899
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,036
Well, Eva, open it!

900
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:18,112
- What is it?
- Teaspoons.

901
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:24,357
A lot of teaspoons
are always useful.

902
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:30,915
Watch out! They are not
just any old teaspoons.

903
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:41,275
They are plastic teaspoons.
Light, flexible and pliable.

904
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,830
Here you go, professor.

905
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:50,149
You see, these teaspoons were
developed in socialist Germany.

906
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:29,351
I told you to save them.
They weren't made for hot coffee.

907
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:47,316
I wonder where our German
comrades made their mistake.

908
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,474
There were shooting
in the air during the war.

909
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,431
You two were made
for each other, right?

910
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,992
Anything not from the USA
isn't good enough for you.

911
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:12,834
If I put two identical
matchboxes in front of you...

912
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,034
and I said one was American,
which one would be better, huh?

913
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,628
The American one, of course.

914
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,230
- Of course, the American one.
- Of course, the American one.

915
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:30,552
You're like my son. He brags
about America, about jeans...

916
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:35,834
Why doesn't he get his hair cut
like an American astronaut?

917
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,871
Where's that bastard anyway?

918
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:04,556
Nirvana, Olympia
And Heaven don't exist

919
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:11,429
If someone rags on the world
I just get pissed

920
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:18,230
I don't care about
The infinite universe

921
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:24,435
I'm fine with
A few great years on Earth

922
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:34,959
Heaven on earth exists you see
I speak the truth, believe me

923
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:42,478
For life I'd give mine if I must
but I don't wanna bite the dust

924
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:47,720
I'm not alone, believe me

925
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:53,437
There are beautiful things
for those who want to live

926
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:58,999
Heaven's beauty depends on you

927
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:04,638
When the time comes
You'll know what to do

928
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,638
When heaven on earth
Starts for you and me...

929
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,718
- Are you looking for something?
- Where are the tablecloths?

930
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:35,150
Go get Michal to put you
in bed at home, okay?

931
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:55,672
- Mom! My brother's dead!
- What are you talking about?

932
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:02,353
- He has his head in the oven.
- In our electrical oven?

933
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,678
Michal!

934
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,760
Calm down. Let me see.

935
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:24,195
It won't be bad, but I'll take
him to the hospital to make sure.

936
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,270
Jindriska!

937
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,519
- Dad!
- Bohous!

938
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,600
What did the doctor say?

939
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,279
It's just as well.

940
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:58,079
I'm fine. I just collapsed.
It's not a big deal...

941
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,796
Let's go home.

942
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,750
How is he?

943
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,788
- Well?
- He has heatstroke.

944
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:22,839
It's so stupid to try poisoning
yourself in an electrical oven.

945
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,359
Sorry.

946
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:30,272
To tell the true,
he started to smell good.

947
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,113
Eva...

948
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,679
Vasek...

949
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,038
Bro...

950
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,232
Attention...

951
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:11,149
Marshall Malinovsky.

952
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,832
I read you.

953
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,393
What?

954
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,831
Let me give you my grandmother.

955
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,118
What's wrong?

956
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:00,755
- I can hear it.
- Who is it?

957
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,077
- It just woke me up.
- Is anything wrong with Michal?

958
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:15,155
Dad! The Russians are here!

959
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,032
- What?
- What?

960
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:22,876
Tell them we'll be right there.
Tell them to wait for us.

961
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,391
- What?
- Boris? That dumb ass.

962
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,672
Turn on the radio!

963
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:06,348
You studied Russian. How do you
say bastards in Russian?

964
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,238
Duraki.

965
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:18,718
Yesterday,
on August 20th, 1968

966
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:26,474
the armies of the Soviet Union,
Poland. Germany, Hungary

967
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:32,675
and Bulgaria crossed
the Czechoslovak borders.

968
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,073
When I came back
everything was different.

969
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,039
Brother!

970
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,673
Are you nuts?

971
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,797
What?

972
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,709
Dad's whole world fell apart.
He took it as total betrayal.

973
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:22,273
But some got promoted.

974
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,597
Comrade principal!
I'm looking for classroom 4B.

975
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,830
It wasn't just Elien
who didn't return.

976
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:36,474
Mom has never seen
Aunt Eva again.

977
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,872
The honeymoon
was extended for twenty years.

978
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,918
This film is dedicated
to everyone

979
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:26,910
whose friends, lovers,
parents and children

980
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:33,752
disappeared overnight
as you remainded here alone.
