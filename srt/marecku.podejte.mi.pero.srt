1
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,965
Hi, what's for lunch?

2
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:40,136
Is this everything you have for us?

3
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:42,596
I may ask what's for lunch, no?

4
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:46,545
Yes. But may we ask you
how about your grades?

5
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,148
Oh, grades...

6
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:52,870
It may turn out that you won't be

7
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,569
getting lunch, you know?

8
00:00:58,218 --> 00:01:02,324
History... Mmm

9
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:05,535
Czech... You don't speak Czech?

10
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,429
Well...

11
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,101
Uuuugh...

12
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:16,350
Chemistry! Also nice.
So, Mum...

13
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,523
But I have an Excellent
in Math!

14
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,988
Give him some soup.
He doesn't deserve more!

15
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:29,898
Come here, Hujer!
You'll have to explain this -

16
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:33,201
Here, on Monday:
checked in at 6:00 and then

17
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,443
checked out at 6:02
and again in 6:03

18
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,146
What does it mean? That you wander
at the gate in and out?

19
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,636
I read the daily press.

20
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:50,122
I admire it. But we go to work
right on the first attempt! Take it...

21
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:19,066
Mr. Supervisor!

22
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:21,738
The sausages are on the table.

23
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,708
Thank you, Suzy, thank you.

24
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:24,758
Don't mention it.

25
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:46,540
So, the new building will be up to here?

26
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,843
A great deal of change is waiting for us.

27
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:52,158
They say we won't recognize
it when we see it.

28
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:20,134
No fear, George, you'll grasp it.

29
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:24,583
Oh yeah, no fear. They are building something decent, aren't they?

30
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:29,327
I was talking about that schooling.
Not to be afraid about it.

31
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,871
We are not afraid of it, no.

32
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:34,883
A lot of people are interested -

33
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,680
here - Hloušek, Krabatý...

34
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,237
Hloušek, Krabatý!

35
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,387
What is it?

36
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,937
Come here.

37
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,082
Moment

38
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:44,791
Even Famfula.

39
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:47,632
Famfula!
Famfula!

40
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,311
Come here!

41
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:58,568
Tell the comrade deputy Director
what you've decided about schooling.

42
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,042
Well, yeah, I would go for it.

43
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,242
It's not about Famfula

44
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:05,342
Although we are glad that you
want to take that

45
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,084
welding course.

46
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,622
It's more about your high school, George

47
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:10,922
About mine?

48
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:14,672
Yes. In order to be a supervisor
in the new factory, you know.

49
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:18,272
Wait, I was thinking the young would take over.

50
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,772
You wouldn't send us, the old people
with the bad knees

51
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:21,872
to school?

52
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,474
Look here. Given the automatic production

53
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,961
everything will change.

54
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,174
So, for example, here

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,817
Here an automatic transporter
will lead to the new building

56
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,074
There will be an enormous KL-2

57
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:41,774
And above everything,
There will be a glass observation tower.

58
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,611
It will be so beautiful!

59
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,558
Later, in the office, I will
show you the plans, you know.

60
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,326
And in that observation desk
a supervisor will sit

61
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:51,832
with a high school diploma.

62
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,491
He will possess a ruler...
a logarithmic one, of course.

63
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:58,130
And he will be automatically
above all...

64
00:06:58,421 --> 00:06:59,813
...even salary wise.

65
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,444
Well, I think it's not so desperate at all.
What would you say to that, George?

66
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,180
Well, as I have told you before

67
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,570
let anybody sit in that square tower, but

68
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,220
you won't get me in that school.

69
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,481
Hujer is raising a hand.

70
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,703
If you'd allow, comrade deputy Director,
in the case that I would

71
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:23,677
graduate that high school,
may I, as a quality control inspector, rely

72
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:28,000
and I am not pushing myself into
comrade Kroupa's place,

73
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:30,137
could I hope for a glassed space?

74
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,565
Naturally.

75
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,398
It depends how comrade Kroupa will decide.

76
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:36,891
Oh, excellent!

77
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,709
And because comrade Kroupa
already has decided,

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,400
we could disband all this and everybody
could mind his own business.

79
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,208
Neruda.

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
That one.

81
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,241
In the cage with a lion spirit.

82
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:52,478
So, what kind of a problem is this?
To learn a pair of verses?

83
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,546
I did know it by heart,
but it fell out.

84
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:57,076
Fell out!
I went to school 30 years ago

85
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,647
and nothing has fallen out.

86
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,460
I remember some of the poems even today.

87
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:03,487
For example:
„The mother has died

88
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:08,264
and they burried her.“
See? And wake me up in midnight

89
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,562
„She left orphans behind...

90
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,864
Well, OK.
Now may I go swimming?

91
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,435
„They came every morning

92
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:19,209
and looked for their mother“
But you think about love notes

93
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:20,309
and not about school.

94
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:24,340
„And the mother felt sorry for the poor children...“

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,019
Ha-ha.  It's still there!

96
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,188
Somebody is ringing!

97
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:42,569
„...and her soul returned.“

98
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:47,584
Good evening!
Hi!

99
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:48,734
What has happened?

100
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:52,558
We would like to discuss with you
that issue,

101
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:53,898
that, well...

102
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:59,131
Enter, please. Enter.

103
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,324
That way, come on.

104
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,339
Now, George, we have contemplated
a long time about it.

105
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,518
We won't force you into anything.

106
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:10,618
I wouldn't even advice you to try me.

107
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:15,159
But try to imagine it. When Hujer
graduates from that school

108
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:20,000
and you won't, it would be a disaster,
because he will fight for the supervisor job.

109
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,169
And you saw him how
crazy about it he was.

110
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:27,500
And I would have to, only because of Hujer,
at this age, learn formulas and write homeworks?

111
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,250
Mr. Kroupa, that you won't manage it?
Just don't say that.

112
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
Look, the people at the workshop love you.

113
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,124
You are strict.
You won't turn a blind eye to anyone.

114
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:40,024
You are also competent and just.
When I just imagine Hujer...

115
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:42,924
It's true, George, you won't do this to us.

116
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,508
Daddy, don't hesitate. You have good memory.

117
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:49,108
„The orphans behind her..“
You remember it more than 30 years.

118
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:52,858
Come on, go swimming!
You, advisor... as if I needed your advice.

119
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:54,608
The „best“ in class.

120
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,143
You see it George,
he's all after you.

121
00:09:58,911 --> 00:10:00,361
OK, wait a sec.

122
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:03,647
Wait.

123
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,808
May I?

124
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,895
Look at this.

125
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:22,431
Even if you cut me in such tiny noodles

126
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,181
you won't get me into any school!

127
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,151
<i>We welcome the students
of the Technical High School</i>

128
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:30,101
We welcome you and
wish you a lot of success in school.

129
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:32,051
Here you have the school program.

130
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,796
We welcome you and
wish you a lot of success.

131
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Here you have the school program.

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,601
We welcome you and lots of success.

133
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,851
We welcome you and wish you
a lot of success.

134
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:47,801
Here you have.. Hi, Dad! Here
you have the school program.

135
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:52,051
Your clasroom is up and right
If you can't find it - it's the same as mine.

136
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,103
Is it free here?

137
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,285
Yes

138
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,401
<i>Kroupa is an ox.</i>

139
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,411
Šlajs!

140
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:33,901
Tuček!

141
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:37,152
I won't ever get rid of him!
Sorry, we have been sitting

142
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:40,785
together since 1st grade and he's keeping
that place on the first desk for me.

143
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:41,952
Hi!

144
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:43,452
Hi! Man, where did you get this?

145
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,202
And where have you lost this?

146
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,002
You know, my wife.

147
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:51,616
Here, in the school rules it is written
that the student should go to school

148
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,283
properly kept.

149
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:57,702
Does it mean that we have to
shave every day?

150
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,919
Good evening.

151
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:10,946
Evening!

152
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:12,952
Sit down.

153
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:22,202
Thank you.

154
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,152
Thank you.

155
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,091
Whose is this, please?

156
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:45,204
I took the liberty, for the occasion

157
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:48,814
from my little garden... some plums,
if you don't find it insulting...

158
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,359
Well, really, from you,

159
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,318
maybe we can taste them in class,
everyone together.

160
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,216
No, no, please!
They are only for you!

161
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,985
OK, thank you.

162
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,923
My name is Čeněk Janda.
I am your class teacher.

163
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,704
This is good!

164
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,808
Pardon?

165
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,301
Nothing, we are just glad.

166
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,187
Yes. I will teach you mathematics and...

167
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,133
Dear students of the evening technical school!

168
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,270
Excuse me.

169
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:24,140
Allow me to.. [distortion]

170
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,232
This equipment has some years behind it.

171
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:34,740
Comrade Director wanted to say, basically,
that he welcomes you, that

172
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:38,111
we have actually talked about it
at the council

173
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:43,244
that having to go to work every day
and from work to school,

174
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,546
this isn't really a joke.

175
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,675
But we, on our side
will do anything for you to succeed.

176
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:56,810
I will teach you mathematics and
descriptive geometry.

177
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:01,700
And now, I would gladly
get to know you.

178
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,420
Březina?

179
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:06,281
You work as a..?

180
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,751
Locksmith.

181
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:08,851
Thank you.

182
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,895
Dudek.

183
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:12,773
Accountant.

184
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:14,749
Gregorová.

185
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,351
Turner.

186
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,962
Fulinová.

187
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,690
Toolmaker.

188
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:23,621
Yes. Thank you.

189
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:27,198
Aluminum?

190
00:14:27,878 --> 00:14:29,336
Is Aluminum present?

191
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,893
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

192
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,613
OK. We'll put that down.

193
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:35,941
Hujer?

194
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,041
Here.

195
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,141
Viktor.

196
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:39,241
Quality Control

197
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,235
for the moment.

198
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,145
Ah, we talked.

199
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,250
Kroupa?

200
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,160
Supervisor.

201
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,427
I am here conditionally -

202
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:50,787
Pardon?

203
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,733
That I am here conditionaly,
it's decided this way.

204
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,502
If I have any difficulties
with the learning

205
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:58,623
I quit on the spot.

206
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:01,844
Yes?

207
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:04,969
You are entitled to it.

208
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,410
Mužik?

209
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,210
Rakouna!

210
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:09,615
Supervisor.

211
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,186
Thanks.

212
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:13,549
Pavlíček?

213
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,299
<i>Kroupa jr. is an ox.</i>

214
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,577
Planning.

215
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:17,953
Thank you.

216
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:19,572
Plha?

217
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:21,822
Warehouseman.

218
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,458
Roubiček.

219
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:25,109
I have a question.

220
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:26,436
Here...

221
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,448
in the school handbook
it's written that

222
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:32,313
„Always, the student must
go to school

223
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,499
properly kept.“

224
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:36,620
Does it mean that

225
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:38,724
we have to shave every day?

226
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:40,036
Don't disturb.

227
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,136
But, no!

228
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,601
When I shave daily, I bleed.

229
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:51,271
So, you don't have to take thesе
rules litelally.

230
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,554
It's about small children.

231
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,970
But children don't shave.

232
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:58,621
It's true.

233
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:02,458
But they have to be washed
and combed and such...

234
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:03,558
Roubiček.

235
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,234
And I have another question.

236
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,305
Here, in article 8, it says -
„The parents are being informed of

237
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:16,042
the student's grades

238
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:19,053
at regular meetings.“

239
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,453
Yes, it's also about kids.

240
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:27,164
Well, it's because my parents
live in Kojčice.

241
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,689
This is far away, near Pelhřimov,

242
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:32,604
and my parents are old, and...

243
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,704
But..

244
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:36,829
...it's a lot of travelling...

245
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,015
...as I said, Mr. Plha,

246
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,216
Don't torture your head with this,

247
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,985
it concerns little children.

248
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,312
Roubiček.

249
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,412
That's why,

250
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:49,020
because I don't know otherwise.

251
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,513
The train is not for free, also.

252
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,472
Please, sit down at last.

253
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,722
But no, don't you understand?

254
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,438
I don't know about you, but

255
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:02,214
these 70 korunas for my parents, to travel...

256
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,494


257
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:04,594
Roubiček

258
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:05,694
Supervisor.

259
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,217
Supervisor at the mill.

260
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,317
Thank you.

261
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:11,248
Šlajs?

262
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,600
Clerk.

263
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,348
Thank you.

264
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,534
Tuček.

265
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,775
Well?

266
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,188
And you work like a...?

267
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:29,769
Like a horse, Mr. Teacher.

268
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,234
Is the place free?

269
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:35,334
Certainly.

270
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,284
What's up George?

271
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:43,384
What?

272
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:44,484
What?

273
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,584
What what?

274
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:47,092
Come on, tell me!

275
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,192
What should I tell you?

276
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:51,431
What about school?
How is it going?

277
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:52,531
School?

278
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,138
Haven't you seen a school yet?

279
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:56,304
This is it..

280
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,186
It is interesting, they have all those things -

281
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:02,068
desks, a blackboard, a sponge.

282
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,108
And there are some models, that you can see

283
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,844
the structure of animals, stones...

284
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,398
What do you want to know more? What?

285
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,324
You know what I want to know, don't you?

286
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,424
I know.

287
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:13,255
Here, I would go there,

288
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:15,910
But I am there on a condition.
We clearly agreed on it -

289
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,010
And poor you,

290
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,110
poor you!

291
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:19,909
If it doesn't click.

292
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:21,009
Poor you!

293
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,671
Sit down, students!

294
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,756
Mareček, please hand me the pen.

295
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,244
I am Tuček, Mr. Professor.

296
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:50,344
Yes.

297
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:55,817
Aluminum is still absent.

298
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,553
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

299
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,707
It does not concern me
where he is.

300
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,378
Let him work it out with your class teacher.

301
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:06,600
I am marking him „absent“.

302
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,994
Thank you, Mareček.

303
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:23,939
I am professor Hrbolek.

304
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,513
I will teach you Czech.

305
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,747
And, if anybody is interested,

306
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,694
I can teach you private lessons in Latin.

307
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:35,207
And if somebody finds it difficult

308
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:38,250
to keep up with me in the Czech language course,

309
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,084
I offer private tuition as well.

310
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,735
Well, is anybody

311
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,467
interested?

312
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,187
I am retired, I have plenty of time.

313
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,292
Well, I am just substituting for

314
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,720
a colleague - Ptáček.

315
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,614
I have a question -

316
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,528
May I put Latin to use in my field?

317
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,309
And in what field do you plan to

318
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,236
dedicate yourself, student?

319
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,049
I keep the warehouse

320
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,506
in the screw mill.

321
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:06,501
Even a warehouse keeper could read

322
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,577
the original texts of Vergil.

323
00:20:10,047 --> 00:20:12,038
So, I write you down.

324
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,138
But,

325
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:15,616
What is your name?

326
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,716
Plha.

327
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,218
I have not yet decided, for sure...

328
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:22,885
You will come

329
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,479
every Wednesday at 14:00, Mlha.

330
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,138
And now, we'll write a

331
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,781
little evaluative dictation.

332
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,245
So, prepare sheets of paper,

333
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:40,548
prepare your penholders, pens,

334
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:42,426
ink pots.

335
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,198
And we'll start dictating.

336
00:20:54,455 --> 00:21:05,998
„Fierce jackals howled grimly at the white moon“

337
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,657
Look here, only one mistake!

338
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:13,332
I thought that word „howled“ somehow
was connected to „owls“.

339
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,432


340
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:17,736
„Fierce jackals owled grimly“

341
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,076
Otherwise, as you see

342
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:20,715
without a single little mistake.

343
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,123
It could have been an Excellent.

344
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,066
Only this tiny mistake,
as you can see.

345
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,272
Only this tiny mistake.

346
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:29,392
On the other hand, Hujer,

347
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,513
what is this blob, at your age?

348
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,472
This is a shame!

349
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,750
For a little reality check,

350
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,040
I'll tell you something.

351
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:45,599
What do you think did I get on the
evaluative dictation?

352
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,102
Good?

353
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:49,994
Very good?

354
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:51,094
Not even close.

355
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,431
I am familiar with it.

356
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:56,089
May I reveal?

357
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,111
A total failure.

358
00:21:58,474 --> 00:21:59,780
That's it, sirs.

359
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,102
These were some crooked words,
weren't they?

360
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:03,202
Please.

361
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,388
An ordinary dictation from my

362
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:06,488
mother tongue - Czech and

363
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:07,588
flunked.

364
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:10,820
You see that I have come a long way

365
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,219
that I have patience,

366
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,137
but if it goes on the same way

367
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,075
we'll have a serious conversation.

368
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,284
Tell me

369
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:24,006
what are the disadvantages of the
steam engine?

370
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,588
A disadvantage of the steam engine is its

371
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:30,889
great weight.

372
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:31,989
We'll say „mass“.

373
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,342
Its great weight..mass, and

374
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,529
low efficiency.

375
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:43,214
How low is this efficiency?

376
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,162
Look, I don't like this,

377
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,401
I'll answer or I'll tell that
I don't know.

378
00:22:58,501 --> 00:22:59,501
Don't be silent like a

379
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:00,601
ghost.

380
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:01,701
What is your name?

381
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,501
Ghost.

382
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:06,611
With such a name, you have
some right, but

383
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:08,332
please, learn it.

384
00:23:08,612 --> 00:23:09,928
between 5%  and 10 %.

385
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,369
Let's summarize -

386
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:14,095
The historical significance of
the steam engine.

387
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,195
Svátek.

388
00:23:18,252 --> 00:23:19,683
The... the steam engine

389
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:23,238
was invented in the 18th century...

390
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:24,338
Yes, please.

391
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,499
The steam engine

392
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,583
invented in the 18th century

393
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:30,683
Continue.

394
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,941
Šlajs is raising a hand, please.

395
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,279
Please,

396
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,383
he's ashamed to tell you.

397
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:37,483
Can you disclose

398
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,486
what is so delicate about
the steam engine?

399
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,530
He's ashamed to say that
he must walk.

400
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:43,867
Walk?

401
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:44,967
And where?

402
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,500
Nowhere. Just walking.

403
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,983
Svátek is accustomed to walking
while thinking.

404
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:51,912
If he doesn't walk he
won't be able to think.

405
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:53,404
Look, Tuček.

406
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,115
I already know about
your bright ideas.

407
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,561
But he can do it, please.

408
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,044
I work in sales

409
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:00,578
and when I dictate letters

410
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:01,678
I must walk.

411
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,154
OK, then. Get out on the aisle

412
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,725
and walk, if it would help you.

413
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:08,352
The steam engine

414
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,923
was invented in the 18th century

415
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,225
and was developed fundamentally

416
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,831
in the 19th century.

417
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,936
That is why

418
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,111
we call the 19th century

419
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:19,237
„The steam century“

420
00:24:26,193 --> 00:24:27,354
Jarda!

421
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,868
Jarda!

422
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,703
Jarda!

423
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:35,377
The phone is ringing.

424
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,036
The phone is ringing.

425
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:38,612
Thanks!

426
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,567
Hello, here is the gate.

427
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:47,247
Here is the rail station.

428
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:48,347
Gate,

429
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,491
The monkey house has arrived.

430
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,580
Is it that thing behind you?

431
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,131
Has it arrived already?

432
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,815
Yeah. You have it on the third track.

433
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:08,736
How wide is it?

434
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,981
How... how wide is it, they ask?

435
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,510
About... 3 meters (10 ft.)

436
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:19,589
Most important, I don't want it
to stink here for too long.

437
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:22,989
Everybody, come and see!

438
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,089
It has been delivered!

439
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,500
It will be warm inside.

440
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:11,915
It has a lot of control units.

441
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,015
What is this?

442
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:16,079
This is the cockpit of the supervisor

443
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:18,971
and an executive armchair.

444
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:23,482
Hujer, the forwarders are waiting for
the stacks!

445
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,581
I am on my way already!

446
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,875
Running!

447
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,988
You must also have a look
they have installed an armchair.

448
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:36,981
Hujer, today you also
wandered about the gate!

449
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:38,935
I know, I know, but

450
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:40,688
the paper!

451
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:07,509
Stop, Franta! Stop!

452
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:13,650
Famfula!

453
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:16,207
Famfula!

454
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,307
How does it run?

455
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,400
It runs wonderfully, but

456
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:21,733
it doesn't sow.

457
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:30,018
It's quite a substantial problem
for a drill, no?

458
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,666
Did you look under?

459
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:32,766
No

460
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,864
You had to bend a little, eh?

461
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:39,453
There is stuck paint under.

462
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:43,394
Mareček, hand me the pen.

463
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,122
I am Tuček, Mr. Professor.

464
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,087
Yes. Yes.

465
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:54,961
And as I see it, Aluminum is still absent.

466
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:57,451
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

467
00:28:57,853 --> 00:28:59,271
Yes. Yes,

468
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,515
but he is absent.

469
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:05,624
Thank you, Mareček.

470
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:11,531
So what did we

471
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:12,631
study

472
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,947
last time?

473
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:17,415
Mlha?

474
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:20,641
Last time we studied

475
00:29:20,741 --> 00:29:22,774
one of the great poets

476
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:23,874
of „the steam century“

477
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:26,112
Jan Neruda.

478
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:28,770
The steam century?

479
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:30,478
Yes

480
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,649
19th century is called

481
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,179
„The steam century“.

482
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,222
We studied it in physics.

483
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:39,042
Well, all right.

484
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:40,404
All right.

485
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:44,234
But don't say it in my classes.

486
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,398
We shall keep to the standard name -

487
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,435
The 19th century.

488
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:57,275
And what did we have for homework, eh?

489
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,471
So?

490
00:30:06,397 --> 00:30:10,126
That I didn't give you any homework?!

491
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:12,158
No, Mr. Professor,

492
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:15,117
you said that, above all, we had to
get a good rest.

493
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:18,053
It doesn't sound like me.

494
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:20,119
Please.

495
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,446
We had to learn a poem by heart.

496
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,914
„Like lions beating against bars“

497
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,014
Yes.

498
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:30,637
Thank you that you reminded me.

499
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:33,930
Kroupa.

500
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,560
Come on, Kroupa.

501
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Come here.

502
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,848
You had problems with the
dictation

503
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,684
You may compensate with
reciting.

504
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,705
And no mumbling,

505
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:47,753
let those verses flow.

506
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:50,232
Jan Neruda,

507
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,186
from Cosmic Songs.

508
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,216
„ Like lions beating against bars,

509
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:59,811
like lions, captured in a cage,

510
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,088
we yarn to fly up to the heavens,

511
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:05,997
yet we are...“

512
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:08,755
„earthbound“

513
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,333
„earthbound“

514
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:23,527
„We seem to hear a voice from stars:“,
please!

515
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:27,401
„We seem to hear a voice from stars:“

516
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:30,505
“Come, you men, closer,

517
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,939
Just a bit closer..“

518
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,039
„a bit closer“, eer

519
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,739
„Just a bit closer, you hubristic beings,“

520
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,190
please

521
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,948
„Whose feet are stone-bound!”

522
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:45,835
„We come!“

523
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:48,023
„Forgive us, dear Mother.“

524
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,982
„The Earth is too confined for us.“

525
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:52,082
„Shine - “

526
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,470
„we'll add it to the thought“

527
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,418
„and our legs“

528
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,897
„will march, steam powered“

529
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,639
The steam century!

530
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,090
I said it...

531
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,352
Don't disturb!

532
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,384
We'll come!

533
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,226
We'll come!

534
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,135
We

535
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,056
shall come.

536
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,120
We hear, we hear you coming,

537
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:19,219
but what next?

538
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,285
I don't know it after that.

539
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:24,243
What would I do with you, boy?

540
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:27,191
You didn't make me happy and

541
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:30,395
I won't make you happy too.

542
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:33,097
Sit down.

543
00:32:33,678 --> 00:32:37,541
For the next time, you'll have to make
an analysis of this poem.

544
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:41,014
And now, a prosaic work of
Neruda.

545
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:42,114
Please.

546
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,341
What do you want?

547
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,753
Please, Mr. Professor,

548
00:32:46,853 --> 00:32:48,003
let's sing.

549
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:49,103
Let's sing!
Please!

550
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:50,203
What!?

551
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:52,302
We don't have a music class

552
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:53,402
and in other classes,
like chemistry

553
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,662
It does not fit in.

554
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,644
But we'll be delayed too much.
I wanted to...

555
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,368
I wanted to bridge the gaps!

556
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:02,931
It is raining!

557
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,031
What?

558
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,839
Let's sing „It is Raining“!

559
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,787
All right, but quickly, please.

560
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,091
It is raining, let it pour.

561
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,140
<i>Where shall we go, dear horses?</i>

562
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,009
<i>We shall ride to the meadows,</i>

563
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:22,091
<i>until the cockoo starts to sing.</i>

564
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,078
This would be quite enough.

565
00:33:24,447 --> 00:33:26,825
<i>We shall ride to the meadows,</i>

566
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:29,895
<i>until the cockoo starts to sing.</i>

567
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:33,245
So, the prosaic Neruda

568
00:33:33,446 --> 00:33:35,970
<i>Then the cuckoo started singing,</i>

569
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,140
<i>and my girl started crying.</i>

570
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,876
<i>Please, cuckoo, don't you sing,</i>

571
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,957
<i>and my darling, don't you cry.</i>

572
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:47,871
<i>Please, cuckoo, don't you sing,</i>

573
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:51,176
<i>and my darling, don't you cry.</i>

574
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,474
Don't you smoke?

575
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:05,574
Ugh, no.

576
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:08,918
I am a non-smoker.

577
00:34:09,353 --> 00:34:10,526
This is good.

578
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:12,357
Do you know what I said to myself

579
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:13,457
when you recited?

580
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:14,557
What?

581
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,722
No, really.

582
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:17,822
You have the feeling.

583
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,355
There is so much feeling
in the first verses.

584
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:24,962
No, really.

585
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:27,140
You have a good presentation,

586
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,373
but you need someone to
study together.

587
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:30,473
Mrs. Týfová!

588
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:31,573
You know what?
Let's try it together.

589
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:33,767
Yes?

590
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:35,715
Let's stay a bit more
after school

591
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:39,701
and I guarantee you that tomorrow
you will know it excellently.

592
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:40,985
You are very kind,

593
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,419
But I cannot today,

594
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,205
it's a mad house around me,

595
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:47,304
dinner, wife.

596
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:50,698
Icecream!
With nuts!

597
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:52,044
Acid!

598
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:53,144
Sulfuric!

599
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:55,388
Caustics!

600
00:34:55,488 --> 00:34:56,488
Boron!

601
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:57,588
Buy yourself!

602
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,307
Think about it.

603
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:00,407
It's on sale.

604
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:03,940
And then, on page 46

605
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,995
solve example 7a,

606
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:07,095
b, c,

607
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:09,657
and on page 32,

608
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:10,997
examples

609
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:12,761
d, e,

610
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:13,933
f

611
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,988
This is your homework
for the next time.

612
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:17,875
You may go.

613
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:21,369
Kroupa will stay a second.

614
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:25,869
Listen, Kroupa,

615
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,247
math is giving your dad
a hard time.

616
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:29,504
Do you learn with him together?

617
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:30,609
No.

618
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:31,709
Isn't it possible?

619
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,964
To lend a hand about it?

620
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:35,064
Well...

621
00:35:35,164 --> 00:35:36,164
It's hard.

622
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:38,452
At least the equations,

623
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:39,552
he would need some
explanation.

624
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:40,652
He doesn't know basic things -

625
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,276
removing brackets, fractions and etc.

626
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,163
Yes, but he won't allow me to explain

627
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:46,263
anything.

628
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:47,363
It's hard.

629
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:58,463
Please, Mommy!

630
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:12,163
Oh-ho, tomato sauce.

631
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:17,598
Are you home?

632
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,730
How is school?

633
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:21,517
Normal. And you?

634
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:23,169
Did you get any grades?

635
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:24,766
No. And you?

636
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:26,753
What about me?
None of your business.

637
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:28,171
What about me.

638
00:36:28,277 --> 00:36:29,277
It's about you.

639
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:34,971
I go to this school, and

640
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:38,320
I am immersed in the problematics

641
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Damn!

642
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:44,082
So I can examine you a bit.

643
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,002
Did you learn equations?

644
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,102
Yeah, we did.

645
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:49,341
Great, excellent,

646
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:51,696
I would give you

647
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:52,796
immediately

648
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:54,331
such an example

649
00:36:54,431 --> 00:37:03,186
2a-(3b-5a)=a+b

650
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,446
Dad, you must first remove
the brackets

651
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:07,953
and then you will

652
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,778
I know what I will do.
But I am interested

653
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,190
if you can do it too, well?

654
00:37:14,038 --> 00:37:16,807
I would, at first, remove the brackets.

655
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:19,587
Right.

656
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:21,954
And how?

657
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:23,908
You will..

658
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,008
I mean

659
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,108
I will do it in this way

660
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,022
I will imagine minus one before the brackets

661
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,159
and I will multiply all the numbers in the
brackets with it.

662
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:35,453
Wait, wait, don't brag so much about it

663
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,508
How did you do it?
Multiplying?

664
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:40,801
If I wouldn't get it with that -1

665
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:42,063
Then I will remember

666
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,106
that when there is a minus
before the brackets,

667
00:37:44,206 --> 00:37:46,004
then all the signs in the brackets

668
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:47,880
will change into their opposites.

669
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:49,845
Oh! But, look

670
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:53,027
before 3b there is no sign

671
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,941
If there isn't one, then it's a +

672
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:57,225
Ahaa!

673
00:37:57,325 --> 00:38:00,475
And, in this case 2a - 3b

674
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:05,923
and so on

675
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:07,023
and later?

676
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:10,567
and then you will move a+b

677
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,249
from the right to the left side.

678
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:15,782
And, how do you move from one
side to the other?

679
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,834
Do you examine me,
or I examine you?

680
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:18,934
You examine me.

681
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:20,484
that's why

682
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,134
See,

683
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,730
you are quite good with it.

684
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,067
But, don't  rest on your laurels.

685
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:37,653
to be... why am I so stupid?

686
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,405
to be

687
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,329
yes

688
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:44,407
„We jump against the bars“

689
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:47,256
„you and us we'll smash them“

690
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:51,075
„Against the bars we jump as lions“

691
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:54,052
„and we will smash them definitely“

692
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:57,600
„Against the bars we jump..“

693
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,464
Daddy, leave that alone!

694
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:01,989
It's 1:45 a.m.

695
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:35,889
Outratová!

696
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:38,205
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

697
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,305
Yes.

698
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:00,461
Špaňha!

699
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,854
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

700
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:03,954
Yeah!

701
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:05,054
What's wrong with you?

702
00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:06,154
With me? Everything!

703
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:07,254
I can't get sleep at nights.

704
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,537
You look all green to me.

705
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:20,365
Karel.

706
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:24,312
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

707
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,247
What's on the program, George?

708
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,629
Grades.

709
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,548
Is it that transport?

710
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:49,303
Rousek!

711
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:52,609
A short meeting of the studying commitee
in the afternoon.

712
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:53,709
Comrade Kroupa!

713
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:55,772
Come and see!

714
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,163
Look at it!

715
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:00,644
Look at it!

716
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:02,197
In order that the supervisor

717
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:03,808
should not get down for
every sheet of paper.

718
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,361
They put it here for him.

719
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:06,461
It goes up.

720
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,139
He signs it.

721
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,239
And then it goes down.

722
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:12,200
It's an internal telescopical transporter

723
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:13,496
of the factory mail!

724
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,763
At first - information about
my success  in school.

725
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,116
At the dictation

726
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:25,650
„Fierce jackals howled grimly“

727
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,750
we were the worst.

728
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,337
I compensated with reciting and Failed

729
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:33,657
the poem - „As lions jump against the bars“

730
00:42:33,757 --> 00:42:34,757
Another failure.

731
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:37,305
And then it follows

732
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:38,405
briefly:

733
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,622
Equations with one unknown.
Failed.

734
00:42:41,722 --> 00:42:43,460
Discontinuous functions. Failed.

735
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:44,588
Physics

736
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:46,594
Levers in balance. Satisfactory.

737
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:47,694
See!

738
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:48,794
Leave it alone.

739
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,698
What are the reasons for the crash...

740
00:42:50,798 --> 00:42:51,798
Wait, George.

741
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:54,616
You cannot speak so definitively
about a crash.

742
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,468
You have just begun.

743
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:58,591
Obviously.

744
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:02,139
What are the reasons of the crash
of the New York Stock Exchange.

745
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,239
Failed.

746
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,615
Presence of nitrogen in nature.

747
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:06,715
Satisfactory.

748
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:07,815
So

749
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:09,534
and now tell me

750
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,899
what do you plan
to do with it.

751
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,999
Look, George.

752
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,902
Aren't you a bit passive in this school?

753
00:43:16,002 --> 00:43:17,002
My boy, for example

754
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:20,148
is not an Einstein at all

755
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:22,157
but he is first to collect
recyclables.

756
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:25,491
And the teachers look at him
differently.

757
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:29,680
It's possible that those wastes
would have their role,

758
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,319
but it's not important!

759
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,200
My grades are important!

760
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Well,

761
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I think that

762
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,500
we must accept

763
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,053
that those grades are not
the ones that we promised,

764
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:41,449
but I would not perceive it

765
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:42,549
so dark.

766
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:45,937
The general view of the situation

767
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:47,818
as you sketched it

768
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:50,539
is not rosy at all.

769
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,639
Although

770
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:54,344
and we must not overlook it

771
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,809
and I would not agree with you

772
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:00,271
there are some positive sprouts,

773
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,519
I mean that nice „Satisfactory“
from nitrogen

774
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,511
and those levers in balance, no?

775
00:44:06,697 --> 00:44:09,033
These are the first birds of spring.

776
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:13,037
You let those birds fly at
your executive meetings.

777
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:15,231
Here we must recognize

778
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:16,331
that I go under!

779
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,081
And I ask you

780
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,816
Isn't it the right moment that
I, on my own,

781
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,367
voluntarily and honourably

782
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:24,706
quit school?

783
00:44:25,188 --> 00:44:26,188
Out of question.

784
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,924
Bullshit, no way.

785
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:30,890
As you wish.

786
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,098
I warned you.

787
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:36,162
So, we'll push this cart further.

788
00:44:36,262 --> 00:44:37,262
Mr. Kroupa,

789
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:39,795
I brought you the literary analysis,

790
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:43,357
but there are things, that me and
my husband could not apprehend.

791
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,522
The first line is all clear.

792
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:48,771
The poet compares man to
a lion in a cage.

793
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,994
„we yarn to fly up to the heavens“

794
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:52,874
This means, as my husband says,

795
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:55,368
that man would gladly fly to the stars,

796
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:57,619
but he is prevented from it

797
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,685
being earthbound.

798
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:01,950
Naturally, the Earth's gravity.

799
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,216
And here you can talk about

800
00:45:04,316 --> 00:45:06,766
people already flying to the stars.

801
00:45:06,866 --> 00:45:07,866
Well!

802
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:08,966
This is a bright idea!

803
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:11,041
You'll hit it right at the heart,

804
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,921
connecting it to present day.

805
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:14,944
And then, there are these
hubristics,

806
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,640
and we couldn't grasp it.

807
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,561
„Just a bit closer, you hubristic beings“

808
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:22,724
Does somebody know what are hubristics?

809
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:24,249
A hubristic?

810
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:26,657
A hubristic is a beetle.

811
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:27,757
A beetle?

812
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:29,178
A beetle.

813
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:31,145
It's a bug, that it

814
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:32,997
rolls this in front of it,

815
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:34,236
a tiny ball

816
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,103
of that -

817
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:37,727
of droppings.

818
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:41,845
You mean a pooper?

819
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:42,945
Yes, a pooper, but

820
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,157
but in biology they call it „hubristic“.

821
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:55,437
Five, failed.

822
00:45:55,879 --> 00:45:57,090
How many dumplings do you want?

823
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:58,190
Five.

824
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,290
Five?

825
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,390
What?

826
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,490
Dumplings? Six.

827
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,730
Five, failed.

828
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,269
Five or six, at last?

829
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:07,791
Six dumplings.

830
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,027
My father has a five. Flunked.

831
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:11,338
Nonsense,

832
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:13,618
you know that Father eats at the factory.

833
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:14,718
Wait.

834
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:18,106
This is his paper, I found it at school.

835
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:19,830
This is horrible.

836
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:20,930
Look, here.

837
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,022
How's that possible that he
cannot calculate?

838
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:25,202
If he would allow me to explain, but no.

839
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:26,302
Have a look!

840
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,806
the one he examined me with

841
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,730
and how does he transfer it?

842
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,810
-X, wow

843
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:35,090
He is a bonehead.

844
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,757
It's too much for him.

845
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:39,036
I am afraid that he will go crazy.

846
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:41,074
In nighttime he beats his head
against the wardrobe.

847
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:45,847
He shouts in sleep „We come! We come!“

848
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:47,457
He shouldn't have gone to this school

849
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,594
It's not for him.

850
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:53,028
Come on, if some Hujer can do it.

851
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:06,307
Is this from you, Hujer?

852
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,532
No

853
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:08,957
I know nothing about it.

854
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,639
I brought it.

855
00:47:10,938 --> 00:47:12,092
It's recyclables.

856
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:13,531
What is it?

857
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,055
Old paper,

858
00:47:15,283 --> 00:47:16,908
about 15 kg (33 lbs.)

859
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:21,738
See, we did not count on it, that

860
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,416
you would also join,
why not.

861
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:26,254
If you are into it then

862
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:28,548
but in this case it would
be necessary

863
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:30,899
to elect a team leader
for recyclables.

864
00:47:31,526 --> 00:47:33,578
Please, I would get involved.

865
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:35,003
I would dedicate

866
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:37,468
a separate notebook to it.

867
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,380
See?

868
00:47:43,637 --> 00:47:46,558
Dad won't raise a hand and won't raise a hand.

869
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:47,658
Hey, he already did raise it.

870
00:47:57,215 --> 00:47:59,509
He talks a lot.

871
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:01,760
Hey, hey, do you see it?

872
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:03,670
And he's stuck.

873
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,137
See how he scratches his nose?

874
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:08,144
He does this when he's lost.

875
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:10,509
The poet wants to express

876
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:13,729
that man is still small

877
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,422
and compares him to hubristics.

878
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:21,038
This is an unusual word, isn't it?

879
00:48:21,294 --> 00:48:22,335
So, what is it?

880
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,785
A hubristic is a

881
00:48:25,184 --> 00:48:26,409
beetle,

882
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:28,247
dung roller,

883
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:32,394
who rolls its small ball
between earth lumps.

884
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:38,520
First, we don't say „a hubristic“

885
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,401
but a „hubristic being“

886
00:48:41,926 --> 00:48:43,236
and then

887
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:50,346
your explanation of the word is
rather extravagant.

888
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:53,737
Is there someone that thinks
the same way?

889
00:48:53,837 --> 00:48:56,601
Except Maleček and Hustoles.

890
00:48:57,242 --> 00:49:00,761
See, Hustoles, we can't believe it.

891
00:49:01,346 --> 00:49:04,708
Well, is someone on the same opinion?

892
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:07,316
Yes. Great.

893
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,707
Though, it's not quite right.

894
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:13,670
Does somebody know the true meaning

895
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,893
of „hubristic being“?

896
00:49:16,263 --> 00:49:17,289
Plha

897
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,389
is raising a hand.

898
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:19,697
Well?

899
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:21,036
Mlha?

900
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:23,800
Please, I have a question.

901
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,900
Please I,

902
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:26,736
in this poem stumbled

903
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:29,457
upon a word that I don't understand.

904
00:49:29,856 --> 00:49:31,979
Which word?

905
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,860
The word

906
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,960
„a hubristic“.

907
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,937
I have never heard it.

908
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:41,753
But we are talking

909
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,149
more than 15 min.

910
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:46,312
about it, Mlha.

911
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,034
They have it entertaining there.

912
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,430
Come.

913
00:49:50,843 --> 00:49:52,396
We must go home.

914
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:55,277
Hey, Hrbola takes out his notebook.

915
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:57,283
Oh, yeah.

916
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:01,173
I hear him already

917
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,476
„What should I do with you, boy?“

918
00:50:05,832 --> 00:50:07,912
„You did not make me happy

919
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:13,141
and I won't make you happy also.“

920
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,869
What should I do with you, boy?

921
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:21,021
You did not make me happy

922
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:24,753
and I won't make you happy also.

923
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:29,042
Satisfactory.

924
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,037
Good night, Kroupa!
Good night

925
00:50:31,148 --> 00:50:32,148
Mr. Kroupa.

926
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:33,248
Yes, please.

927
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:37,320
They gave us a hard time.

928
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,420
My God,

929
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,899
such a warm evening.

930
00:50:40,184 --> 00:50:41,751
It's quite wonderful for a walk.

931
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:42,851
Yeah.

932
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:43,951
Go for it.

933
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:45,051
I'll go home

934
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:46,151
and open a window and a beer.

935
00:50:47,094 --> 00:50:48,590
Good night.

936
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:50,186
George!

937
00:50:50,286 --> 00:50:51,286
George!

938
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:52,386
What is it?

939
00:50:52,979 --> 00:50:54,119
I

940
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:56,698
have to admit something to you.

941
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:57,798
What?

942
00:50:58,761 --> 00:50:59,761
I knew that „hubristic“

943
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:02,368
was not a poop beetle.

944
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:03,950
I said it

945
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,170
because I felt sorry for you.

946
00:51:07,654 --> 00:51:09,321
You were facing it so lonely.

947
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:10,421
Whom?

948
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:13,396
That beetle of yours.

949
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:15,077
But this is not my beetle.

950
00:51:15,177 --> 00:51:17,243
Hora, that fool, gave me this advice.

951
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,708
Nobody stood up for you.

952
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,275
There was nobody

953
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,655
that you could rely upon, and

954
00:51:23,755 --> 00:51:25,892
I rushed to help you.

955
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:28,214
Look, Mrs Týfová, you are a
very sympathetic

956
00:51:28,314 --> 00:51:30,622
lady and I feel flattered

957
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:32,887
by your interest in me, but

958
00:51:32,987 --> 00:51:33,987
don't you feel

959
00:51:34,398 --> 00:51:37,005
that we are not 20 anymore?

960
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:39,199
You think that we are so old?

961
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:43,132
Certainly not. But with distant
birthdays. Good night.

962
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,280
The pooper beetle!

963
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:01,711
Stop! You!

964
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:02,811
You!

965
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,206
Thank you frankly for the help.

966
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,671
You cannot possibly imagine my success.

967
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:13,081
With your knowledge.

968
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:16,244
But I did think that it was a beetle, yes.

969
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:19,080
And if you have another brilliant idea, share it.

970
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,126
I will brag about it at school.

971
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:28,668
We collected this from all around the offices.

972
00:52:28,996 --> 00:52:31,604
There is about 40 kg (18 lbs.)

973
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:33,071
This is great!

974
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:34,171
Great help!

975
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:37,573
The recyclables team leader with the highest quantity

976
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:40,124
will be rewarded.

977
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:42,290
Last time we

978
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,390
detected metal elements

979
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,490
in solutions.

980
00:52:46,137 --> 00:52:47,975
Please, pay attention.

981
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:50,041
So,

982
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,773
And now we'll test

983
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:56,552
if there is sodium inside.

984
00:52:58,518 --> 00:52:59,601
Attention,

985
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:03,351
<i>We'll meet at the cemetery.
G.K.</i>

986
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:04,222
The liquid is being coloured.

987
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:05,542
Calm.

988
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:07,323
Don't disturb.

989
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:13,578
And we'll prepare another solution.

990
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:15,089
So,

991
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:25,646
and, hm

992
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,488
carefully,

993
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:34,851
carefully, in this manner

994
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,063
Silence. Don't disturb.

995
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:45,266
What's your name?

996
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:46,591
Matula

997
00:53:46,745 --> 00:53:47,745
What dou you carry?

998
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:49,497
I don't know.

999
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,034
And now we'll detect

1000
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:54,470
the presence of potassium.

1001
00:53:54,812 --> 00:53:57,006
Knock. Knock.

1002
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,340
Silence.

1003
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Don't disturb.

1004
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:03,646
Take!

1005
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,582
It is dissolving.

1006
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:14,845
What's with you today?

1007
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:16,896
Please, comrade Professor,

1008
00:54:16,996 --> 00:54:18,492
there is a student from another class.

1009
00:54:18,977 --> 00:54:20,202
What?

1010
00:54:23,704 --> 00:54:24,704
Are you here a long time?

1011
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:25,804
Aha.

1012
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:26,904
What are you saying?

1013
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:27,004
Are you here a long time?

1014
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:28,004
Yes, please.

1015
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:30,076
Let me see what you've got.

1016
00:54:34,177 --> 00:54:35,177
Who sent you with this?

1017
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:37,057
The comrade Director.

1018
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:38,838
And you have to give it to me?

1019
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:40,976
You have to write it on the blackboard.

1020
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,470
Write down:

1021
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,220


1022
00:55:03,459 --> 00:55:04,585
Thanks, bye.

1023
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:05,685
Bye.

1024
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:13,435
<i>A meeting with parents and friends
of the School, 20th 19:00 The Headmaster</i>

1025
00:55:13,604 --> 00:55:15,128
This should not be valid vor us, this

1026
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,279
Why not? Just write it down.

1027
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:18,776
Everybody, write it down.

1028
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:21,525
Kroupa, they must be out of their mind!

1029
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:23,463
My parents are in Kojčice, this is

1030
00:55:23,563 --> 00:55:24,959
far away, at Pelhřimov.

1031
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,355
Such a distance, and now

1032
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:28,706
travelling is not for free, too.

1033
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:31,214
But it's totally logical.

1034
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:33,821
Our families must be informed

1035
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,486
of our progress in school.

1036
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:45,305
Sit down.

1037
00:55:47,742 --> 00:55:49,423
Plha is raising a hand.

1038
00:55:49,523 --> 00:55:50,523
PLease, I have a question.

1039
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,629
This message on the board,

1040
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:54,609
about the parents' meeting,

1041
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,131
is it valid for us?

1042
00:55:58,057 --> 00:56:00,123
The orders of the headmaster

1043
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,289
are always valid.

1044
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:03,999
But no,

1045
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,250
this is too much...

1046
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:10,966
Don't forget that at 50, one learns with
an effort.

1047
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:12,818
It doesn't get so easy in the head.

1048
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:15,169
I wouldn't criticize him for his difficulties.

1049
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:16,822
You have troubles on your mind, don't you?

1050
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,515
Something else is bothering me.

1051
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:22,336
I promise myself, that if I am to have kids,

1052
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,601
If we are going to have kids.

1053
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:26,268
If we are going to have kids.

1054
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,691
then I won't be ashamed to ask

1055
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:29,791
Do you want twins?

1056
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:30,891
Wait.

1057
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:33,777
Shortly, if we were to have kids

1058
00:56:33,877 --> 00:56:36,399
I won't ever be ashamed to ask

1059
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:37,499
Hey, Pete...

1060
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,599
No, not Pete!

1061
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:42,611
OK, then, hey Theophilus,

1062
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:44,477
I can't solve equations with two unknowns,

1063
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:45,646
please explain.

1064
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:46,817
And,

1065
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,239
and he will explain.

1066
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:50,462
If this Theophilus is after me,

1067
00:56:50,562 --> 00:56:52,798
then he won't be able to.

1068
00:56:54,508 --> 00:56:57,329
Two circles in a plain may have
two intersection points

1069
00:56:57,429 --> 00:57:00,022
one intersection point
or none at all.

1070
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:01,646
In the first case,

1071
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:04,980
the sum of the radiuses is smaller
than the distance between centres.

1072
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,887
and the difference between radiuses
is smaller than the distance between centres.

1073
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:09,554
In the second case,

1074
00:57:09,654 --> 00:57:13,800
the distance between the centres is
equal to the sum of the radiuses.

1075
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,170
In the third case...

1076
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,270
Listen to him.

1077
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,544
If for A, for A

1078
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,479
if the sum of the radiuses

1079
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:23,446
is smaller than the distance between the centres

1080
00:57:23,546 --> 00:57:27,321
And the difference of the radiuses is greater or equal to the

1081
00:57:27,421 --> 00:57:30,926
distance between the centres of the circles.

1082
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:34,744
In this case, one of the circles is situated
inside the other.

1083
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:38,321
Basically it was right, except for a small inaccuracy.

1084
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,156
Come and draw it, so we can see it graphically.

1085
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:42,256
Please.

1086
00:57:54,706 --> 00:57:56,359
What happened, who went out?

1087
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:58,211
Týfová was not feeling well.

1088
00:57:58,311 --> 00:58:01,060
Please, go and have a look.

1089
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,762
I am going.

1090
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:10,108
What happened to you?

1091
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,408
Who sent you this?

1092
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:16,662
Kroupa.

1093
00:58:17,446 --> 00:58:19,754
What a cynic.

1094
00:58:19,854 --> 00:58:22,732
Asshole.

1095
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,980
Kroupa, lend me the drafting compass.

1096
00:58:26,092 --> 00:58:27,092
I need it.

1097
00:58:27,562 --> 00:58:30,967
Come on, draw with a coin.

1098
00:58:32,577 --> 00:58:35,712
Don't you have your own?

1099
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:40,513
Why don't you buy one?

1100
00:59:05,772 --> 00:59:06,772
I welcome you.

1101
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:08,368
I welcome you, comrades.

1102
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:10,363
I welcome you.

1103
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,463
Welcome

1104
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:14,039
Welcome.

1105
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:16,418
You must have come to see

1106
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:18,798
our factory?

1107
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:20,351
Please, tell me

1108
00:59:20,451 --> 00:59:22,288
what would be your interest in us.

1109
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:23,388
So,

1110
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:24,488
I am in charge here

1111
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:25,588
in general

1112
00:59:26,677 --> 00:59:27,677
respectively

1113
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:28,777
quite soon.

1114
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:29,877
My name is Hujer,

1115
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:30,977
Hujer

1116
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:32,903
Well, so

1117
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:34,855
Here, behind me, you see

1118
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:35,955
this is the old workshop

1119
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:37,534
and there

1120
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,158
we are building a new one

1121
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:40,768
entirely automatic

1122
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,635
and it will be, will be

1123
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:44,814
the beating heart of our plant.

1124
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,425
You have ecountered our

1125
00:59:46,525 --> 00:59:48,462
machines in the fields

1126
00:59:48,562 --> 00:59:50,072
and you didn't expect

1127
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:51,172
that bolt by bolt,

1128
00:59:51,272 --> 00:59:52,480
the Holy Truth,

1129
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,580
was born here.

1130
00:59:55,427 --> 00:59:57,353
And there, it is the sprout

1131
00:59:57,735 --> 00:59:58,735
of the new one.

1132
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:02,183
He was asking about you

1133
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:03,992
What do you do, what obligations

1134
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:05,092
How was his name, again?

1135
01:00:05,192 --> 01:00:06,942
Týfa, engineer Týfa.

1136
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:10,147
I don't know Týfa.
I go with Týfová to school.

1137
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:12,513
So dear friends, I welcome you

1138
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:16,502
to our factory. [translation in
Romanian]

1139
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:19,779
This is our deputy Director Kalivoda.

1140
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,239
My name is Kroupa

1141
01:00:24,395 --> 01:00:26,917
and I am the supervisor.

1142
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:30,508
Hujer, mind your job!

1143
01:00:41,006 --> 01:00:42,006
Hi, Daddy.

1144
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,106
Hi.

1145
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:44,206
What's up?

1146
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,166
Did you do something to Mum?

1147
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:48,304
Me? No. Why?

1148
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:50,028
She behaves strangely.

1149
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:52,635
Doesn't speak, just walks around

1150
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:04,903
shines the mirrors and
disappears again.

1151
01:01:05,387 --> 01:01:06,741
Maybe she wants them clean.

1152
01:01:06,841 --> 01:01:09,177
Come on, they are shiny like a...

1153
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:11,072
Didn't she say something before?

1154
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,494
Nothing interesting. Although,

1155
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,719
Somebody, engineer Týfa called

1156
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:27,072
and when she put down the phone,

1157
01:01:27,172 --> 01:01:29,067
she looked haunted.

1158
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,931
Man, this doesn't

1159
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,971
look good.

1160
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,832
It doesn't come

1161
01:01:53,788 --> 01:01:54,788
by itself.

1162
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:55,888
Did you ask her?

1163
01:01:56,324 --> 01:01:57,324
I asked, but

1164
01:01:57,424 --> 01:02:00,185
she would say the same -
nothing!

1165
01:02:06,354 --> 01:02:07,765
Mommy,

1166
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:11,555
why do you shine those mirrors
all the time?

1167
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:14,191
In order to see by yourself what
a prick you are.

1168
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:23,908
Oh, well,

1169
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,732
must we deal with such problems

1170
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:28,082
even among grown ups.

1171
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:30,476
If I am concerned, Mr. Director

1172
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:32,599
I would throw it in the bin, but

1173
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:34,437
the husband of Mrs. Týfová insists

1174
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:36,774
that we elaborate on this and
for Kroupa to apologize.

1175
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,070
Hi, Kroupa.

1176
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,535
Did they call you too?

1177
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:41,635
No, where?

1178
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:43,014
I am going to Latin.
Where did they call you?

1179
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:44,114
To the Director.

1180
01:02:44,214 --> 01:02:45,214
What do they want?

1181
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:47,260
About those poor grades in math

1182
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,953
they will suggest that I leave school.

1183
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:51,919
And I'll say to Hrbolek

1184
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:53,316
that Latin is not for me.

1185
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,812
„laudo, laudare“

1186
01:02:54,912 --> 01:02:57,391
What to do with this
at the drill mill.

1187
01:02:57,491 --> 01:02:59,400
I cannot imagine at all

1188
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,705
how should we discuss it with him

1189
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:04,728
Enter!

1190
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:06,410
Good afternoon

1191
01:03:07,606 --> 01:03:08,647
I am Kroupa

1192
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:10,670
They told me that I come here.

1193
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,579
Sit down, comrade Kroupa.

1194
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:13,679
Thank you.

1195
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:25,103
Listen, I don't know

1196
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:27,465
if you are aware of the reason
why you have been invited

1197
01:03:27,565 --> 01:03:28,565
Well,

1198
01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:31,486
I can guess.

1199
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:35,105
So, it would be easier to talk about it.

1200
01:03:36,003 --> 01:03:39,422
I certainly don't think that you have planned it

1201
01:03:39,522 --> 01:03:42,571
I did not plan anything, I was

1202
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:45,720
I was persuaded to do it.

1203
01:03:46,005 --> 01:03:48,256
Who persuaded you?

1204
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:49,652
Hora,

1205
01:03:49,752 --> 01:03:51,647
Outratová, Rousek

1206
01:03:51,747 --> 01:03:53,058
Write down those names!

1207
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:55,722
You cannot possibly know them, they are from the factory

1208
01:03:55,822 --> 01:03:58,600
and I would appreciate if they don't get trouble from this.

1209
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,623
They had good intentions.

1210
01:04:00,723 --> 01:04:02,148
I also think that it was rather a

1211
01:04:02,248 --> 01:04:04,983
misunderstanding, than

1212
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:06,083
Well,

1213
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:08,032
I told them immediately,

1214
01:04:08,132 --> 01:04:10,882
that it doesn't make sense.

1215
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:13,618
And I am ready to drop it immediately.

1216
01:04:13,718 --> 01:04:16,980
We consider it obvious,
that you won't repeat it ever.

1217
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,701
And it would be necessary
for you to apologize.

1218
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:21,796
It's enough that I go away, what

1219
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,620
apology do you need?

1220
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,814
If I have insulted you personally,

1221
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,353
because I've been here, please

1222
01:04:27,453 --> 01:04:30,687
accept my deepest apologies.

1223
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:32,297
Wait, comrade Kroupa.

1224
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:33,397
We don't understand each other.

1225
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:36,001
Nobody wants from you to quit school.

1226
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:37,910
But the lady comrade was clear about it.

1227
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:40,133
It's only about dealing with

1228
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,470
the note to Mrs. Týfová

1229
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:45,134
with some tact.

1230
01:04:45,832 --> 01:04:47,414
Yes. Exactly.

1231
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:56,105
We are maybe the same age

1232
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:57,205
aren't we?

1233
01:04:57,305 --> 01:04:59,781
Isn't it a bit boyish at our age.

1234
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:02,303
This comrade husband, this Tyfa,

1235
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:04,511
he rightfully considers it an insult.

1236
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:07,105
First, you tell her in the eye that she's old,

1237
01:05:07,205 --> 01:05:08,205
and later write to her

1238
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,305
„We'll meet at the cemetery.“

1239
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:12,961
It is cynical.

1240
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:15,297
Look,

1241
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,734
the International Day of Women is approaching.

1242
01:05:18,118 --> 01:05:20,512
You gave her a nice gift.

1243
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:21,880
This piece of paper

1244
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,131
I see for the first time in my life.

1245
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:26,111
You cannot talk?

1246
01:05:26,211 --> 01:05:28,249
You must write letters to each other?

1247
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:30,229
„At the cemetery“!

1248
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,583
Such,

1249
01:05:31,683 --> 01:05:33,421
such shame!

1250
01:05:34,518 --> 01:05:36,755
And I have to run around and explain!

1251
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:39,163
As if I don't have worries of my own.

1252
01:05:39,263 --> 01:05:40,263
Please, don't shout.

1253
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:41,958
Good afternoon.

1254
01:05:42,058 --> 01:05:43,058
Hi.

1255
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:46,087
They called me to the Headmaster's office

1256
01:05:46,187 --> 01:05:47,187
investigating

1257
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,937
as if I were some kind of a rascal.

1258
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:50,376
Wait, it's here somewhere.

1259
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:52,542
Hey, 84

1260
01:05:58,939 --> 01:05:59,979
Ring.

1261
01:06:03,937 --> 01:06:04,937
Emil!

1262
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:06,448
The bell!

1263
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,514
Open!

1264
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,679
What is it, darling?

1265
01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:12,531
Don't you see that I am in the sauna?

1266
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,925
I am studying!

1267
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:18,675


1268
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,207
Eh, do you see?

1269
01:06:27,478 --> 01:06:29,073
„A happy home“

1270
01:06:29,415 --> 01:06:31,781
And you nearly destroyed it.

1271
01:06:38,876 --> 01:06:40,244
Oh, my God!

1272
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,963
He's naked!

1273
01:06:44,063 --> 01:06:45,929
Poor Mrs. Týfová.

1274
01:06:46,371 --> 01:06:47,439
Are you looking for someone?

1275
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:48,892
I am Kroupa.

1276
01:06:48,992 --> 01:06:49,992
Aha.

1277
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,697
A fellow student of your wife.

1278
01:06:53,053 --> 01:06:54,278
And this is my son

1279
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:56,187
who came here to explain something.

1280
01:06:56,287 --> 01:06:57,287
Aha.

1281
01:06:57,387 --> 01:06:58,387
Aha.

1282
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:04,551
Please. Obviously. I'll open the door.

1283
01:07:04,936 --> 01:07:06,247
Come inside.

1284
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:10,236
It's not necessary. We'll do it quickly.

1285
01:07:10,521 --> 01:07:12,459
It would be more appropriate,

1286
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,753
if I understand it well,

1287
01:07:14,853 --> 01:07:16,990
if it's about that

1288
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:18,258
apology,

1289
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:20,737
that my wife would be

1290
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:22,333
present too.

1291
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:26,151
It's not an apology, but an explanation.

1292
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,251
What is your name?

1293
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:28,351
George Kroupa.

1294
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:30,739
Pay attention, please, that he has
the same initials as me:

1295
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:31,839
G.K.

1296
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,344
Whom did you write that note to?

1297
01:07:34,444 --> 01:07:35,444
A girl from our class.

1298
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:36,544
What is her name?

1299
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,262
Eva Tůmová.

1300
01:07:38,362 --> 01:07:40,370
Take into account, please -
„Eva. T.“

1301
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:43,092
What did you write in that note?

1302
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:45,129
We'll meet at the cemetery.

1303
01:07:45,414 --> 01:07:47,765
Did you intend to suggest that she is old,

1304
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:48,865
about to die?

1305
01:07:49,373 --> 01:07:50,373
No.

1306
01:07:50,473 --> 01:07:52,011
What did you think about?

1307
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:53,279
Well, that,

1308
01:07:53,379 --> 01:07:54,379
to come to the cemetery.

1309
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:56,699
We usually meet there.

1310
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,893
Pay attention, please, that my
son is dating a girl schoolmate

1311
01:07:58,993 --> 01:08:00,987
at the cemetery, among the graves.

1312
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,210
So, if I understand it well,

1313
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,162
Yes, you understand it quite well -

1314
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:07,641
I did not write that note at all and it
was not addressed to your wife,

1315
01:08:07,769 --> 01:08:09,821
whom I greet from my heart.
It was a pleasure.

1316
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:10,921
I was honoured. Come.

1317
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:24,539
Týfa took it with dignity,

1318
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:25,836
as Cicero,

1319
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:26,936
nearly naked.

1320
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:29,768
George explained everything.

1321
01:08:29,868 --> 01:08:33,644
and now everything is in
ultimate order.

1322
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:35,439
Wait, now I see

1323
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:36,539
you have a girlfriend!

1324
01:08:37,021 --> 01:08:38,146
Yes, I have.

1325
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:39,246
And how old are you?

1326
01:08:40,352 --> 01:08:41,352
You, boy!

1327
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:42,820
When I was as old as you are...

1328
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,515
But, Daddy.

1329
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,992
I did not finish. What?

1330
01:08:48,647 --> 01:08:50,442
When I was old as you are now,

1331
01:08:50,855 --> 01:08:53,050
I also did have, naturally, a girlfriend.

1332
01:09:04,616 --> 01:09:06,186
I have to go.

1333
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,318
It's high time.

1334
01:09:13,211 --> 01:09:15,077
Mom, is this brown sweater OK?

1335
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:16,177
Yes.

1336
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,012
So, you also are going out?

1337
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,591
We go to parents meeting.

1338
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,956
It's enough that I'll be there, no?

1339
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:25,435
We are going to ask about you, Daddy.

1340
01:09:25,535 --> 01:09:27,487
I spoke to Mrs. Tuček and to Mrs. Šlajs.

1341
01:09:27,587 --> 01:09:28,969
Everybody is coming.

1342
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,408
Please, this is

1343
01:09:30,508 --> 01:09:31,847
completely unnecessary,

1344
01:09:31,947 --> 01:09:33,585
I tell everything at home.

1345
01:09:33,827 --> 01:09:35,380
Come on, we'll do it gladly.

1346
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,290
We don't need the school to tell us

1347
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,829
that we are not interested in you.

1348
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:40,168
What are you saying?

1349
01:09:40,268 --> 01:09:43,160
They won't let you in, look,

1350
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:44,585
Here

1351
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,360
„A parents and friends of the school meeting“

1352
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,170
Are you some parent?

1353
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,005
I am a friend of the school.

1354
01:09:53,675 --> 01:09:55,712
He'll solve the example, but

1355
01:09:55,812 --> 01:09:58,633
often will make a simple mistake from haste.

1356
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:01,554
His grades are quite decent:

1357
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:04,033
arithmetic: Excellent, Excellent-

1358
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,242
and Satisfactory, just as I said

1359
01:10:06,342 --> 01:10:07,342
And George Kroupa,

1360
01:10:07,442 --> 01:10:08,442
if you'll be kind,

1361
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,542
Mr. Professor.

1362
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:11,542
Sorry, it closed.

1363
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:15,289
Kroupa knows math, it's in order.

1364
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:16,389
Here he is.

1365
01:10:18,353 --> 01:10:19,521
Although,

1366
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:23,211
lately, I haven't noticed,

1367
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:26,346
Test Failed, again Failed, orally Satisfactory

1368
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:31,005
These are maybe my grades, Mr. Professor.

1369
01:10:31,105 --> 01:10:33,370
Ha-ha. Yes

1370
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:35,593
Wrong page.

1371
01:10:35,693 --> 01:10:38,385
This is about another student
from another class.

1372
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:41,449
He's good, as I say. Very good, Excellent, Excellent

1373
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:42,549
You can be satisfied.

1374
01:10:43,187 --> 01:10:46,165
I know. With the son.

1375
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,575
Please, colleague,

1376
01:10:47,675 --> 01:10:49,769
for a moment.

1377
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,263
Excuse me.

1378
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,010
Did you call them?

1379
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:57,110
Who?

1380
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,532
The family members.

1381
01:10:58,632 --> 01:10:59,632
These here?

1382
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:01,681
No, those old ladies, children, brothers-in-law

1383
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:03,704
of the students from the evening school

1384
01:11:03,804 --> 01:11:04,804
I know nothing.

1385
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:07,123
Didn't you notice the crowd in the corridors?

1386
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:08,719
I sent them to the drawing room.

1387
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:10,372
Now, they are sitting and waiting.

1388
01:11:10,472 --> 01:11:11,683
Please, comrades,

1389
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:12,783
he did not call them,

1390
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:13,937
what shall we do?

1391
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:15,330
I think that Janda as a class teacher

1392
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,627
should take care of it.

1393
01:11:16,727 --> 01:11:17,952
But I am not ready here.

1394
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:21,158
It doesn't matter, please finish it quickly

1395
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:22,258
Yes.

1396
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:23,694
and I will calm them down.

1397
01:11:23,794 --> 01:11:26,430
And you in your classes, also give it some speed

1398
01:11:26,544 --> 01:11:28,809
and come quickly there.

1399
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,958
and give info on grades, and etc.

1400
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:33,058
But I don't understand...

1401
01:11:33,297 --> 01:11:34,921
Speed it up, speed it up!

1402
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:36,403
Please, please.

1403
01:11:36,503 --> 01:11:37,503
Yes.

1404
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:42,045
Dear friends,

1405
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:44,268
I, as a headmaster,

1406
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,776
would like to express my satisfaction,

1407
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,770
that you have come here,

1408
01:11:49,269 --> 01:11:50,922
in such great numbers.

1409
01:11:51,022 --> 01:11:52,022
Believe,

1410
01:11:52,122 --> 01:11:53,729
we did not expect it.

1411
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:55,738
Although we suspected it,

1412
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,690
when we prepared for it,

1413
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:00,368
that it won't pass unnoticed.

1414
01:12:00,468 --> 01:12:01,468
You know,

1415
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,771
the cooperation of school and family

1416
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:07,521
is very imortant.

1417
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:09,573
It is not only about

1418
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:11,581
basic behaviour,

1419
01:12:11,681 --> 01:12:13,462
formation of the individual,

1420
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,070
but also for some known issues

1421
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,170
not very noticeable, but

1422
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:19,632
important details,

1423
01:12:19,732 --> 01:12:20,732
Look,

1424
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,120
They would often go dirty to school.

1425
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:25,220
I have instructed

1426
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,582
the comrade janitor

1427
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:30,688
that the most notorious slatterns,

1428
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:32,398
excuse my language,

1429
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:34,108
he would pull for the ears

1430
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,889
and take back home.

1431
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:37,513
Obviously, it concerns

1432
01:12:37,613 --> 01:12:40,348
younger students, especially.

1433
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:41,958
And, here,

1434
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:44,366
this was my introduction.

1435
01:12:44,722 --> 01:12:47,344
And here we have the class teacher

1436
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:49,795
and he will deal with it

1437
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:50,895
by himself

1438
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:54,226
and will be more precise.

1439
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,050
Please.

1440
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:03,943
What class are you looking for?

1441
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:05,638
Good evening.

1442
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,462
I received a letter from my nephew

1443
01:13:07,562 --> 01:13:09,571
that there was a meeting

1444
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:10,839
What's his name?

1445
01:13:10,939 --> 01:13:11,939
Hujer.

1446
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:14,173
He attends the evening school.

1447
01:13:14,315 --> 01:13:15,854
Here, behind the corner, in the drawing room.

1448
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:19,103
Thank you. You are very kind.

1449
01:13:22,366 --> 01:13:24,018
Please. Please, sir.

1450
01:13:24,118 --> 01:13:26,198
Where is Hujer's class?

1451
01:13:26,298 --> 01:13:28,920
Stairs up and right. It's the drawing room.

1452
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,020
Thank you.

1453
01:13:31,667 --> 01:13:32,667
What are you doing here?

1454
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:34,448
We come for uncle Hujer.

1455
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:35,548
We want to ask...

1456
01:13:35,648 --> 01:13:37,554
Next floor, drawing room.

1457
01:13:37,654 --> 01:13:38,851
Excuse me...

1458
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:41,843
Hujer.  Next floor, drawing room.

1459
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:48,496
I cannot make any compromise

1460
01:13:48,596 --> 01:13:52,600
At this school the technical subjects are the most important.

1461
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,700
And you?

1462
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,507
Hujer, Robert.

1463
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:57,914
The older brother of Viktor Hujer.

1464
01:13:58,014 --> 01:13:59,638
Hujer, he is

1465
01:13:59,824 --> 01:14:02,146
a very dedicated student, but

1466
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:06,834
his ability of independent thinking is weaker

1467
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:10,096
but his diligence, untamed,

1468
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:12,918
he will get the grades, don't worry.

1469
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:15,098
What did he say?

1470
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:17,534
That he'll graduate.

1471
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,885
You?

1472
01:14:19,985 --> 01:14:21,481
I am Zelenková, Hujer's sister.

1473
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:22,581
Well, you've heard it.

1474
01:14:23,003 --> 01:14:24,003
You?

1475
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:25,103
I am Hujerová.

1476
01:14:25,203 --> 01:14:26,203
Wife?

1477
01:14:26,303 --> 01:14:27,303
No, I am the wife.

1478
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:29,517
I am his sister-in-law.

1479
01:14:29,617 --> 01:14:30,617
You?

1480
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:31,717
I am his cousin.

1481
01:14:32,779 --> 01:14:33,779
And you?

1482
01:14:33,879 --> 01:14:34,879
Hujerová, wife.

1483
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:35,979
But the wife is...

1484
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,367
I am from the first marriage.

1485
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:38,934
OK, then

1486
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:40,701
So, that everyone can hear me.

1487
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:43,180
What is the Hujers' range?

1488
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:46,144
Hujer? Does he study here?

1489
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:51,102
Hey, Máňa! From Čáslav!

1490
01:14:55,118 --> 01:14:56,716
Silence, please!

1491
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:08,684
Sit.

1492
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:12,574
You are?

1493
01:15:13,828 --> 01:15:15,124
From Kojčice,

1494
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:17,276
near Pelhřimov.

1495
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:20,296
And who are you interested in?

1496
01:15:20,781 --> 01:15:21,792
Our son.

1497
01:15:22,263 --> 01:15:23,602
Plha,

1498
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:25,867
Mr. Teacher.

1499
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:30,213
He is „Very good“.

1500
01:15:32,037 --> 01:15:33,333
Very good.

1501
01:15:33,618 --> 01:15:34,772
Very good.

1502
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:35,872
Let's go.

1503
01:15:38,178 --> 01:15:39,873
God bless you.

1504
01:15:46,453 --> 01:15:47,453
Hello.

1505
01:15:49,175 --> 01:15:50,175
What's for dinner.

1506
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:51,275
Come.

1507
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:54,435
I asked about you.

1508
01:15:54,535 --> 01:15:56,201
You are OK with math

1509
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,054


1510
01:15:58,154 --> 01:15:59,892
and then you have a Good in history.

1511
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:02,114
You'll have to fix it.

1512
01:16:02,425 --> 01:16:03,425
So what?

1513
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:04,525
Will there be a soup?

1514
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,762
Wait, father.

1515
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,198
We asked about you.

1516
01:16:08,298 --> 01:16:10,592
And we won't eat because of it?

1517
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:12,572
Aren't you interested how it went?

1518
01:16:12,672 --> 01:16:13,672
Of course.

1519
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:16,035
Turnout was abundant, yes?

1520
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:18,941
14 people came for Hujer.

1521
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,078
Wait, seriously,

1522
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,902
it's tragic for you in math

1523
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:25,367
I know, this is no big news,

1524
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:28,089
You could ask me and not go to school.

1525
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,585
I don't want to keep you accountable for it, but

1526
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:31,522
It's the last thing that would happen

1527
01:16:31,622 --> 01:16:33,716
that you keep me accountable, what?

1528
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:35,768
Let George speak, please.

1529
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:37,521
As if somebody is stopping him.

1530
01:16:37,621 --> 01:16:40,043
Please talk, so that your mother won't go crazy.

1531
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:41,838
Come, we'll learn together.

1532
01:16:41,938 --> 01:16:43,590
Every evening, two hours

1533
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:44,690
or three, well?

1534
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,192
It's only about mathematics.

1535
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:49,292
Father,

1536
01:16:49,392 --> 01:16:50,392
think about it

1537
01:16:50,928 --> 01:16:52,795
the boy means only well.

1538
01:16:52,895 --> 01:16:53,895
Well,

1539
01:16:53,995 --> 01:16:55,744
You are very kind, sonny

1540
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:56,844
but with this

1541
01:16:56,944 --> 01:16:58,836
I must deal alone,

1542
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:00,902
you know that we would fight

1543
01:17:01,058 --> 01:17:02,298
and that I would be nervous.

1544
01:17:02,754 --> 01:17:05,290
And then you have your own issues.

1545
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,971
Get better with history.

1546
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:08,767
It's also important

1547
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:11,260
because, if someone doesn't know history,

1548
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,654
it's worse than not knowing

1549
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:14,810
biology.

1550
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:15,910
You are so stubborn!

1551
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,985
I shouln't give you any soup.

1552
01:17:18,085 --> 01:17:19,085
As you wish!

1553
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:20,478
I can go to a restaurant.

1554
01:17:20,578 --> 01:17:23,342
I still have enough for a soup!

1555
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:29,982
Hujer,

1556
01:17:30,082 --> 01:17:31,535
One minute before break's end

1557
01:17:31,635 --> 01:17:33,416
you must tell Janda to come to class

1558
01:17:33,743 --> 01:17:36,208
Maybe his watch is broken.

1559
01:17:36,308 --> 01:17:37,308
Me?

1560
01:17:37,408 --> 01:17:38,408
Why me exactly?

1561
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:41,551
He said that you are the most trustworthy

1562
01:17:41,964 --> 01:17:42,976
True.

1563
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,529
But, I'll have to...

1564
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:45,629
Oh, yes.

1565
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:46,980
Not to make a mistake.

1566
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,080
You know what to do.

1567
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,285
2 min. 30 sec.!

1568
01:17:50,385 --> 01:17:51,385
Better go.

1569
01:17:54,728 --> 01:17:55,728
Enter.

1570
01:17:56,868 --> 01:17:58,236
Enter.

1571
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,597
Comrade Professor,

1572
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,133
there is a minute to class.

1573
01:18:10,688 --> 01:18:11,900
And what?

1574
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:14,578
The class will start.

1575
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:16,844
Yes.

1576
01:18:17,553 --> 01:18:18,553
Yes.

1577
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:20,363
It's time, we must go.

1578
01:18:22,415 --> 01:18:24,067
Listen, Hujer,

1579
01:18:24,338 --> 01:18:27,629
I can't say you lack diligence,

1580
01:18:27,729 --> 01:18:29,524
but at the moment it is almost

1581
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:31,633
insolence.

1582
01:18:33,813 --> 01:18:35,238
Is it fast?

1583
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:36,933
I set them this morning

1584
01:18:37,033 --> 01:18:38,033
to the radio.

1585
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:44,385
He's coming!

1586
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:55,655
Hujer, how come that your things are not ready?

1587
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,077
I had to remind you, and had no time.

1588
01:18:58,177 --> 01:19:00,329
Please, excuse me, I otherwise always...

1589
01:19:00,429 --> 01:19:02,295
Next time, take care of yourself.

1590
01:19:02,395 --> 01:19:04,788
I will take care of my duties.

1591
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:07,453
Everybody sit.

1592
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:11,884
Thanks, I have my own.

1593
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,640
Kroupa to the blackboard, please!

1594
01:19:20,945 --> 01:19:22,912
You have an angle Beta...

1595
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:24,992
No, I don't have.

1596
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:29,608
You have an angle Beta, and sides A and B

1597
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,959
Draw a triangle.

1598
01:19:46,506 --> 01:19:48,002
Side A

1599
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:49,869
And now

1600
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:52,391
we draw

1601
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,386
side

1602
01:19:55,939 --> 01:19:57,492
side

1603
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,364
side B.

1604
01:20:06,283 --> 01:20:07,323
Side B.

1605
01:20:10,927 --> 01:20:12,010
How do you know that

1606
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:13,335
side B goes this way?

1607
01:20:13,435 --> 01:20:15,815
I don't see the angle.

1608
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,536
Plha is raising a hand.

1609
01:20:18,764 --> 01:20:20,003
I have a question.

1610
01:20:20,217 --> 01:20:21,799
How could he know that

1611
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:24,463
side B will go this way?

1612
01:20:24,876 --> 01:20:26,486
Please, sit.

1613
01:20:26,686 --> 01:20:28,381
Comrade Kroupa, these are basic things.

1614
01:20:28,481 --> 01:20:30,632
You must know this unconditionally.

1615
01:20:31,986 --> 01:20:33,496
By the way, not to forget

1616
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,406
Yesterday at the council we agreed

1617
01:20:35,506 --> 01:20:36,506
that those students, who feel

1618
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:39,637
that they won't make it through school

1619
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,701
I don't mean directly you,

1620
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:45,265
Have the possibility to

1621
01:20:45,365 --> 01:20:46,847
leave school on their own desire.

1622
01:20:46,947 --> 01:20:48,158
in order to avoid

1623
01:20:48,258 --> 01:20:52,403
the unpleasant fact of dropping out.

1624
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,583
What are you doing?

1625
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:07,136
Feeding them.

1626
01:21:07,386 --> 01:21:09,386
Don't you want something for them?

1627
01:21:09,636 --> 01:21:10,636
No.

1628
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:14,018
Yeah, I wanted to...

1629
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,556
Listen,

1630
01:21:15,656 --> 01:21:17,850
let's not speak generally about

1631
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:20,287
two hours of learning together

1632
01:21:20,771 --> 01:21:24,761
it has to make sense

1633
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:26,314
I was thinking

1634
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:27,414
what would you say about

1635
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:31,486
between 8 and 10 in the evenings?

1636
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:34,335
Is it OK with you? Is it?

1637
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:37,000
If not, then tell me.

1638
01:21:44,081 --> 01:21:45,534
Don't you smoke?

1639
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:50,478
No.

1640
01:21:50,835 --> 01:21:54,012
When I smoke, I throw up

1641
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:08,246
You, Hujer.

1642
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,107
Šlajs knows about a locomotive.

1643
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:12,207
Come on!

1644
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:14,372
Don't you say anything about a locomotive.

1645
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:15,569
This is again some kind of a

1646
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:17,122
joke.

1647
01:22:17,222 --> 01:22:18,818
No, Really, Šlajs found it.

1648
01:22:18,918 --> 01:22:19,918
An old one.

1649
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,810
And if we take it for the recyclables,

1650
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:24,631
I know your ideas.

1651
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:25,731
You are...

1652
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:26,831
like little kids

1653
01:22:26,931 --> 01:22:29,717
Don't be an asshole, this is 20 t. of iron.

1654
01:22:29,817 --> 01:22:31,798
Immediately, it's first place in the republic in recyclables.

1655
01:22:31,898 --> 01:22:32,898
Really.

1656
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:34,904
Bring it.

1657
01:22:35,004 --> 01:22:36,004
I'll weight it

1658
01:22:36,426 --> 01:22:37,426
and write it down.

1659
01:22:37,526 --> 01:22:38,526
You don't want it? OK

1660
01:22:38,836 --> 01:22:40,646
You could have won a bycicle.

1661
01:22:40,746 --> 01:22:41,746
A bycicle!

1662
01:22:47,299 --> 01:22:49,009
Stand up, Kroupa!

1663
01:22:49,109 --> 01:22:50,109
Sit down!

1664
01:22:50,209 --> 01:22:51,209
Stand up!

1665
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:53,811
Yes, please?

1666
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:55,877
No, nothing.

1667
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:57,188
Sorry.

1668
01:22:57,501 --> 01:22:58,627
What is it?

1669
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,345
You had a crazy night, didn't you?

1670
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:03,941
I study at night with my son

1671
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:05,523
and then get up at 5.

1672
01:23:05,623 --> 01:23:06,623
Oh, yeah.

1673
01:23:06,723 --> 01:23:07,723
Yeah, yeah.

1674
01:23:09,057 --> 01:23:10,458
Please.

1675
01:23:10,558 --> 01:23:12,459
<i>Hujer Fruits and Vegetables</i>

1676
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:13,986
I took

1677
01:23:14,086 --> 01:23:16,023
Silence. Don't disturb!

1678
01:23:16,522 --> 01:23:17,690
I took the liberty

1679
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,158
if you won't feel insulted

1680
01:23:19,258 --> 01:23:20,668
Thank you, Hujer.

1681
01:23:20,768 --> 01:23:22,335
Thank you.

1682
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:29,228
And now, we'll detect

1683
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:32,736
the presence of aluminium.

1684
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:35,671
Aluminum moved to Humpolec.

1685
01:23:35,771 --> 01:23:40,017
What is a logarithm of  a product?

1686
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:44,733
Logarithm of a product is equal to

1687
01:23:45,004 --> 01:23:46,657
the sum of the

1688
01:23:46,899 --> 01:23:49,677
logarithm of the [yawning]

1689
01:23:49,777 --> 01:23:50,777
But, dad.

1690
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,097
Factors!

1691
01:23:53,581 --> 01:23:54,935
It's a multiplication!

1692
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,782
I did say „factors“. I said it like

1693
01:23:58,882 --> 01:23:59,882
a bit differnet

1694
01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:00,982
I am learning this words, well?

1695
01:24:01,774 --> 01:24:02,899
Don't cheat!

1696
01:24:03,256 --> 01:24:06,476
On the writing test you'll be on your own.

1697
01:24:06,704 --> 01:24:08,285
I am not cheating.

1698
01:24:08,527 --> 01:24:10,152
So, listen.

1699
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:13,642
What did I say?

1700
01:24:13,742 --> 01:24:15,523
factor or term?

1701
01:24:15,805 --> 01:24:16,805
Term.

1702
01:24:16,905 --> 01:24:17,905
Now you see.

1703
01:24:18,005 --> 01:24:19,005
You suspect me wrongly

1704
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:20,952
and I actually said

1705
01:24:21,052 --> 01:24:22,052
"Chinese"

1706
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:28,104
So, how did you do that test?

1707
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:29,204
Well,

1708
01:24:29,304 --> 01:24:31,481
I solved everything.

1709
01:24:31,675 --> 01:24:34,630
George said that I did well.

1710
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:38,036
If there wasn't some trap, then

1711
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:39,300
it would be fine.

1712
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,400
Let's hope.

1713
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,862
It was a hard test. A hard one!

1714
01:24:43,962 --> 01:24:47,140
I had a lot of work with it.

1715
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:52,126
The test did not turn out the best.

1716
01:24:52,226 --> 01:24:54,506
A lot of good students disappointed me.

1717
01:24:54,748 --> 01:24:56,586
Svátek. Good.

1718
01:24:57,412 --> 01:25:00,262
Tuček, Šlajs. Satisfactory.

1719
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:02,841
Same mistakes, same grades.

1720
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:07,386
On the other hand, some poor students,

1721
01:25:07,486 --> 01:25:08,486
Kroupa,

1722
01:25:08,982 --> 01:25:12,843
Take your logarithmical tables and come here.

1723
01:25:15,165 --> 01:25:17,260
What is the result of logarithm

1724
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:20,979
Please, if Plha may hand me the glasses.

1725
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:33,674
of  3457 x 40876 / 7222

1726
01:25:34,208 --> 01:25:37,303
Please, lend me those tables.

1727
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:46,938
You give the pen, I give the tables.

1728
01:25:56,456 --> 01:25:57,610
It's correct.

1729
01:25:58,807 --> 01:26:01,072
You really know it.

1730
01:26:01,885 --> 01:26:05,190
Do you know your result from the test?

1731
01:26:05,746 --> 01:26:08,082
I don't dare guessing.

1732
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:09,835
Excellent.

1733
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,611
We study

1734
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:15,235
together with my son.

1735
01:26:15,335 --> 01:26:17,044
Great. Greet him from me.

1736
01:26:17,144 --> 01:26:18,144
Thank you.

1737
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,722
Look,

1738
01:26:26,163 --> 01:26:28,072
I'll tell you

1739
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:29,825
this is quite good.

1740
01:26:30,096 --> 01:26:31,734
It's not bad.

1741
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:34,498
Though, a Good in history? It's a shame.

1742
01:26:34,598 --> 01:26:36,579
Look my grade in history!

1743
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:38,288
But you don't have it at all, Dad.

1744
01:26:38,388 --> 01:26:40,198
No? It's a pity.

1745
01:26:40,298 --> 01:26:42,121
I would shine then, little one.

1746
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:43,945
The burning of Jan Hus -

1747
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:45,939
1415

1748
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:49,117
My God, your behaviour is Excellent.

1749
01:26:49,273 --> 01:26:50,485
I thought it was Very good.

1750
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:52,836
You aslo have it Excellent.

1751
01:26:52,936 --> 01:26:54,787
Yes, it's all right.

1752
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:55,887
Well, Dad,

1753
01:26:55,987 --> 01:26:57,808
there is this Satisfactory in math, but we'll fix it.

1754
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:02,153
It's not bad at all.

1755
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:04,918
And you also go to work,

1756
01:27:05,974 --> 01:27:07,183
you deserve a praise.

1757
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:09,677
Mom, did you hear that?

1758
01:27:09,777 --> 01:27:10,777
Pour the soup.

1759
01:27:11,704 --> 01:27:15,921
I think that we fully deserve it.

1760
01:27:16,347 --> 01:27:18,698
I said „fully“, Mommy.

1761
01:27:18,977 --> 01:27:20,431
Full.

1762
01:27:43,688 --> 01:27:44,937
What's up, George?

1763
01:27:46,157 --> 01:27:47,832
Got comfortable already?

1764
01:27:47,932 --> 01:27:49,683
I would rather not get too comfortable here.

1765
01:27:49,783 --> 01:27:51,842
Let's see the final tests.

1766
01:27:51,942 --> 01:27:54,237
It would be fine.

1767
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,190
The beginning is the most difficult.

1768
01:27:58,645 --> 01:28:01,568
AC to 004

1769
01:28:09,502 --> 01:28:11,294
Alleviate 5

1770
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:20,683
Two buns and a milk.

1771
01:28:20,783 --> 01:28:23,268
Two buns and a milk, Suzy.

1772
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:24,503
What kind? Full-fat?

1773
01:28:24,603 --> 01:28:25,603
Normal.

1774
01:28:27,544 --> 01:28:28,587
OK.

1775
01:28:35,595 --> 01:28:37,387
Hey, the executive coucil.

1776
01:28:44,763 --> 01:28:46,232
Weld!

1777
01:28:55,517 --> 01:28:57,162
We are welding!

1778
01:29:39,108 --> 01:29:40,283
Up!

1779
01:29:40,383 --> 01:29:41,383
What is this?

1780
01:29:42,178 --> 01:29:43,941
I took the liberty,

1781
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:45,734
some plums from my little garden,

1782
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:46,834
if you won't feel insulted,

1783
01:29:46,934 --> 01:29:48,481
Mr. Boss.
