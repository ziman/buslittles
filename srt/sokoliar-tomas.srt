1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,232
Did you enjoy that?

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,711
We'll show Lord Balador the falconer
Vagan is still good at his craft.

3
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,910
Tomorrow you'll go to the castle.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,353
Damned Vagan!

5
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,685
Beautiful...
Vagan promised me one like this.

6
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,475
I've been training it secretly for a year.
For you, my lord.

7
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
- Vagan is an old braggart.
- Stop it. I've heard enough!

8
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:37,474
Well, people talk, my lord.
Here you are...

9
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,999
Wonderful, indeed.

10
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,791
Once hunting, I caught sight
of the famous King Mathew's falcon.

11
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,080
For that falcon I'd give my castle
on the Danube.

12
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,277
Nobody can catch that one, my lord.

13
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,594
Come on, this way! Faster!

14
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,750
THOMAS THE FALCONER

15
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,793
- Tomorrow we'll saddle the bay.
- God help us.

16
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,230
Father, Thomas! Lunch!

17
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,757
Hurry up, men,
Grandpa is starving.

18
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,957
Come on, son.

19
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,711
Here you are.

20
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,871
Grandpa, it's not just for you.

21
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,953
Thomas!

22
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,959
Hey, calm down. I've heard you.

23
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,433
It's all right now.

24
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,031
Damned fool.

25
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,193
- You wanna get your ribs broken?
- The bay is death-ridden.

26
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,085
Yesterday you said
you were at death's door.

27
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,829
Right, but the door was sealed.
Death is scared of me.

28
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,714
Thomas, don't do that any more.

29
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,278
Oh, my...

30
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,632
How did you know about the thorn?

31
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,097
The bay was complaining.
Are you deaf?

32
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:30,995
We are all deaf except for
master Thomas.

33
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,433
What did you tell her?

34
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,475
To throw a cone at you
if you don't stop neighing.

35
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,710
Liar! You liar!

36
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,237
Just you wait.

37
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,672
You robber...

38
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,234
With that whip of yours I'll change
the bay into a lamb tomorrow.

39
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,165
You touch the stud and Lord Balador
will get you caned.

40
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,149
- The bay cost him forty cows.
- And it's won’t it, I'm telling you.

41
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,125
I've never seen
such a beauty in my life.

42
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,040
- Ostrik'll get the stud as a wedding gift.
- And he'll ride away on it...

43
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:58,040
- with beautiful Formina.
- And who is Formina?

44
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:01,271
He doesn't know who Formina is!

45
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,634
Lord Balador's daughter, born on the same
day as you only a year earlier.

46
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,795
The day you were born, at the castle
they celebrated her first birthday.

47
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,390
- So we're actually siblings.
- And I'm your Grandma! - Shut up.

48
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,120
- Forty cows for such a horse...
- Tell me about her. - Wait a moment.

49
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:35,319
Balador has offered a castle
for a falcon, just imagine.

50
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,445
The one with the golden crest?

51
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,669
The falcon belonged to the King
of Hungary. It saved his life.

52
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,157
People say so...

53
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,680
Once King Mathew got lost in the marsh.
He would have died there,

54
00:10:55,715 --> 00:11:01,596
but his hunting falcon
showed him the way out.

55
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,112
- The King rewarded the bird with
a golden crest. - And set it free.

56
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,714
- What do you know about it?
- Nothing. Everyone'd do so, I guess.

57
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,636
Our smart Thomas
knows better than anyone.

58
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,189
You're lucky the marten is asleep.

59
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,560
- The little beast...
- It's your birthday in a few days...

60
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,154
Here's your present.

61
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,965
Wolves...

62
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,790
- The wolves! - Light up a big fire.
We'll drive them off.

63
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,237
You go left, I'll go right.
We'll meet back there.

64
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,830
You stay by the fire.

65
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,599
Thomas!

66
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,110
Put more wood to the fire!

67
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,510
- Are you okay? -Yeah!

68
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,470
Over here guys, help me!

69
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,516
I've got no fire!

70
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,669
Oh, God...

71
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,355
Thomas, come back!

72
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,914
Father...

73
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,511
- Mama won't be lonesome any more.
- Now they are together again.

74
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,274
Thomas. Come on, let's go home.

75
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,028
What for? Balador will hire a new herdsman
and we can go begging.

76
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,955
Forward, jump! And back!

77
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,989
Sit...

78
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,071
Perun, fetch!

79
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,909
Bravo, Perun!

80
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,438
Me and my brother, we've prepared
a little surprise for you.

81
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,389
You are free. Run!

82
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,239
- What's this? - Be patient, my lord.

83
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,352
Perun, get him!

84
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,630
Let go!

85
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,070
- Perun, come here! - Wild beast.

86
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,513
- Isn't the lad hurt? -He deserved it.

87
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,633
- Broke a jug... - That's all?

88
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,115
And put the splinters into the dog food.
Perun could've died.

89
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,680
Punish him. But not like this.
According to the law.

90
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:41,595
Put him to the stocks and then cane him.

91
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,913
I'll plead with Lord Balador for
a piece of land. He'll remember me.

92
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,911
Once he went hunting and passed by...
I bowed and he waved at me.

93
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,274
He must remember me.

94
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,997
He will not let us go begging.

95
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,639
Again the little beast of yours...

96
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,911
You do it yourself!

97
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,716
- What have you done to her now?
- Nothing.

98
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,360
- Grandpa, can I come along?
- To the castle? No way.

99
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:31,280
You'd mess something up
and come to a bad end.

100
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:33,953
- I'd like to see Formina. - What for?

101
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,525
Maybe she'd dance with me.

102
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,160
You won't even get close to her.
If by chance you did,

103
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:48,393
Balador would burn your heels.

104
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,396
Come on!

105
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,477
Get up!

106
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,918
I'll finish you.

107
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,870
Loser! Loser!

108
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,676
Send for the healing mud.
My back was aching last night.

109
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,032
- Your husband is a weakling.
- I like him the way he is, Father.

110
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,315
Perun, to me.

111
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,237
Sit!

112
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,750
For you Formina, I've chosen
a better husband. Ostrik.

113
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,880
- But I don't wanna get married yet.
- First the betrothal...

114
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:18,565
- will take place. On your birthday.
- But that is tomorrow!

115
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,995
So what? I've prepared everything.
It will be your great day.

116
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,520
- Have I ever seen Ostrik?
- Of course, my dear.

117
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,485
On the day we signed
the wedding agreement.

118
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,834
- When was that? -You were two years old.
Ostrik was four then.

119
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:47,148
He stuck his tongue out at you,
and you hit him with a silver spoon.

120
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,798
- Hasn’t he got a bump on his head?
- Not any more. Now come with me...

121
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,790
I'm giving Ostrik the young bay
as a wedding gift. And also...

122
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,995
- this falcon. - Is this the one which
saved King Mathew? -No.

123
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,591
That one wears a golden crest.
Once I saw him by the Rocks.

124
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,205
- I've offered my castle on the Danube
for him. - Is he won’t so much?

125
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,876
- For me he is. He is indeed the king
of all falcons. The pigeon! - My lord.

126
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,435
- Feed him!
- No. I can't do that.

127
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,793
Do you want to offend me?

128
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,920
- But your old falconer...
- You remember Vagan? - Of course I do.

129
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:53,005
I liked him.

130
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,160
He told me falcons get a pigeon
only after hunting.

131
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,645
You're right.
We shouldn't spoil him.

132
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,240
- And where has Vagan gone?
- I don't know. He left. Was proud.

133
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:08,552
Once I insulted him... I'm sorry I did.

134
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,157
But Iver will replace him.
He's already trained this falcon.

135
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,580
Leave your presents
by the servants in the yard.

136
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:41,005
Our gracious Lady Formina
thanks you from her heart.

137
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,395
They won't let us in,
we have brought no presents.

138
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,832
Grandpa... Come on.

139
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,314
You wanna get into the castle?

140
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,195
Fine, come along.

141
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,599
- Why are you sitting here?
- Getting warm in the sun, you idiot.

142
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,350
- Get lost or they'll put you next to me.
- What have you done?

143
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,556
I broke a jug, that's all.

144
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,325
To the stocks for a jug?
Who ordered that?

145
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,148
- What do you think? Our lord of the castle.
- This Balador is really...

146
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,519
What did I tell you?
It is His Highness Lord Balador.

147
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,845
We have to go to the main courtyard.
His lordship won't come here.

148
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,960
- We want to congratulate the young lady...
- On behalf of the guild...

149
00:23:26,995 --> 00:23:29,633
The presents are being listed by the clerk.
Over there.

150
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,789
Nobody can go any further.
We are expecting noble guests.

151
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,913
- You're Metod from the pastures,
aren't you? - And you're...

152
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,445
- Iver. The second coachman.
- Not any more.

153
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,871
- Now I'm Lord Balador's falconer.
- A falconer? You?

154
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,395
- What do you want here?
- We've come with a request to Lord Balador.

155
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,369
- This is my grandson, Thomas.
- Maybe I could arrange something...

156
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,074
- But he stays here. Come with me.
- Don't you dare move an inch.

157
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,753
According to the law, the convict
will get twenty strokes.

158
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,077
This is the ruling of the judge!
Executioner, do your business!

159
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,678
Bite him!

160
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,756
- What's up? What's going on here?
- Something is biting me!

161
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,760
Cane him! What's the matter with you?
Are you having a fit, man?

162
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,245
- Something's biting me!
- Run!

163
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,751
- Stop it! What do think you're doing?
- Catch him!

164
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,325
You idiot!

165
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,035
Guards! Catch him!

166
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,430
Well done.

167
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,792
Come on, Sis.

168
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,917
I've got something for you.

169
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,833
From Stephen and me for your birthday.

170
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,755
May it bring happiness into your marriage
as it has to mine.

171
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,714
- You want some? - You bet!

172
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,555
When the bell up there
rings this leg is yours.

173
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,431
- And when will it ring?
- It hasn't rung for years. Has no clapper.

174
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,755
He won't get away with that.

175
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,953
I'm here.

176
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,359
Rogues have all the luck.

177
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,154
- Here you are. - Thanks.

178
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,948
Make way for the cortege
of His Highness Count Donat!

179
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,517
Smile!

180
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,433
- What a dashing young man.
- By far and wide the best suitor.

181
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,159
- How handsome he is.
- I'd like one just like him.

182
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,799
- A fine bridegroom for Formina.
- Do you know her? Formina?

183
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,277
Of course I do.
I bring the mud to the castle.

184
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,394
This? For Formina?
And what does she do with it?

185
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,869
My brother takes care of the kennel.
And this is Perun.

186
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,982
- The best of Balador's dogs.
- Quiet, Perun!

187
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,834
- Search him! Quickly!

188
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,756
Move!

189
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,709
Nothing else?

190
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,389
You want to rob this poor soul?

191
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,080
What if he's bringing a message from Vagan?
He is spreading rumours

192
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:11,597
- I stole his falcon.
- You can't compare with him!

193
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:17,291
You drove him away,
you good-for-nothing! Swindler!

194
00:29:17,326 --> 00:29:22,950
You see? He's Vagar's spy!
Careful with me, old man.

195
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,092
Allow us to offer a few birthday
presents to the future bride.

196
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,340
And now our son wants personally give
this diadem to his fiancé

197
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:54,916
which she will soon wear
on her wedding veil.

198
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,510
Go on.

199
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,317
Thank you.

200
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,877
Looks good...

201
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,710
A little heavy.

202
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,073
I meant Ostrik.

203
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,400
On account of my dear daughter
I thank you for the beautiful gifts.

204
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,789
And now, friends, to the table!

205
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,677
It is a healing mud. It takes away fever,
protects against the plague

206
00:30:52,712 --> 00:30:57,914
and refreshes one's mind.
I know a fine lord who sips it like soup.

207
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,157
To clean his bowels...

208
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,155
- But Lord Balador heats it up and sits
in it up to his neck for hours.

209
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,719
- And Formina, too?
- No. She is as sound as a bell.

210
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,599
To us! We've been good fathers,
we'll also be good fathers-in-law.

211
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,558
To the bottom!

212
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,155
Hey, that's enough!

213
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,114
- You've promised we'll dance.
- I nearly forgot. Music!

214
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,112
Go and ask Formina to dance.
Everyone is waiting...

215
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,274
- But I...
- It is your duty.

216
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,117
He's coming.

217
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,354
May I have the pleasure...

218
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,479
I'm not the best dancer but...

219
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,990
- duty is duty!
- Duty? I thought you came voluntarily.

220
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,395
- Yes, of course, but you haven't
finished eating... - Oh, no.

221
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,717
I'm not going to eat any more.

222
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,675
Would you believe
I once hit you with such a spoon?

223
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,357
Well, would you excuse me...

224
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,997
Have you seen that?

225
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,028
You were great.

226
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,676
- What happened?
- She is beautiful. - And?

227
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,959
- She wanted to hit me with a spoon.
- It's a pity she didn't.

228
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,394
I would burn my hands...

229
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,995
- What is your business here?
- I am here to dance with Formina.

230
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,550
You'll have to wait a long time.
I must wait until the gentry depart.

231
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,716
- I can see why. The stuff stinks.
- It has to stink in order to heal!

232
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,119
My mud...

233
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,273
What are you up to?

234
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,710
- What do you want here?
- You're Formina?

235
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,180
I've come to congratulate you.
It's my birthday today as well!

236
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:16,799
- You're not lying? - I swear it!

237
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,231
Do something!

238
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,032
So let's dance together.

239
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,719
Music!

240
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,638
Take my hand!

241
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,957
The mud heals...

242
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,840
Shall we jump like frogs?

243
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,716
That's enough!

244
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,597
- Who are you? - Thomas.

245
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,433
- You're forgetting something.
- Thomas, my lord,

246
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,549
the son of your herdsman
who was killed by the wolves.

247
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,445
We came here with a plea
for a piece of field... my lord.

248
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,596
- But you've spoilt my daughter's
celebration and for that... - No!

249
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,040
I wanted to dance and he fulfilled
my wish! And you said this would be...

250
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:58,229
- my great day! - I did say that.
But this is not what I meant.

251
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,549
Let the fortune decide.

252
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,351
A rose, a nice piece of land is yours.

253
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,196
An empty hand, you will get caned.

254
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,350
Now make your choice.

255
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,600
Rogues have all the luck!
The clerk will arrange it for you.

256
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:37,194
Now off, I don't wanna see your face
any more! Music!

257
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,830
- My friends... - Bravo!
- Eat, drink and be merry!

258
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,390
- Would you dance with me, my lady?
- With pleasure.

259
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,238
Grandpa?

260
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,158
Thomas. What are you wearing?

261
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,477
We got a piece of land from lord Balador.

262
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,074
- I've earned it by dancing with Formina!
- What?

263
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,556
It must have been a bewitched day.

264
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,390
You fly high... but it was me
who danced with Formina!

265
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,109
There he is! Get him!

266
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,596
- I can see him! - Halt!

267
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,280
- Leave him alone! - Let Perun off!

268
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,365
No!

269
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,631
Perun, get him!

270
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,645
Come on!

271
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,752
Be a good boy, Perun.

272
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,312
Perun, catch him!

273
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,948
Can't you hear, get him!

274
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,194
What has he done with the dog?

275
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,833
You little brat! You'll be sorry for that.

276
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,390
- Enough! Take him away.
- Quiet, come on...

277
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,245
What's wrong with him?

278
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,196
We were training Perun to track
and we ran into this boy

279
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:53,112
who danced with Lady Formina.
He did that, it's his work.

280
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,234
Such a dog is useless.

281
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,205
- Kill him. - No!

282
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,710
- Give him to me. - Take the carcass away.

283
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,189
As for this Thomas, now
I'm gonna make him dance!

284
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,957
Where have you been wandering?

285
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,915
Grandpa, does it hurt when you get caned?

286
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,316
It does.

287
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,519
I still have one...

288
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,960
And how many strokes would one get
if he'd done any harm to Perun?

289
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:49,110
Not a stroke.

290
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,188
Balador would roast him alive.

291
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,678
- Calm down, little one. - Hold it.

292
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,715
Take care of Agatha.

293
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,679
Come on.

294
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,908
Just one more thing. Come on.

295
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,440
We've come for your grandson.

296
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,160
- Thomas didn't steal the clothes.
- What clothes?

297
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:54,355
He bewitched his lordship's Perun.

298
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,316
- He's not in there.
- Search the whole place!

299
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,031
Wait here.

300
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,793
Well, what do you say?
Have you ever seen a prettier girl?

301
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,949
You're right. Me neither.

302
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,072
So let's go.

303
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,565
What are you doing here?
You've come to rob nests, huh?

304
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,230
- I don't steal! - Has perhaps Lord Balador
given you his best stud?

305
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,670
- Out with the truth.
- I turned his Perun into a harmless puppy.

306
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,272
He's sent the constables after me.
And so I took off on his bay.

307
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,640
You've heard that, Tatar?
He turned Perun into a puppy,

308
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:17,885
stole the bay and
the constables are after him.

309
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,280
We've caught a famous bandit!
We'll take his skin off

310
00:47:22,315 --> 00:47:25,317
and send it to Balador. He will pay us well.

311
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,920
- Welcome to the Rocks. I'm Vagan.
- Balador's head falconer.

312
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:46,256
Used to be. Someone slandered me
that I am no longer able

313
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:51,557
- to train a falcon. - I know all about you.
- Who told you?

314
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,030
The birds.

315
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,394
Let's go.

316
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,591
Get down. We're home.

317
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,356
We'd better hide him. Go on in.

318
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,760
What's up? Leave me alone!
That hurts! Let me go!

319
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:56,565
Zubor! Leave him, he's our guest.

320
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,000
I found him begging by the castle.
Someone had cut out his tongue,

321
00:49:01,035 --> 00:49:04,675
- afraid he might talk... - Lunch is ready!

322
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,075
Vince!

323
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,914
Long time no see, huh?! Come on in!

324
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,480
- Iver would've hunted me down
like an animal. - You cook for Vagan?

325
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:27,554
I've been promoted.
At the castle I took out the rubbish.

326
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,275
Here you go.

327
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:42,116
- Leave it. It's for Frankie.
- Who's Frankie? - You'll see.

328
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,636
- The constables! They've found me.
- And me, too!

329
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,749
Into the corner!

330
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,339
- Calm down. Coming for lunch?
- Whom do you have here?

331
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:18,838
- Just Zubor and a few animals.
- We'll take a look.

332
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,277
Two, three, four.
Two beggars eat from four plates?

333
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,640
You'd better not go there.
Frankie is sleeping there.

334
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:41,074
He hasn't eaten yet.
Might tear up your pants.

335
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,875
Who's Frankie?

336
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,597
This should scare me?

337
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,160
- You know better.
- And who eats from the fourth plate?

338
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:05,233
- Mike. - And who's that?

339
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,000
Frankie's father, a nasty fighter.
Yesterday he tore two of my dogs

340
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:19,632
to pieces. Shall I wake him up? Mike!

341
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,400
- No, we're in a hurry. - Come on out!
The gentlemen want to see you!

342
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:29,676
On the horses, let's be off!

343
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,793
To the table.

344
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,400
You've come such a distance.
You must have set off at dawn. Why?

345
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:51,240
- I wanted to see you.
- And why did you want to see me?

346
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:53,085
Because...

347
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,800
Because I liked the way
you saved the boy from punishment.

348
00:52:58,835 --> 00:53:04,240
Me? He just chose the right hand,
that's all.

349
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:08,925
And what was in your other hand?

350
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,638
You saw it? You have sharp eyes.
Sharp by name, sharp by nature.

351
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,485
I must be back by sunset.

352
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,000
My parents don't want us
to meet until the wedding.

353
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:30,857
I told them I would go hunting.

354
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:33,680
I haven't behaved honestly.

355
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:36,085
I think...

356
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,999
I can forgive you.

357
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,880
- You should go now.
- I'd like to see you again soon.

358
00:53:56,915 --> 00:54:01,840
Better not. Do you want to spend your horse?

359
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:06,416
But the day after tomorrow

360
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,957
I'll be passing this way.

361
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,085
Thomas! Are you mad? Here... by the castle!

362
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:03,240
The constables are looking for you.
Father will have you caned.

363
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:06,232
You wouldn't survive it!

364
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,920
I just wanted to tell you...

365
00:55:28,955 --> 00:55:30,645
My grandpa said...

366
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,160
I grow really fast. Soon I'll be grown up...

367
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:39,925
and strong like my father was.

368
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,670
If you could just wait I could be your...

369
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,392
Tom, I know...

370
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:58,376
I just thought Ostrik could find
another girl... I'd help him.

371
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,589
You saw us?

372
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,951
You know, I like Ostrik, I do.

373
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,032
And I love him.

374
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,445
To fall in love with my future husband...

375
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,872
I can call myself lucky.
It's not always like that.

376
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,797
I wish you all the luck.

377
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,714
For good luck... may it stay with you.

378
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,717
You're a nice boy.

379
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,594
Perun, go.

380
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,038
Thomas, come here.

381
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,880
I've been training him for months.
He's good but unpredictable.

382
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:23,599
Tie this to his foot.

383
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,629
And how is Formina?

384
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,880
What do you know about her?

385
00:57:34,915 --> 00:57:37,525
Only what you talk about...

386
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,396
in your sleep. Wash your eyes,
they are a little red.

387
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,475
It's hopeless.

388
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,080
Tatar! Halt! Back!

389
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:38,605
The fox must be rabid.

390
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,031
We have to kill it or
it'll infect all our animals.

391
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,959
What has got into you?

392
00:58:57,994 --> 00:59:01,839
He'll never come back.

393
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,765
What have you done? I tried everything...

394
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,920
I told him a falcon should not
behave like a donkey.

395
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,834
From now on, you train him.

396
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,156
Look... Thomas is sending us his greetings.

397
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,393
Frankie, come and have a bath!

398
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,405
- Wont you miss him? - I will.

399
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,685
But I know a better one.
A falcon beyond compare!

400
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,160
I know which one you mean.
I nearly trapped him with my net.

401
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:26,565
He's the king of all falcons.

402
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,085
- Shall I stop at your Grandpa's? - No need.

403
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,480
- You'll meet him at the castle.
- How do you know?

404
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:36,597
The falcon told me.

405
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,750
Hey, catch!

406
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,632
It's for Formina.

407
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:58,151
You can't go in there!
His lordship has forbidden it.

408
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,920
- I've come to beg for my grandson.
- First I want to know where he is.

409
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:12,045
- Speak! - I don't know, my lord.

410
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,915
- On my honour I don't know.
- You don't know? I don't believe you!

411
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,565
- You should, my lord. - Vagan!
- Metod is an honest man.

412
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,200
- You've come to tell me that?
- I've brought you a falcon, my lord.

413
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:32,137
- And that's why I should believe you?
- This one is better than

414
01:02:32,172 --> 01:02:37,039
- the one Iver stole from me.
- Liar! Can you prove that?

415
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,045
Tell his lordship who gave you this scar.

416
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,194
You can keep your field
unless you deliver me Thomas.

417
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:50,309
If I find him myself
his punishment will be worse.

418
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,709
Get lost, you old fool.

419
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,390
I like him. We'll try him after lunch.

420
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,805
I saw a rat in the tower.

421
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:20,040
- If Balador sees it...
Where is the rat poison? - Over there.

422
01:03:22,075 --> 01:03:25,077
But careful with it.

423
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:59,480
- You're not saying much, Vagan.
- Because I know little.

424
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:03,445
This morning you spoke more.

425
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,005
Now I know even less
than I did this morning.

426
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,716
What counts is the falcon knows
what he has to know.

427
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,153
Let us begin.

428
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:46,116
Where is he flying?

429
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:02,160
You wanted to make a fool of me?
You've brought me a carcass.

430
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:07,756
The rabbit gave him heart attack!

431
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,125
Did you poison my falcon?

432
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,474
- I know nothing.
- And you brother "the falconer"?

433
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,640
- I've seen nothing.
- 'Cause you didn't want to see!

434
01:05:37,675 --> 01:05:41,205
You're lucky I don't like
when people get whipped.

435
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:46,713
And tell Iver to stay out of my way.
He's got one scar already.

436
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,756
My lady...

437
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,829
- Vagan! - I've got something for you.

438
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,395
You know where Thomas is?

439
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:24,200
Tell him, I'd like to dance with him
one more time before I get married.

440
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:27,668
Let's go.

441
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,431
Hey, hands off from the nest!

442
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:41,365
You'll pay for this.
I'm Lord Balador's falconer!

443
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,240
- I'm following his orders.
- Liar! You're stealing the eggs.

444
01:07:45,275 --> 01:07:51,270
Nonsense. You've hurt my arm. Help me...

445
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,760
He was stealing falcon eggs
and Lord Balador is looking for him

446
01:08:31,795 --> 01:08:35,514
- because of Perun. - Put him down!

447
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,395
Move back!

448
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:44,840
Lord Balador will punish everyone
who helps him escape and...

449
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:50,080
Shut up, Iver. Now you listen to me!

450
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:53,285
You poisoned the falcon.

451
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,840
You used to be my pupil,
taught you everything.

452
01:08:55,875 --> 01:09:00,868
And you've turned out to be a filthy thief.

453
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,712
Look: Hawk, sparrow hawk, peregrine.
The falconer robs his lord.

454
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,674
Stop that evil man!

455
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,190
Shoot him yourself if you feel like that...

456
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,476
He poisoned our falcon, alas!

457
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:42,193
We won't find a better one.

458
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,470
And what about that one?

459
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,365
It's him. The falcon king.

460
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,920
For him Balador would
forgive you everything.

461
01:09:57,955 --> 01:10:02,596
He'd also give me a castle.

462
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,805
Repair it! Stitch it again!

463
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,437
- Does it suit me?
- You're a beautiful bride.

464
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,551
Enchanting.

465
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,716
Sugar...

466
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,910
Get lost!

467
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,925
My lord, I trained the falcon
you gonna give to Ostrik...

468
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,400
- What do you want? Spit it out!
- Could I be the head falconer?

469
01:11:23,435 --> 01:11:27,280
- Your time will come.
- You should know that Vagan...

470
01:11:27,315 --> 01:11:31,831
Do you know anything else
besides tale-bearing?

471
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,152
We're slow. I have to exercise my horse.
I'll meet you at the castle.

472
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,594
- Still the same hothead.
- Don't worry, he'll get tamed soon.

473
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:31,040
- And where is Ostrik?
- He has to be here any moment now.

474
01:12:31,275 --> 01:12:34,885
He rode ahead, was impatient.

475
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:40,358
He's savouring the last moments
of his freedom. Please...

476
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,672
What do you want from me?

477
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,756
I'm thirsty.

478
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,710
I know you!

479
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,005
You made a big mistake.

480
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:22,160
Now you won't get out alive.
I'm not going to the gallows.

481
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:25,470
Why are you holding me here?
What are you up to?

482
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,513
It's none of your business.
I'm settling accounts.

483
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:44,716
If I discover a corpse here,
a reward would not come amiss.

484
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,200
I'm going to bed. If Ostrik appears
tell the maid to wake me up!

485
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:22,635
- I'd like to talk to him.
- No trace at all, nothing, my lord.

486
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:29,635
It's not possible! Looks like he
disappeared into thin air!

487
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:36,560
Take more men and keep
looking until you find him!

488
01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:39,074
And bring us new candles.

489
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,469
Fly!

490
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,760
- We're looking for Ostrik.
- What would he do here?

491
01:16:00,795 --> 01:16:03,957
We'll see. Search the place!

492
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,560
Stand up. Let's go.

493
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,758
Here's another one.

494
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,725
And here's the evidence!

495
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,878
Tie them up. They are criminals!

496
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,535
It belongs to Ostrik.
I gave it to him myself.

497
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,125
We found it in Vagar’s cottage.

498
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:06,075
- I bet they've robbed and murdered Ostrik.
- Vagan!

499
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:12,108
And Thomas! At last I've got you.
Where is Ostrik?

500
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,880
You're asking us? We know nothing.
We weren’t invited to the wedding.

501
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:18,996
Thomas...

502
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,798
- Where is Ostrik?
- I drowned him in the mud. - Be serious!

503
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:29,557
- Do you know anything about him?
- Let me go and I'll find him.

504
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,671
Put them into the torture chamber!
The judge will try them!

505
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,840
- What have you found out?
- They denied everything stubbornly.

506
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:04,285
But the small one, Zubor, gave them away.

507
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:09,485
When he saw the red-hot iron
he nodded to everything.

508
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:15,100
- Anyway, this evidence is undeniable.
- And your verdict?

509
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:21,990
A life for a life, Your Highness.

510
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,514
Start building the gallows.

511
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,989
And hurry up!

512
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,117
Thank you.

513
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,197
Thomas!

514
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:28,132
I begged my father but he doesn't want
to listen. I can't help you.

515
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,445
Tell me, what have you done to Ostrik?

516
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:40,874
If you believe we're able to kill
you'd better go. Get out of my sight!

517
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,520
Wait!

518
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,119
Watch out!

519
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,996
I'll be back for you.

520
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,599
Be careful.

521
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,994
I'll find Ostrik for you even in hell.

522
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,192
Find Ostrik, find him.

523
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,319
What are you looking at?
You can't help me.

524
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,595
Sign here, my lord.

525
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:02,540
Father, how can you believe
Vagan or Thomas to be murderers?!

526
01:24:02,575 --> 01:24:07,680
You can't send them to death.
Ostrik will return, I'm sure.

527
01:24:07,715 --> 01:24:12,231
I believe he's alive because I love him.

528
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:56,995
Hey, help me! I'm here!

529
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,391
- You're all right? -My leg...

530
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:15,365
- How did you find me?
- Not me... he did.

531
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,640
He flew around my ears and
shouted "help Ostrik". So I came.

532
01:25:19,675 --> 01:25:23,519
I had nothing else to do. Come on.

533
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,645
You understand the bird speech,
you suckling?

534
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:35,471
Sometimes better than the human speech,
you bridegroom!

535
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:42,520
- I've seen you somewhere.
- Maybe in the mud? - You're that dancer...

536
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:47,640
that insolent boy!
I wanted to give you a good hiding!

537
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,838
When you get well we can fight.

538
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,395
But now hold on so that
I don't lose you on the way.

539
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,845
These criminals have caused deep grief...

540
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:31,296
to Lord Donat, his wife, my daughter
Formina and to us all.

541
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:38,113
The judge decided they should be
hanged for their evil deed.

542
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,240
- My spur was the only evidence?
- Yeah. It was enough for the judge.

543
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:49,837
A judge like that ought
to get hanged himself! Wait.

544
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,400
- I've still got the other one.
- Other what?

545
01:26:53,435 --> 01:26:57,871
- The other spur! - And I've got the falcon.

546
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:13,753
Fly!

547
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,353
...justice. A life for a life!

548
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,205
Hangman,

549
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,800
do your business!

550
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,510
Here with it!

551
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,359
- Ostrik! - Hangman, hold it!

552
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:08,198
I am here! Stop that!

553
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,830
Ostrik!

554
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,836
Ostrik!

555
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,756
He's injured.

556
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,357
That's the man who wanted to kill me!

557
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,910
- Iver! - Let me go!

558
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,072
Ostrik...

559
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,389
Formina...

560
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,605
We almost executed innocent men.

561
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,165
Iver indicated to me
it was your wish, my lord...

562
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,116
You should follow the law
and your conscience, not Iver.

563
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:59,032
I don't need a judge like that.
You'll go to the stocks.

564
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:04,720
- You're pale. - Just tired.

565
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:07,393
Come on, let's go.

566
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:15,000
- Thomas! - You little wanderer.
Do I have to cut the wood myself?

567
01:29:17,035 --> 01:29:19,525
Grandpa, come on...

568
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:24,725
I'll forgive you Perun...
Haven’t you worn out my bay?

569
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:30,720
- No. Anyway, it belongs to Ostrik now.
- You're forgetting something.

570
01:29:30,755 --> 01:29:32,756
My lord.

571
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:53,639
It's the falcon king.
How did you achieve that?

572
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,600
I've promised a castle for him.
Now you are lord of a castle.

573
01:29:58,635 --> 01:30:02,677
I don't want a castle. I'll keep the falcon.

574
01:30:02,712 --> 01:30:06,685
In that case I'll make you my head falconer.

575
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,680
You've already got Vagan.
But when you go hunting...

576
01:30:11,715 --> 01:30:16,640
- I will borrow you the falcon... my lord.
- My lord.

577
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:18,756
My lord...

578
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,473
I have wronged you, falconer.

579
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,156
You decide on his punishment.

580
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:59,873
I grant him mercy. But I will not ever
see him again in this region.

581
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,953
So be it.

582
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,565
Thank you for Ostrik and for me, Thomas.

583
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,760
- Without your help he wouldn't be here.
- I'd like to dance from joy.

584
01:31:14,795 --> 01:31:18,725
But Ostrik can't.
Would you substitute for him?

585
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:24,030
It is not proper under the gallows.
Besides, I miss the healing mud.

586
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,589
Keep it.

587
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,073
Leave it now. Go...

588
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:11,269
- We've come for you.
- Would you like to come with us?

589
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:17,959
I need a good falconer.

590
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:23,800
I'll think about it.
Maybe I'll fly to you one day.

591
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:29,113
The sooner the better.
